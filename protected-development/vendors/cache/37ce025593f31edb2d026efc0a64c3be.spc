<p>Yeah. Stop that. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea.<span id="more-1370"></span></p>
<p>This may seem like strange advice. After all, job descriptions <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2013/07/lets-dial-back-the-job-description/" title="Let’s Dial Back the Job Description">tend toward the ridiculous</a> when it comes to stating requirements. We&#8217;re supposed to be cross-functional employees who &#8220;wear lots of hats&#8221; and &#8220;pitch in wherever is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s a fun activity: The next time you meet a doctor, find out their specialty. Then, ask them about their thoughts in a completely different area of medicine. </p>
<p>Guess what? They probably won&#8217;t want to answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/indianapolis_jobs_surgeons_at_work_65t1u25rz.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full" id="indianapolis_jobs_surgeons_at_work_65t1u25rz.jpg" alt="Indianapolis jobs - Surgeons at work" width="500" height="352" /><br />&copy; Flickr user Army Medicine</p>
<p>Keep in mind that doctors are among the most educated and most highly paid professionals in our society. And although every doctor knows a little bit about virtually every branch of medicine, doctors are highly specialized.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t want to answer because they are not an expert in that area. A doctor who says &#8220;I do a little of everything: some heart surgery, some pediatrics, a bit of psychotherapy, and I also do run some pharmaceutical research&#8221; sounds pretty strange. </p>
<p>You should take this to heart when you meet people. <strong>Don&#8217;t list off all of the random skills you have.</strong> Remember, this is someone you&#8217;re meeting for the first time. If you do, one of the following is going to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>They will zero in on something you happen to mention, and you&#8217;ll get pigeonholed as doing something that isn&#8217;t your strongest suit</li>
<li>They will stumble across an area where they have more expertise (&#8220;Vous parlez français? C&#8217;est fantastique!&#8221;) and you&#8217;ll look foolish for mentioning it</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll seem like a know-it-all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number three is a doozy. If people think you&#8217;re bragging or stretching the truth, you are now creating a bad reputation for yourself.</p>
<p>So is it bad to have a wide array of interests? Is it damaging to bring those into a potential job?</p>
<p><strong>Of course not. It&#8217;s just not something you want to say when you meet someone for the first time.</strong></p>
<p>So what should you say instead?</p>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;re going to talk about what you do professionally, <strong>give them your profession.</strong> Say you&#8217;re a project manager. Tell them you&#8217;re an accountant. Explain you work in outside sales. Indicate that you&#8217;re in marketing. </p>
<p>But don&#8217;t say I do a little of everything. Because if you do, you might be perceived as someone who actually does a whole lot of nothing.</p>

<p>One common practice is to use words in job descriptions that make me do a double-take.  For instance, “the ability to work in a low-trust/high action environment desired.”  This was listed in a job for a social media manager.  “Low-trust/high-action environment” sounds like a gangster movie.<span id="more-1350"></span></p>
<p>Another job required “proven success in a matrixed organization.”  What the heck does that mean?  (Clearly, I&#8217;m not alone in my confusion.  Spell-check agrees.)  It&#8217;s not even an adjective, and Dictionary.com defines &#8216;matrix&#8217; as “something that constitutes the point from which something else originates&#8221;.  Do they want someone who has experience at a start-up company?  Or maybe they want a candidate who knows how to make a fortune with a pyramid scheme.</p>

<p>One more example, which I found in an ad for the infamous Development/Marketing Director:  Must be a ‘creative thinker who can work critically.’  Isn&#8217;t that two different types of people?  I say infamous, because in my experience, those combo positions really do require two different skill sets and are often doomed to fail.  Although there is some cross-over in duties, successful people in each of those jobs are simply cut from a different cloth.</p>
<p><strong>Remember your ABC&#8217;s</strong></p>
<p>Job descriptions should follow the ABC method of writing:  accuracy, brevity and clarity.  All jobs will have nuances pertinent to the skills and experience required, but let’s not gets carried away with superfluous descriptions.  Say what you mean, succinctly.</p>
<p>My advice to employers?  Run your job description by a few people to see if it makes sense to them.  There are perfectly good words out there that would cause far less confusion.</p>
<p>For job seekers like myself, don’t fixate too much on one or two items on a job description.  You now have your first question prepared for when you land that interview.</p>
<p>If you find out what a matrixed organization is, let me know!</p>

<p>I joined the ranks of the unemployed about 3 weeks ago.  I&#8217;m looking for jobs in Indianapolis. Since then, I&#8217;ve made a couple observations: I think the fact I’ve not heard from some former co-workers is a form of survivor’s guilt.  On the flip side, I&#8217;ve been incredibly touched by emails, cards, phone calls and time spent over a coffee or a beer by people whom until this happened, I considered merely acquaintances.  Their sentiments have helped me get through what is a not-so-pleasant but necessary by-product of losing one’s job:  looking for another.<span id="more-1341"></span></p>
<p>In doing just that, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that there must be a course that HR managers all attend:  “How to Craft a Job Descriptions with Unrealistic Expectations.”  I understand everyone is doing more with less, but some of these descriptions make me tired just reading them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/job_description_9r3bzctfs.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full" id="job_description_9r3bzctfs.jpg" alt="Job Description" width="500" height="332" /><br />&copy; Flickr User MichiganFirstCU</p>
<p>I’m looking for work in marketing, public relations, media relations or promotions.  What often begins as a reasonable description of duties takes a turn down the path of what would surely be the road to burn-out. Lists of job requirements with 25 or more tasks are the norm.  The most prevalent practice is to include a myriad of software and other specialized skills:  graphic design, video editing, photo editing, fundraising software, web design and more.</p>
<p>Indy is ripe with a plethora of talented creative types.  My advice to employers?  Hire them.  These wonderfully imaginative people have spent years honing their craft.  Your print collateral, imaging, video and website will look and function markedly better for it.  Making sure your project is done right by the <a href="http://joshhumble.com/blog/you-photograph-weddings-pets-portraits-cars-and-thingamajigs-too/">right professional</a> is important.  You’ll enjoy greater productivity in your employees who are not trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.</p>
<p>My advice to job seekers?  If you see a skill listed as ‘required’ and it’s a skill you just don’t have, apply anyway.  It may be something an employer is willing to pay for you to receive training in, or something you can easily learn yourself.   It may also be something that is not integral to the job at all.  Be inquisitive!  You have just as much at stake by asking questions as does the employer.  Ask the right questions, and you may be surprised to find you’re more qualified than you thought!</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/teamwork_and_collaboration_5sdu707d6.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full" id="teamwork_and_collaboration_5sdu707d6.jpg" alt="Teamwork and Collaboration" width="500" height="304" /><br />&copy; Flickr User Unhindered by Talent</p>
<p>What does it mean to work together? <strong>People playing the game tug of war are all working hard</strong> at the same time, but they are not actually collaborating. Too often our relationships at work are like this game. We are pulling and it seems like someone else is pulling in the opposite direction. They may be a colleague or a supervisor, but it&#8217;s a wonder we get anything done if we are working at cross purposes.</p>
<p><strong>As with most workplace issues, the answer to this challenge is communication.</strong> Instead of the patronizing message I used the opening of this blog post, consider saying the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m looking forward to working on this project. But before I dive in&#8212;are you looking for my feedback and ideas, or do you need me to focus on making progress with the way you&#8217;ve described things?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great question to ask because it forces the other person to give a clear response. Either outcome is acceptable. Sometimes, the requirements of the project mean there is no room for discussion. The deadline is too short, or needs are too complicated to explain to someone new.</p>
<p>But often, the project does benefit from collaboration. Often, talking through the issues to figure out <strong>why we do it that way</strong> will help you be better at your job. And sometimes, you might even discover a better way to do things!</p>
<p>Collaboration is essential in any job. So be sure and use this approach and this word, but only when you mean it.</p>

<p>Here’s a typical conversation I have with someone after one of these events. My thoughts are in <em>(italics)</em>. </p>
<p>Me: “Hi, I’m Robby Slaughter”</p>
<p>Them: “Hi, I’m Jill Smith.”</p>
<p>Me: “Hi Jill. How can I help you?”</p>
<p>Them: “Well, I’m looking for a job.”</p>
<p>Me: “Okay. <em>(You and 11 million other people.)</em>”</p>
<p>Them: “Well, I’d like to work maybe in healthcare.”</p>
<p>Me: “Sure. <em>(Now we’ve narrowed down to 1/5th of the entire US economy.)</em>”</p>
<p>Them: “I’m actually a nurse. I’ve been a nurse for 20 years. I’ve mostly worked in surgical units, but I’ve also spent some time in public health education and also in the ICU.”</p>
<p>Me: “Wow, that’s amazing. <em>(Really, it is.)</em> So are you looking for a certain kind of nursing job?”</p>
<p>Them: “No, I actually want to get out of nursing.”</p>
<p>Me: “Oh yeah? <em>(So why did you tell me all that?)</em>”</p>
<p>Them: “Yeah. Maybe something in case management. But not at a hospital, like at an assisted living facility.”</p>
<p>Me: “Right! <em>(Why didn’t you say that in the first place? Now I&#8217;m trying to forget you&#8217;re a nurse.)</em>”</p>
<p>Them: “I&#8217;ve applied to some, but I think they see that I have been a hospital nurse for so long, and figure I will go back there when the the economy improves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;I can see why you might think that <em>(considering that your résumé probably lists a bunch of hospitals.)</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the time I leave those thoughts in my head. But lately I’ve been saying some of them out loud!</p>
<p>It’s not that I begrudge jobseekers who are trying to figure out what they want. This is an absolutely essential part of the process of finding work.</p>
<p>It’s just that jobseekers seem to be figuring out what they want with anyone they happen to meet, instead of working this out in private before networking with new people.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: if we&#8217;re only going to meet for a minute or two and you spend most of that time discovering yourself in front of me, <strong>I&#8217;m only going to remember you as someone is who is not sure what they want.</strong></p>
<p>And this isn&#8217;t really about me. Because if you&#8217;re unclear to me when we meet for a minute or two, <strong>you&#8217;re probably unclear to everyone you meet.</strong></p>
<p>Get some clarity. Ask a friend to hold you accountable. Practice what you are going to say and make a first impression worthy of your experience and expertise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to listen. And if you&#8217;re clear, I might even be able to help.</p>

<p>Successful entrepreneurs such as Rick Cersari of George Foreman grill fame and Brett D. Reizen with Entertainment Benefits Group, LLC, got their starts by finding ways to grow their companies without burning through cash, according to Business Insider. Consider five ways &mdash; in addition to <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2013/04/protect-your-business-from-identity-theft/">protecting your business</a> from identity theft &mdash; you can keep money in the bank, where it belongs, as you build your empire.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Indianapolis-Company-Cost-Savings.jpg" alt="Cutting costs" width="424" height="283" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1235" /></p>
<h3>1. Create a Barter Network</h3>
<p>You are not the only company owner out there looking to make bank. Finding ways to barter is a practical approach to cutting back on operating expenses, stated on The Street. With a barter exchange program, companies in the network use a credit system for services or goods. For example, a marketing firm might offer to do one digital campaign to earn one credit with a printer. That company might bank up credits over time to use when they need business cards for executives or brochures for a job.</p>
<h3>2. Think Refurbished</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to buy new to upgrade. A company looking to supply sales reps with laptops or vehicles should look into purchasing off-lease or refurbished models. Large companies may lease cars and electronics and then trade them out when new models come out. Their need to dazzle can work in your favor, and you might end up with a better piece of equipment than you could afford brand-new.</p>
<p>Put that same thought process into furnishing an office. Buying brand-new furniture is a waste unless you need to impress. Companies may stock the back offices with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/startups-7-ways-to-cut-operations-costs-2012-8">used equipment</a> and put their money in places that guests see.</p>
<h3>3. Keep the Postal Worker Happy</h3>
<p>Address standardization means making address formats uniformed. For companies that do a lot of mailing, this is a key factor in saving on postage charges. The most practical way to get this done is by utilizing software to create databases. Implementing <a href="http://www.qas.com/products/address-standardization.htm">standardized addresses</a> allows you to reduce the expense of resending undeliverable mail and create a timesaving postage system at the same time.</p>
<h3>4. Let Technology Help You Streamline</h3>
<p>Mobile devices can streamline your operations and save money, according to The National Federation of Independent Business. Here are some ways to use mobile devices to cut down on business costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the cloud for data storage to reduce costs on hardware.</li>
<li>With everything stored using cloud technology, you can use a tablet computer for customer documents. If they need a hard copy of something, send it by email or Internet fax right from the tablet.</li>
<li>Create digital presentations you can show on the tablet, which saves money on printed material.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Make Use of the Freebies</h3>
<p>One of the most positive changes the Internet brought into the business world is digital marketing. Social media is a proactive way to promote your brand and costs the company nothing but time. Make use of the mainstream networking sites for marketing to increase your Internet presence. Use these platforms for customer service and lead generation.

<p>It turns out that basically everyone I ask this question to shakes their head. For some reason, we tend to keep our job search secret. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>If you need a job, you cannot be shy about your job search.</strong></p>
<p>Shout it from the rooftops! Tell your friends. Tell your acquaintances. Reach out to the people that you have not talked to in a while and let them know.</p>
<p>If someone doesn&#8217;t know you are looking for work, they can&#8217;t help you find your next job.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be shy. Spread the word.</p>

<h3>Save emails for later in the day</h3>
<p>Scott Hanselman, Microsoft&rsquo;s program manager of development, knows a thing or two about productivity. At a recent SXSW Austin conference, Hanselman counseled listeners to avoid email in the morning and trust that urgent items sitting in your inbox will make it to your desk eventually. Hanselman&rsquo;s advice makes sense. Perhaps you&#8217;re missing a request for a routine report sitting in your inbox. That&#8217;s okay if you&#8217;re spending your time researching different options that will save your company money month after month. By dedicating the first portion of your day to items that will have lasting impact instead of plowing through your inbox looking to please coworkers and meet demands from the corner office, you can take control of your day instead of letting messages from others control you.</p>

<h3>Come to a clean desk</h3>
<p>If you think disorganization doesn&rsquo;t come with a cost, think again. A recent study, cited in the Huffington Post, suggests that messy habits may cost the average worker 76 hours annually in lost productivity. That&#8217;s nearly two weeks worth of time that brings absolutely no revenue into your business. Instead of letting your desk become a paperwork monster that feeds on lost opportunities, take a few minutes at the end of each day to organize it so you can hit the ground running the next morning.</p>
<h3>Take Frequent Breaks</h3>
<p>Tony Schwartz, CEO of The Energy Project, advocates working with a tight focus on the task at hand &mdash; for 90 minutes at a time. It&rsquo;s great advice. Work intensely, but punctuate your day with short breaks to allow you time to refresh and refocus. Take a walk, <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2013/03/social-media-the-unintended-consequences/">browse social media</a> or have a chat by the water cooler. When you return to your work and get ready to take on the next assignment, you&#8217;ll be able to bring far more attention and energy to productivity.</p>
<h3>Stay Hopeful</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the to-do list can seem so daunting that it&rsquo;s hard to see how you&#8217;ll ever get through it, let alone deliver quality results. Still, it&rsquo;s very important to stay hopeful because the link between a hopeful outlook and productivity is very real. As Dr. Shane Lopez, author of &ldquo;Making Hope Happen,&rdquo; points out that hopeful professionals close more deals, create more opportunities and generally perform better.</p>
<h3>Take the First Step</h3>
<p>Occasionally, there&rsquo;s something to be said for a little procrastination. As consultant Carson Tate points out, procrastination &mdash; if you pay attention to it in your own life &mdash; can actually help you clarify priorities and increase creativity. Unfortunately, no matter how clear your priorities are or how creative you&rsquo;ve become, there comes a time when a project simply has to get underway. That can be daunting, but the key is just to take the first step. At that moment, don&rsquo;t commit to anything beyond that initial push. Most often, you&rsquo;ll find that the first step leads inexorably into the second, and the second into the third. -Juan Vasquez.</p>

<h3>Save for Retirement</h3>
<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;ve just opened an account with a bank. You&rsquo;re making your monthly deposits. Your account is growing and you feel that you&rsquo;re now setting yourself up for a vibrant retirement.</p>
<h3>Wait, Didn&#8217;t This Just Happen to Jason Bateman?</h3>
<p>Now, imagine getting a phone call from representatives from that bank informing you that your identity has been stolen (this may remind you of that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024432/">recent movie</a>, &#8220;Identity Thief&#8221;). As you respond in astonishment, they continue telling you that three bank accounts have been opened in your name, you are the recipient of a new credit card, and your address has been changed to an abandoned house out of state.</p>

<h3>It Happened to Someone in Indiana?</h3>
<p>Your life has been destroyed. The damage, though partially repairable, has been done. The worst part of this scenario is that it actually happened in Indiana last year, according to Indianapolis Business Journal. A former financial planner carried out this exact scenario and stole the identity of 8,000 people and caused tens of thousands of dollars in damages.</p>
<h3>HEA 1101</h3>
<p>Indiana residents, you&rsquo;ll want to remember that.</p>
<p>HEA 1101 is a law that was passed in 2006 to protect you from identity theft. Based on a lengthy string of security breaches and computer robberies, Indiana put HEA 1101 into motion. What does HEA 1101 outline?</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s Simple, Really</h3>
<p>If a <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2012/04/the-paradox-of-showing-weakness-in-business/">security breach occurs</a> to a business located in Indiana &mdash; any business &mdash; that business&rsquo;s clients must be notified within a short period of time. This must also happen if there is suspected system breech.</p>
<p>HEA 1101 applies to any business that operates in Indiana, but may not be physically located in Indiana. In addition, 34 states have adopted a similar identity-theft precaution. Businesses utilizing <a href="http://www.ibj.com/local-financial-planner-sentenced-for-identity-theft/PARAMS/article/36629">HEA 1101</a> must comply with those states laws as well, states insideindianabusiness.com.</p>
<h3>What Happened in Pennsylvania?</h3>
<p>There is a copywriting business located in Pennsylvania. For whatever reason financially or otherwise, its products (newsletters, pamphlets) ship from a distribution center and its payment processing division has an Indiana address. If there is a breach, that copywriting company must immediately notify its clients.</p>
<p>HEA 1101 also has provisions for mass <a href="http://www.identitytheftlabs.com">identity breaches</a>. If $250,000 or more in damages is reported, the company must put a notification on their website. The company will then contact local TV networks to broadcast information about the breach.</p>
<h3>No Hope &#8230; Or is There?</h3>
<p>Sounds intimidating, right? It is. <a href="http://www.lifelock.com">Identity-theft protection services</a>&nbsp;suggest monitoring all business activity closely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of all bills, credit card payments, and other financial transactions.</li>
<li>Email alerts from banks are also helpful.&nbsp; Identity thieves are also known to target inactive businesses.</li>
<li>For these types of businesses, all records should be checked and filed with the state.</li>
<li>If the business is not making money any more, the best choice may be to close the doors to prevent any further damage.</li>

<p>But lately, more  and more people have been telling me they want to change their career. They are tired of what they have been doing for years and are ready to try something new. Maybe they used to work in non-profit marketing and now want to go into pharmaceutical sales. Or perhaps they were trained as an accountant, but are looking to work in healthcare. Or maybe they have tons of retail experience but want to switch to an office job.</p>
<p>I feel for people who want to change their jobs. It’s a big decision to walk away from what you used to do and go after something new. But it seems like most of these people seeking new Indianapolis jobs aren’t thinking about one crucially important element.</p>
<p>They aren’t considering the point of view of a company that would be hiring them.</p>
<p>Consider one young woman I met who went to school to become an environmental engineer. She ended up taking a field job that involved working outdoors to take samples and going back to the lab to run tests. But after a few years, she decided that she wanted to do something entirely different. She wanted to get into the veterinary world and work with animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/vets_office_5popqn3n0.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full" id="vets_office_5popqn3n0.jpg" alt="vet\'s office" width="500" height="439" /><br />&copy; Flickr User ccox888</p>
<p>If you apply to work in a vet clinic with years of experience as an engineer, you’re probably going to get turned down. That’s because there are other candidates who have years of experience in vet clinics. So you are, by nature, less attractive to that employer.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you can’t change your career. But rather, it means that <strong>changing your career is about telling the right story</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if you were an environmental engineer who worked in the field, you might explain how you are self-motivated and can work for long periods of time with no supervision. You might also explain how you love nature and have a scientific mind. You might also show how you have volunteered with pet shelters and rescue organizations. And you might try to network your way into a vet clinic by making friends with a current employee.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to change your career. But if you want to make it easier on yourself, think of the career change from the perspective of the employer. Ask the question: why should they consider someone who <em>hasn’t </em>been doing this for years?</p>
<p>Answer that, and your new career is sure to blossom.</p>
