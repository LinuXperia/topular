Give a whitepaper a try to boost engagement and reach new potential customers. A whitepaper may sound vague, but it&#8217;s simply an exchange: You provide a piece of content and your customers provide their contact information to access your white paper.</p>
<p>The great thing about white papers is that you&#8217;re not bound by a specific layout or standard. There&#8217;s no template to follow, and as long as you&#8217;re not cribbing from someone else&#8217;s work, go for it. For example, a moving company could create a white paper full of tips for customers getting ready for a cross country move while a tech startup would offer a case study or FAQ on their product. Anything goes, as long as the information is something potential customers would find useful. In our case, we have a resource guide filled with tools to jump start your marketing or get back on track if you&#8217;ve gone astray.</p>
<p><strong>Now What?</strong></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve created a white paper filled with information people can&#8217;t get anywhere else, you need to protect it to complete the exchange. You can do this by creating a contact wall. Think of it as a door locked by a security card and a customer&#8217;s email address is their access card. We use Formstack for our contact wall, since the WordPress plugin integrates seamlessly into a landing page or blog post. When a customer submits their email address, they are instantly taken to a PDF of the whitepaper they can download, print or forward to a friend. Formstack keeps those shiny new email address safe until I&#8217;m ready to access them. Another perk is that I can see where customers are coming from and the abandon rate, which lets me know if I need to make changes to the form to increase the conversion rate.</p>
<p>Email addresses from whitepaper customers ensure your newsletter list is full of quality email addresses for people who want to hear from you. You can now keep in touch with them. These people originally searched you out for your whitepaper, but now they&#8217;re going to get regular updates from you and you&#8217;ll be at the top of their mind when they&#8217;re ready to buy.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to put your new whitepaper on your website, send it out in one of your newsletters, include it on social media and promote it like you would any other noteworthy piece of information. If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about whitepapers or Internet marketing in general, give us a call.

So, how do you get all of this great stuff embedded in your web pages?</p>
<p>My tips below apply directly to self-hosted WordPress websites. If you&#8217;re not on WordPress, check your website software&#8217;s help documents or call your web developer.</p>
<h2>Easy embeds with WordPress 3.5+</h2>
<p>Recent updates to WordPress make putting videos on your website super easy, without code. The method boils down to a simple action we&#8217;ve all been doing since we learned how to work a computer: <a title="How to Copy, Cut and Paste" href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/55095847329/introducing-instagram-web-embeds" target="_blank">copy and paste</a>. Try the following steps with your favorite YouTube video.</p>
<p>Simply copy the URL of the video from your web browser&#8217;s address bar. Then, paste the URL onto its own line in your page or post. WordPress will automatically convert that URL into an embedded video when visitors load your page. It works the same way for Vimeo, another popular video sharing website. You can even share pictures from the most popular photo sites, <a title="Instagram Web Embeds" href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/55095847329/introducing-instagram-web-embeds" target="_blank">including Instagram</a>, with the same action.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33678" src="http://www.roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Visual-Editor.jpg" alt="Visual Editor" width="625" height="200" /></p>
<p>Now, this tip works with a limited list of websites. WordPress won&#8217;t convert every link into embedded content. Make sure you <a title="Embeds - WordPress.org" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">read the full list of  easy embeds</a> supported by WordPress on the WordPress.org Codex.</p>
<p>One prominent site missing from the list is Vine. You&#8217;ll have to jump through a few hoops to <a title="Vine for Small Business" href="http://www.roundpeg.biz/2013/04/vine-social-media-video-for-small-business/" target="_blank">embed Vine videos</a> and other content not supported by the easy embed method. You&#8217;ll be working with embed codes and the text editor instead.</p>
<h2>How to Use Embed Codes</h2>
<p>Many websites will provide you with an HTML embed code of their own, including most of those on <a title="Embeds - WordPress.org" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">the WordPress embeds list</a>. A typical embed code includes the complete HTML needed for your website to display the content. You&#8217;ll generally find this embed code among other sharing options displayed on the content page. Let&#8217;s return to YouTube to see how you can embed content manually using an embed code and the WordPress text editor.</p>
<p>First, locate the content online that you want to embed in your blog post or webpage. Try to find the page dedicated to the particular piece of content you want. On YouTube, that means finding the individual video page for the video you want.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find <a title="Share Videos - YouTube Help" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57741?hl=en" target="_blank">YouTube&#8217;s sharing options</a> below the video itself. Click share and choose embed from the choices. You&#8217;ll be presented with an embed code that starts with &#8220;iframe.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t Apple&#8217;s entry into the picture framing industry; it&#8217;s just a slice of HTML that shows part of YouTube through a frame embedded in your website.</p>
<p>Select all of the iframe code. Make sure your selection has &lt;/iframe&gt; at the end. Copy your selection.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/qWBcm4kaPFo"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33673" src="http://www.roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/YouTube-Embed.jpg" alt="YouTube Embed" width="625" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Next, open your edit post or edit page screen and click the text tab above the formatting toolbar. This tab displays your content in its raw HTML form. Put your cursor where you want the embedded content to appear and paste in the code you just copied.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33674" src="http://www.roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Text-Editor.jpg" alt="Text Editor" width="625" height="200" /></p>
<p>Finally, make sure to click the save draft or blue update button to make sure your changes are saved. Now you can switch back to the Visual tab. There should be a yellow box in place of the embed code like the one in the screenshot below. This tells you WordPress has recognized your embed code and saved it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33675" title="Embedded Video" src="http://www.roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Embedded-Video.jpg" alt="Embedded Video" width="625" height="300" /></p>
<h2>Can I upload my own videos directly into WordPress?</h2>
<p>If you prefer not to use a service like YouTube for your own videos, the next best option is to host them yourself. You can upload videos to WordPress and add them to your pages just like other media. However,  I do not recommend this approach for small business websites.</p>
<p>Depending on your website hosting package, you have a certain amount of disk space and a certain quantity of data you&#8217;re allowed to transfer. Video and audio files require a lot of disk space to store and will consume a lot of your data allowance. Unless you&#8217;re prepared to pay for premium hosting service, we recommend hosting multimedia on third-party service like YouTube.</p>
<p>Whether you want to make people laugh, tap their feet or take notes, you don&#8217;t need to code to put video on your website. You just have to be comfortable sharing.</p>

You get to know your customers better and you have the opportunity to increase brand awareness. But sometimes things go wrong and you&#8217;re dealing with complaints or issues with a competitor. Before social media, all of that would have been handled privately. Now you&#8217;re left with tough decisions on how to deal with it publicly. A few recent events highlight how there&#8217;s a wrong way and a right way to handle business on social media.</p>
<p>In one case, two craft brewers tried to hash out their differences online. After a year of negotiations over similar logos, West Sixth took to the Internet to vent about Magic Hat. West Sixth created an entire page on their website dedicated to the issue. &#8220;Stop corporate bullying,&#8221; they cried, but their attempt to rally their fans just left a bad taste in beer drinkers&#8217; mouths. It was a no-win situation and both breweries looked like jerks. In the end, the conflict wasn&#8217;t resolved over social media, it was handled in court, with lawyers.</p>
<p>Not all corporate venting on social media is bad, though. Online magazine Persephone was sued for image copyright infringement along with 70 other defendants. The cost to settle plus legal fees was more than Persephone could afford so they asked for help from their fans on social media. Readers rallied behind them and they were able to raise the money to cover to settle the suit.</p>
<p>When a business owner chooses to air their problems on social media sites, they run the risk of alienating their fans or rallying them. The difference is in what you want your customers to do.</p>
<p>For the small brewery, they were using social media to vent frustration publicly, but their call to action was worthless. You want your fans to drink more of your beer and boycott your competitor. This call to action accomplishes nothing. West Sixth came off looking unprofessional and junior league.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-33632" src="http://www.roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/No-More-Magic-Hat.png" alt="No More Magic Hat" width="574" height="304" /><br />
In Persephone’s case, they had a simple call to action: Give them money to fight the case. Their readers knew exactly what was expected of them and how they could help. The tactic worked and they wrote about their experiences and used them to educate bloggers about the dangers of copyright infringement.

<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s okay to use social media to show off the human side of your business. But just like you don&#8217;t share everything you do with your next-door neighbor, sometimes it&#8217;s better not to share everything with your fans.</p>

<p>It is easy for me to be passionate about Roundpeg. Life at the little white house is exactly what I hoped it would be. Every day I get to do work I love surrounded by people with whom I enjoy working. Personally, I hope they will share my passion for what we do, because it&#8217;s energizing to be around passionate people. As a business owner, I count on their passion, because it&#8217;s critical to our success.</p>
<p>Every day, the team is visible to the business community in person, on social media and through conversations with individual clients. If they don&#8217;t share the passion, sooner or later it is obvious to everyone. My challenge is fueling that passion. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p><strong>Encourage people to really contribute to the organization.</strong> When you hire smart people, be prepared for them to have opinions and ideas which are different from yours. If you create an environment where they can openly share their thoughts and see their ideas put into action, they are likely to be vested in the outcome. This doesn&#8217;t mean you have to agree to everything they suggest, but you need to be willing to listen and consider that you may not have the best answer.</p>
<p><strong>Match people&#8217;s skills to the work you ask them to do.</strong> Every job contains a mixture of interesting tasks and tedious stuff. As you construct jobs, be sure they contain a healthy mix of both. Then hire the right person for the job. As we interview candidates, I want to hire people who <strong><em>really</em> </strong>want to do that job. I watch the body language of the candidate and the words they choose after I describe an assignment. The phrase <em>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind doing that&#8221;</em> is a sure sign they don&#8217;t have passion for the tasks.</p>
<p>Robby Slaughter describes this as <a href="http://www.accelawork.com/employee-passion-employer/">passion about the work</a> when people keep their skills fresh, stay current on industry trends and are willing to invest in tools even if they aren&#8217;t being paid to do so. When you find people who have a passion for their craft, investing in conferences, continuing education programs and tools to expand their skills will make them as passionate about the company as they are about the work.</p>
<p><strong>Reward their passion</strong>. There are lots of studies which say compensation is not the primary motivator as people. It may not be the primary motivator, but it is important. No matter how much people love what they do, if they can&#8217;t pay their bills or they have to work a second job to make ends meet, it is hard to stay passionate. This is a challenge for most small business owners. It is scary to invest in high salaries if your business cycles up and down. To keep people engaged, you need to be creative. Be willing to give employees a bonus when things are going well, and be open to ideas when business is off. These same smart people may have some interesting cost-saving and revenue-generating ideas to help you avoid the valleys in your business cycle.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop at the check; offer non-cash rewards too. For many, many people, being able to adjust their schedule to spend more time with their family or longer hours to enjoy a three-day weekend is worth more than cash. If your typical office dress code is business attire, let people earn a casual Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Foster relationships.</strong> People hate to disappoint those they care about. That level of commitment between team members doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. You need to build time into your routines for people to simply enjoy each other&#8217;s company, get to know each other, share common experiences. Taking a team offsite for a half day can be expensive, but it is invaluable to help accelerate the building of relationships which will make people passionate about their team members and the company.</p>
<p>I suppose you can run a profitable business without passion, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to. Every day, along with all the things I do for clients, part of my job is adding a little fuel to the passion flames at Roundpeg.</p>

I recently had the chance to attend and speak at the<a title="Beer Bloggers Conference" href="http://beerbloggersconference.org/" target="_blank"> Beer Bloggers Conference</a> held in Boston. I spoke to the group of bloggers and industry professionals about how they can leverage social media to build a community and drive traffic to their sites. It&#8217;s a presentation that works no matter what industry you&#8217;re in, since the underlying message is that it&#8217;s all about the content.</p>
<p>What really hit home for me while meeting other beer bloggers was how much craft brewers have in common with small business owners of all kinds. There&#8217;s an intense challenge to be heard when customers are overwhelmed with choices is especially challenging in the craft beer industry, since more than 1,000 new craft breweries will open this year. Throw in alcohol laws, large international conglomerates and the typical challenges small business owners face and it&#8217;s hard to believe craft beer is a thriving industry.</p>
<p>Despite this tough competition, I heard over and over that breweries can&#8217;t keep up with demand. Part of the success of the craft beer industry comes from the Internet &#8211; review sites, bloggers and social media all help fuel the growth, but the majority of the success comes from commitment to quality and commitment to community which can translate to any small business owner.</p>
<p>The commitment to quality doesn&#8217;t apply to just the final product. It starts with every small and large decision you make: hiring quality people, using quality materials, creating quality marketing to get your name out there. Add it all up and you&#8217;ve created something that your customers want and will share with others.</p>
<p>I also noticed the commitment to community. Breweries are creating relationships in the community by donating their time, resources and when appropriate, product. One of the largest cider companies in the country shared how they volunteered at their local town&#8217;s PTA bingo fundraiser. Locally, our breweries have partnerships with community groups and host events that have nothing to do with beer at all. It builds awareness for your name with people who may not know who you are or what you do.</p>
<p>Small business owners are obviously passionate about what they do, otherwise they would have given up long ago. The passion to help people, the commitment to creating a quality product and being active in the community are what helps your business stand out in the crowd. From brewing beer to providing home improvement services, the lessons are the same.</p>

<p>The Roundpeg office has a <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com">BuzzFeed </a>addiction. At regular intervals throughout the day, you&#8217;ll hear, &#8220;Dude, did you read &#8216;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/people-who-should-not-be-allowed-in-public">38 People Who Should Not Be Allowed to Use The Internet</a>&#8216;?&#8221; The posts are as addictive as potato chips: You pop one interesting factoid or cat gif after another. They serve as a mental break without actually taking much mental power. Most articles are &#8220;listicles,&#8221; or numbered lists with a small amount of supporting content and often a picture or gif. That format makes them fast and easy to read, which is exactly what the Internet wants. It&#8217;s because of this appeal that BuzzFeed has become favored over sites that dish up similar kinds of stories in longer packages, like <a href="http://www.Cracked.com">Cracked.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Scanning: The Secret to Success</h2>
<p>BuzzFeed succeeds in today&#8217;s ADD age because it&#8217;s highly scannable. People easily hop around, browsing content which applies to them and skipping what doesn&#8217;t. So while we&#8217;re not suggesting you stick animal gifs into every blog post, there are some clever takeaways you can learn from even the dumbest BuzzFeed article.</p>
<h3>Start with a Clear Title</h3>
<p>Some people try to be too tricksy with their headlines, but BuzzFeed is about as literal as it can get. When you click on &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/leonoraepstein/14-things-you-didnt-know-about-labyrinth">14 Things You Didn&#8217;t Know About Labyrin</a><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/leonoraepstein/14-things-you-didnt-know-about-labyrinth">th</a>,&#8221; you&#8217;re going to get 14 bites of information on Muppets, David Bowie and how they did those cool juggling stunts. There are no games, no lies. By the time people click on the article, they already know if it&#8217;s something they want to read or not.</p>
<h3>Lists Are Your Friends</h3>
<p>Using numbered lists are a huge cliche in blog posts, but you know what? They work, darnit. Not everything should be a numbered list, but every now and then, throw one in. Chances are it&#8217;ll get you big results.</p>
<h3>No List? Use Headings</h3>
<p>For this post, I debated on using a list, but decided it wasn&#8217;t a linear progression or a ranking. For me, that meant opting for these big, chunky headlines breaking up the text. Bullets are also a great option, but headings allow people to skim to what interests them and skip what doesn&#8217;t. As long as they walk away with one worthwhile bit of information, you&#8217;ve done your job.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Fear the Niche</h2>
<p><strong></strong>Some BuzzFeed posts, like &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexnaidus/childhood-feelings-you-wish-you-could-get-back">22 Childhood Feelings You Wish You Could Get Back</a>,&#8221; are massively broad in terms of appeal. After all, everyone was a kid at some point or other. Others, like &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/brooklynejewel/25-signs-you-went-to-ucla-in-the-agood-old-daysa-csju">25 Signs You Went to UCLA in the Good Old Days</a>,&#8221; are much narrower, yet that post still garnered more than 70,000 views. If you target one particular community and nail their hopes, dreams and concerns, you&#8217;ll have success, even if it&#8217;s small.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Overstay Your Welcome</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve said what you need to say, stop talking.</p>

The Internet makes everything so easy, you can probably make your own small business website without coding anything, right? So, why bother hiring one at all? I&#8217;ve got a few good reasons for you. You&#8217;re better off hiring a web designer if you&#8217;re affected by at least one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have the time.</li>
<li>You don’t have the skills.</li>
<li>You need a fresh perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound anything like you? With a cornucopia of no-code website builders and free resources online, it&#8217;s not the tools holding you back. It&#8217;s the intangibles you&#8217;re missing.</p>
<h2>You don&#8217;t have the time</h2>
<p>What would you rather be doing right now? Watching your favorite TV show? Sippin&#8217; on an icy beverage? Doing your actual job instead of reading blog posts and documentation? Unless you&#8217;re a marketing or web design company, making websites is not your business. Busy yourself with the activities you&#8217;re passionate about and nothing less.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re passionate about your business, one of those activities might be hiring and working with a web designer. You could have the time to make decisions about your website and engage with the web design process, sure. But you don&#8217;t have time to execute those decisions. Why? Because you have day-to-day tasks in the business you&#8217;re truly passionate about. Do those things. Hire a web designer to help you finish web design tasks.</p>
<h2>You don&#8217;t have the skills</h2>
<p>Quality web design is not code-free or easy for the novice, I don&#8217;t care what Wix or GoDaddy says. Easy website builders just can&#8217;t deliver a long-term solution. You&#8217;ll spend a couple of hours on it after the &#8220;one-click&#8221; setup, only to grow out of a little three-page site in a month. What you should be trying for is a professional, expandable, website that will grow with your business.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of people with the expertise you need to move forward. Hire a web designer to help you build a solid foundation for growth.</p>
<h2>You need a fresh perspective</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have the skills and you have the time. You can probably do a lot for your business online by yourself. Let&#8217;s also say you&#8217;re truly passionate about your business and take a hand in every aspect of its running. Here&#8217;s where you might need to take a step back in order to effectively, efficiently work on a new web design. The same passion that makes you a good business owner could stymie your decision making on a project that affects you so closely.</p>
<p>Ever tried to pick paint colors or drapes for your home? Remember getting your first (or second) logo? Personal biases and emotional responses can muddy decisions that should be based in facts and strategy. Take yourself out of the equation and hire someone to look at your business with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>Are there any situations when you should wait to hire a web designer? <a title="3 Reasons Not to Hire a Web Designer" href="http://www.roundpeg.biz/2013/08/reasons-not-to-hire-a-web-designer/" target="_blank">Definitely</a>. But if you&#8217;re ready, don&#8217;t delay. The Internet&#8217;s only getting bigger and better. You want to be a part of this.</p>
<p>Wondering where to find a web designer? Start with a Google search in your area. Anyone in marketing and web design will have paid close attention to their search ranking to make sure you find them near the top of that list. Or ask around in your networking circle to see what other people are doing.</p>

<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Ai Weiwei&#8217;s exhibit at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Unfortunately, the exhibit has now closed, but it was worth seeing. As you might know, Ai&#8217;s a very controversial artist, mainly focused on human rights and social change. For some reason, it struck me to take pictures of his work, and the guards encouraged it is a part of the exhibition because he wants to get the word out about the meaning of his work.</p>
<p>All of his artwork is created with a purpose and a message. Throughout school, I learned that that was what I needed to do as a graphic designer. When I&#8217;m creating a logo or designing another piece of marketing collateral, it&#8217;s not about simply &#8221;making something pretty,&#8221; but about the message that is being conveyed to its audience. It has a purpose, just like Ai&#8217;s art does. It&#8217;s about communicating the message appropriately and understandably. In order to do that, there are a variety of ways. From the typeface chosen to the colors used, even the imagery and shapes within the designs all has a purpose. Everything subconsciously gives off a meaning. It may differ from one person to the next, but the majority of the meaning of the image will remain. So what&#8217;s the main message people will get from your design? That&#8217;s what matters and that&#8217;s what needs to be demonstrated to your audience.</p>
<p>This being said, the thinking behind a design has to also fall in line with the messaging of other marketing techniques around it. Copy for a brochure can&#8217;t sound playful while the design looks dark and gloomy. No, they have to run alongside each other. In school, it was always one person writing and doing everything. Here at Roundpeg, it&#8217;s a mixture of everyone working together to get the same messaging across all platforms. This means being consistent with all marketing tactics, design included, and the easiest way to stay consistent with designing is to have a brand sheet and guidelines near for quick reference.</p>
<p>Why is this important? In order for your audience to digest the message, it needs to be consistent and understandable. Giving it meaning makes it even stronger.

<p>You are probably familiar with the serenity prayer. You may have even invoked it once or twice in your life. While you&#8217;re waiting for divine intervention in your business, there is a simple tool you can use to sort out the things you can and can&#8217;t change. More importantly, you can start formulating strategies and action plans to deal with your challenges.</p>
<h1>The S.W.O.T. Matrix</h1>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-33511 alignright" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" src="http://www.roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SWOTMatrix_Cover_Icon-150x150.jpg" alt="SWOTMatrix_Cover_Icon" width="150" height="150" />This tool takes its name from the primary internal and external factors which can impact your business success, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Internal Factors: Strengths and Weaknesses</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">External Factors: Opportunities and Threats</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">An action plan to clarify which </span></span>opportunities<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> you will purse, which challenges you will address and how. </span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Look Inside: Find your Strengths and Weaknesses.</h2>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"></strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Your strengths are the characteristics of your business or product which give you a </span></span>competitive<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 19px;"> advantage. This may be a unique talent or skill set of one of your employees, elements of your </span>fulfillment<span style="line-height: 19px;"> process, pricing, delivery or customer service. These are the </span>characteristics<span style="line-height: 19px;"> which answer the </span>question, &#8220;<span style="line-height: 19px;"> Why should I buy from you?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p>Be honest about your weaknesses. T<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">here are things your customers value that you don&#8217;t do well or at all. Acknowledging a weakness give you a starting point for change. If you are missing a critical skill, take a course or find someone you can outsource the project to. If there is something wrong with your process which turns potential customers away or leaves them dissatisfied, change it. </span></p>
<p>The internal factors, your strengths and weaknesses, are the things you can change, but only if you know what they are. Not sure if you have a complete picture of your strengths and weaknesses? Ask customers why they do business with you, and prospects who went elsewhere why they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<h2>Look Outside for Opportunities and Threats</h2>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"></strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">These are the things in the larger business community which will impact your business. You can&#8217;t change them, but you can decide how you want to react. Natural disasters,  economic shifts, changes in tax code or regulations governing your industry are all examples of things which could positively or negatively impact your future sales. Also in this category are things like the  emergence of a new competing product, service or company, or management changes at key clients.</span></p>
<h2>Putting the Pieces Together to Build a Plan</h2>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is not to simply list theses elements, but to use this information as a starting point for your action plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">How can you use your strengths to overcome threats in your market? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">What can you do to compensate for your weaknesses or eliminate them completely so you can take advantage of new opportunities? </span></li>
<li>As  shifts occur in the marketplace, what actions will you take to stay one step ahead?</li>
</ul>
<h2>S.W.O.T. Again and Again</h2>
<p>The market continues to change. Competitors come and go, and so do employees and clients. A S.W.O.T Matrix is a snapshot in time. You should review your S.W.O.T every six months, adjusting your strategies and tactics to match the new picture of your company and environment.</p>
