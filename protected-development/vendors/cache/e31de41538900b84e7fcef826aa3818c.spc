I didn&rsquo;t follow the band or know a lot about them, just that someone wanted to live with a woman named Lorelei, and that I could almost smell the sea as we sailed away together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is real music,&rdquo; Mom would tell me between fist pumps and head bobs.</p>
<p>Styx played the Marsh Free Stage at the <a title="State Fair photos" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/PhotoPages/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=141469">Indiana State Fair</a> last night, and naturally Mom and I were there, surrounded by several generations of fans. The 40-year-old band took the stage wearing the kind of long hair and tight pants that were big in the &rsquo;70s. The audience cheered, clapped, fist-pumped, and belted out the words to old classics like &ldquo;Blue Collar Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Grand Illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of you weren&rsquo;t around when we first started,&rdquo; guitarist Tommy Shaw said to the crowd. Some clearly were: One man held a sign that said he had been to 40 Styx concerts. Chuck Panozzo, the original, 65-year-old bass player, made a guest appearance for &ldquo;Fooling Yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These guys may be getting older, but they played for two hours&mdash;with an encore. And they sounded exactly like the greatest-hits album that blared through the speakers as we sped down the highway on our way to the show.</p>

More than 160 young Hoosiers (ranging in age from 6 to 21) had previously sent in tapes of their finest vocal performances for a chance to battle at the State Fair&rsquo;s rendition of <em>American Idol</em>, its first-ever Vocal Throwdown, and the army of vocalists was then winnowed to 10 finalists across Youth and Junior divisions.</p>
<p>Two Greenwood singers in a band namd South Six 5 awed the three-panel judge on Saturday with an original song called &ldquo;Every Second of the Day.&rdquo; The 13-year-old pair, Jacob Bates and Andrew Butcher, took home the Youth Division gold after singing of love, a milestone in life that I'm unsure they have yet met. And by gold, I mean that they seized a $500 cash prize, a trophy, and bragging rights. And leave it to a Naptown native to really bring the Indiana heat (pun intended): 17-year-old Ali Orebaugh&rsquo;s Christina Aguilera&ndash;esque voice stole the show, as she sang Etta James&rsquo; &ldquo;At Last&rdquo; to claim the Junior division award.</p>
<p>Hoosiers never let their guests leave empty handed. Second-place winners left with $250 awards, and third-place finishers were given $100.</p>
<p>Here is Orebaugh's performance of "At Last":</p>

<p><span class="title"><br />Sharks are all the rage</span> this week in light of Discovery Channel's annual <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/shark-week" target="_blank">Shark Week</a>, a hypervisual bonanza of blood peppered with some feel-good accounts and less volatile documentaries (and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57597324-93/shark-week-show-gets-panned-for-being-a-fake-documentary/" target="_blank">pseudo-documentaries?</a>) aimed at injecting a sizable dose of terror into viewers' couch-sitting noggins. Then there's the viral web phenomenon of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt5rBfNucc" target="_blank">Roomba-cruising cat in a shark costume</a> and the sad revelation of a <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/07/shark-week-dead-shark-found-in-nyc-subway-car/" target="_blank">dead shark's carcass planted</a> on a New York City subway train.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, the human race has a preoccupation with the creature. This is nothing new, as we've been alternately paralyzed and fascinated by sharks since the landmark film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/" target="_blank"><em>Jaws </em></a>in 1975, the world's first true blockbuster movie. And I am among those who can't take their eyes off the carnage&mdash;and the beauty&mdash;of sharks. I actually wasn't even allowed to watch <em>Jaws </em>until a certain age, raised in a home where my then-pastor father time and again, when we wanted to see a <em>Jaws</em>- or <em>Scream</em>-type flick, admonished my young brothers and me that "we are not made to live in fear."</p>
<p><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/CircleCitizen/2013/GreatWhiteSharkPoster.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="445" />Enter <a href="http://greatwhiteshark3d.com/" target="_blank"><em>Great White Shark</em></a>. This smartly paced 3D documentary experience now showing at the Indiana State Museum comes across as a 40-minute visual love letter to <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>, "the predator we love to fear." It's narrated by English actor Bill Nighy (<em>Love Actually</em>, <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>, <em>Underworld</em>), who lends a stately calm to the proceedings. As much as he can, anyway, based on the creative introductory credits and amazing footage of these graceful, sleek animals flipping and leaping out of the water.</p>
<p>If I have any criticism of the film, it's that I wished for a longer run time. However, at its current length, it likely has a far better opportunity to educate today's ADD-addled youth, and many of them made up the audience with whom I took in the film.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/GAttack/World.htm" target="_blank">International Shark Attack File</a> at the Florida Museum of Natural History, unprovoked shark attacks on human in the past 431 years (through 2011) have resulted in just 471 deaths. As <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/08/international-shark-week/" target="_blank">Wired.com</a> has it, "Only about 100 attacks, unprovoked or provoked, are reported every year, which works out to one shark attack for every million sharks killed." Yea, as <em>Great White Shark </em>tells us, the GWS and its related species are themselves in danger, a far cry from what silly thrillers the likes of <em>Deep Blue Sea </em>have told us. (Dare I even mention <em>Sharknado</em>?)</p>
<p>"Live every week like it's Shark Week," said Tracy Morgan's character on the erstwhile NBC sitcom <em>30 Rock</em>. Indeed, I say&mdash;and live without fear.</p>

And yet so many of our Greatest Generation have never seen the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., have never traced the gold stars representing the brethren who fell in battle with their fingertips.</p>
<p>Last September, director Grant Thompson organized the first <a href="http://www.indyhonorflight.org/" target="_blank">Indy Honor Flight</a> out of Indianapolis, carrying around 80 veterans to Washington for free. The non-profit program allows them to see this tribute to their service and sacrifice before it is too late&mdash;though that time has passed for my grandfathers.</p>
<p>Ray Steele Sr. died in Trenton, Georgia, in 1978. He was only 53. He was lucky he didn&rsquo;t die more than three decades earlier in Europe, when he fought in the Battle of the Bulge and saw the sickening Dachau concentration camp when it was liberated. He was my grandfather, Papa Bear&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t quite 7 when he passed away.</p>
<p>Raymond Lee Steele was my other grandfather (no Southern jokes, please&mdash;two different sets of Steeles, I promise). He died in 1987, at 61 years old. He could&rsquo;ve died more than four decades prior, serving in the Navy in the Pacific Theater.</p>
<p>Roy Wallin died in Rising Fawn, Georgia, in 2007. He was 89. By all rights, he should have died more than 60 years earlier when his Army unit was ambushed in the Philippines. He was awarded the Bronze Star&mdash;it came just a few years before he died, better late than never. Roy was my step-grandfather.</p>
<div class="image_align_left" style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000; padding: 1.5em 3em; margin-bottom: 1em;">I hope that running 200 miles between now and the next Indy Honor Flight on September 7 will help raise awareness&mdash;and a few dollars, through your donations&mdash;to help get another veteran to Washington.</div>
<p>These three men never saw the World War II Memorial because it took whomever is in charge of those things too long to build it; it just opened in 2004, nearly 60 years from the close of the war. But now I have a chance to raise money to send other heroes on the trip my grandfathers never got to take.</p>
<p>Through<a href="http://www.wibc.com/RunWithRay/" target="_blank"> &ldquo;Run with Ray,&rdquo;</a> I&rsquo;m raising money for the Honor Flight. I will never be as brave as these Hoosiers were, so I hope that running 200 miles between now and the next Indy Honor Flight on September 7 will help raise awareness&mdash;and a few dollars, through your donations&mdash;to help get another veteran to Washington. I also hope running will honor the memory of my grandfathers, for whom I would have given anything for the chance to accompany on such a flight.</p>
<p>It costs $450 to send one veteran on the flight. Even if you have just a few bucks to spare, the Indy Honor Flight sure could use them. You can donate (tax deductible!) to Run with Ray at <a href="http://www.wibc.com/RunWithRay/" target="_blank">wibc.com/RunWithRay</a>. Please designate your donations as being for Run With Ray for the Indy Honor Flight under the PayPal special instructions. Let's let our remaining WWII veterans know that we haven&rsquo;t forgotten what they went through to give us the lives we have.<br /><br /></p>

Their goal: bringing music and visual art to the Indy metro community. Their props: 20 donated pianos and a list of unusual art mediums. Through August 18, you can spot these decorative pianos placed throughout Indianapolis and Carmel.</p>
<p>Perhaps the quirkiest of them all is the "Tickled Pink, Tickling the Ivories" piano located on Monument Circle. Annette Marino, a knitting pro who goes by the moniker Stockannette, and the Yarnburners, a group of 14 serious knitters and crocheters from all over Indiana, joined forces to create the &ldquo;piano sweater&rdquo; after hearing of the Women&rsquo;s Fund&rsquo;s efforts. Their final "yarnbombed" product&mdash;with intricately stitched patches, including musical notes and treble clefs&mdash;was rolled out onto the Circle on August 1, joining the brightly painted "Out Loud in the City" piano and the foot-print-covered "Stroll" piano.</p>
<p><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/CircleCitizen/Pianos-Monument-Circle/Stroll-boy-playing.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="335" />Stockannette, who staked out a spot near her piano on August 2 to watch people interact with it, says they seem unsure at first if they&rsquo;re allowed to touch it. But citizens on the Circle have taken a liking to the dolled-up instrument&mdash;one of several located downtown. &ldquo;They see someone play a tune, they come in for a closer look, and play a little something themselves,&rdquo; Stockannette says.</p>
<p><img class="image_align_top_left" title="&quot;Out Loud in the City&quot; piano on Monument Circle (Photo by Jennifer Burnham)" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/CircleCitizen/Pianos-Monument-Circle/OutLoudInCity-2.jpg" alt="&quot;Out Loud in the City&quot; piano on Monument Circle (Photo by Jennifer Burnham)" width="250" height="335" />The reaction from youngsters was most heartwarming. During a debut of all the pianos in one place prior to their public rollout, a toddler told Stockannette, &ldquo;Thank you for making this pretty piano.&rdquo; For now, the young Hoosier&rsquo;s response to the Yarnburners' masterpiece serves as hope for those who might fear that music, and the arts in general, are fading from our community.<br /><br /></p>

Indeed, that's exactly what I saw. However, that was not the majority of the turnout. The crowd was a completely mixed bag. The National appeals to a range of music fans, from those stubborn listeners who refuse to come up from the underground indie-rock scene all the way to the modern mainstream listeners hoping to cleanse their aural palates.</p>
<p>Regardless, all National fans know what to expect when spinning one of their records&mdash;excellent musicianship accompanied by natural warm tones and a somber but sweet vocal delivery. The majority of these songs provide mellow-rock moodiness that begs for a beer and a listening party with friends. While all of that held true for this live show, it was also amped up a significant notch.</p>
<p>The concert kicked off with the brooding metaphors in "I Should Live in Salt," also the first track on The National's newest record, <em>Trouble Will Find Me</em>. Crowd favorite "Bloodbuzz Ohio" started just two songs later, and then the room's energy went from chill to full-on rock show. Frontman Matt Berninger, he of the wine-drenched baritone, literally screamed with emotion through tracks such as "Sea Of Love" and "Graceless." All of the rockier songs made for marriages of loud guitars, commanding vocals, gleeful crowds, and a stunning light show. But the performance never crossed the line into being over the top. Everything was well managed and felt right, including the small brass section. Generally, this is well-mannered rock for the masses.</p>
<p>Softer songs still found their place throughout, as the straightforward and guitar-inviting &ldquo;I Need My Girl&rdquo; drew all lovers' attention in the theater, while the end of the encore was a real treat. The National played the reflective &ldquo;Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks&rdquo; completely unplugged as the captive crowd sang along to every word.</p>
<p>The National is one of the biggest indie-rock acts in the industry, to the wonder of no one who took in this performance. Bespectacled at 42 years old, Berninger doesn&rsquo;t need to jump around on stage to own an audience's attention. Instead, he continually paces back and forth with a demanding vibe. It felt as though he would truly put himself right back in the moment of every track's essence. And as the abstract lighting poured over him repeatedly, it hung a hauntingly beautiful feeling in the room. It felt like you could reach out and touch his raw, emotional persona. It was all so tangible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what music is about, especially when hearing it and seeing it live. Right now, The National is on another level in its genre. What to say? The fawning is deserved.</p>
<p>Highlight of the night: During the encore, Berninger strolled over the backs of theater seats through the crowd as he sang "Mr. November," a song off the band's 2005 breakthrough <em>Alligator</em>. Or perhaps the true highlight arrived when he handed a bottle of wine to a couple in the front row. Always tasteful, these guys.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/08/05/review-the-national-rocks-murat-theatre";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/08/05/review-the-national-rocks-murat-theatre";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Mon, 05 Aug 2013 21:45:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"James Layne";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"Q&amp;A: Karmin, Soon to Play the Indiana State Fair";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2080:"<p><span class="title">Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan</span> make up the musical duo Karmin, and released the catchy single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJWJfRAGnHc" target="_blank">&ldquo;Acapella&rdquo;</a> in June.

<p><strong>IM: You were just here with the <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/07/12/spotted-jonas-brothers-on-monument-circle-indianapolis">Jonas Brothers</a> last month. What was that like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nick Noonan:</strong> It was only like the second or third night of the tour, so it was pretty early on. But clearly, it was awesome.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: Did you explore Indy at all while you were here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NN:</strong> We did! We went downtown to eat some froyo and got our shopping on at Circle Centre.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: What was your favorite part of downtown?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amy Heidemann:</strong> The atmosphere here. We were actually just talking about that last night. Indy feels like a big city, but it isn&rsquo;t that big.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: Anything weird about playing a rural event like the Indiana State Fair?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NN:</strong> No, it feels like we&rsquo;re back home. Amy came from a small town in Nebraska, and I came from a small town in Maine. Both towns have populations under 8,000.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: You&rsquo;re opening for bands like STYX. Are you a fan?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AH:</strong> Oh yeah! It&rsquo;s an honor.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: Have you been to a lot of state fairs?</strong></p>
<p>AH: We have, but they all have a different vibe. The one thing they all share is great food stands.

<p class="FreeForm">There was, of course, the Guinness International Champions Cup match between global soccer titans Internazionale, of Italy's Serie A league, and Chelsea FC, of the English Premier League.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="FreeForm">That contest saw the two clubs racing across 100,000 feet of Kentucky bluegrass sod, laid over the stadium&rsquo;s usual FieldTurf days before the match&mdash;a contest that Chelsea handily won, slotting two goals in the first half. (At a postgame press conference, Inter's coach, Walter Mazzarri, remarked through a translator: "The stadium is beautiful; the field a little less.")</p>
<p class="FreeForm">The second contest, though, wasn&rsquo;t confined to the venue. Instead, it played out among throngs of fans before the game, in pubs such as the Claddagh ("We're at capacity," employees stationed outside its doors told those hoping to grab a pre-match drink), and on Georgia Street, where revelers at a pre-game street party f&ecirc;ted what felt like&nbsp;Indy's coming out as the nation's newest soccer town.</p>
<p class="FreeForm">It was a contest waged by many, but spearheaded by Indy Eleven, the city's new professional soccer club in <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/hoosierfeatures/2013/07/29/missed-goals-indiana-soccer-teams-that-folded">a long line of past failures</a>, for the hearts and minds of potential supporters&mdash;and converts to the Beautiful Game&mdash;ahead of their debut NASL season in 2014.</p>
<p class="FreeForm">And, it seems, it was a contest they also handily won: Even veteran <em>Indianapolis Star</em> sports columnist Bob Kravitz, once a naysayer about the sport's prospects here, seemed to recant:</p>
<p class="FreeForm">"Warning to anti-soccer curmudgeons (and I was one myself)," Kravitz tweeted during the game. "I'm writing a positive column on the future of soccer in Indy."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="FreeForm">Indeed, Indy Eleven officials seemed to approach last night's event as a sort of a test-run for their marketing apparatus. The team&rsquo;s new coach Juergen Sommer comfortably rapped with a scrum of reporters shortly before kickoff last night, and said he was encouraged by the night&rsquo;s turnout. (Go to the top of the page for audio from Sommer's interview.) <img style="float: right; margin: 5px;" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/CircleCitizen/2013/sommer.jpg" alt="Juergen Sommer" width="153" height="203" /></p>
<p class="FreeForm">Dozens of Indy Eleven volunteers fanned out across the stadium before the game, placing promotional postcards in seats. And right before kickoff, there was Indiana Gov. Mike Pence down on the field, saying a few words alongside Ersal Ozdemir, the team&rsquo;s owner.</p>
<p class="FreeForm">But it was more than a test run. Indy Eleven actually had "skin in the game," says John Koluder, the team&rsquo;s director of public relations, meaning they could see some financial incentives tied to the match's success, as one of the event&rsquo;s promoters. What that meant in real terms was unclear (and Peter Wilt says <a href="http://www.ibj.com/the-score-2013-07-31-more-than-40000-fans-international-media-throng-to-attend-soccer-game/PARAMS/post/42758">the event wasn&rsquo;t about making money</a>, but building the game).</p>
<p class="FreeForm">What stuck this reporter, though, is the organization's marketing muscle. The fledgling club managed to land a vaunted international fixture, stage-managed a globally televised sporting event, and seamlessly orchestrated a post-game press conference (that was partly in Italian, no less).</p>
<p class="FreeForm">Some are already <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/01/mls-expansion-four-teams-2020-24">speculating</a> that Indy could be a contender for one of the four expected Major League Soccer expansion teams set to launch by 2020.</p>
<p class="FreeForm">But even if that doesn&rsquo;t happen&mdash;and Sommer downplayed the possibility last night, saying he was focused on fielding a quality side next year&mdash;even if only for one night in August, soccer scored big in Indianapolis.</p>

The news broke Wednesday that Weiner and Leathers, a 23-year-old reportedly living in Princeton, Ind., exchanged tawdry texts in 2012, and the beleaguered politician used the alias "Carlos Danger." (It's been reported that Leathers was a blogger for Indiana Progressive Liberals, but the group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IndianaProgressives/posts/576037045772203" target="_blank">refuted that claim</a> on its Facebook page.) Weiner confirmed this latest accusation, and his mayoral opponents immediately called for him to drop out of the race. But some people aren't taking the story so seriously. Indy-based writer Rob Annis <a href="http://www.gadling.com/2013/07/25/weiner-sexts-airline-fare-sale-spirit/" target="_blank">blogged</a> on AOL-owned Gadling, a travel site, that Sprint Airlines is running a sale called "The Weiner Rises Again," accompanied by a graphic of a hot-dog mascot. The post quickly topped Gadling's most-popular list. Sprint's sale ends today&mdash;but unfortunately for Leathers, the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/weiner-downplays-pressure-quit-race-article-1.1407544" target="_blank">media's interest in her private life</a> probably won't.</p>

As a panel of five seated women (dressed in black) recite vignettes, the audience gets a 360-degree experience as artwork dotting the walls is incorporated into their stories.</p>
<p>Chopped up into 27 scenes (but still running just 1 hour, 45 minutes), the show&rsquo;s main storyline of &ldquo;Gingy&rdquo; is read by Gayle Steigerwald. An ensemble of Cindy Phillips, Lori Raffel, Sara Riemen, and Milicent Wright add to Gingy&rsquo;s scenes, and count anecdotes of their own.</p>
<p>Laugh-out-loud situations and dialogue touch on the complexities of when to wear white (&ldquo;Just never wear white&rdquo;), the perplexity of the sleeveless turtleneck (&ldquo;Are you hot or are you cold? Make up your mind!&rdquo;), and the dreaded sale rack as a teen (&ldquo;You bought me an outfit for my birthday on <em>sale</em>?&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Other stories weren&rsquo;t so lighthearted, as issues of rape, divorce, and breast cancer were revealed as the women remembered what they&rsquo;d worn during these particularly poignant moments in their lives.</p>
<p>A guy&rsquo;s guy probably won&rsquo;t appreciate the brilliance of bringing the obvious frustrations of the female experience to light, but this show is appropriate for women of all ages and would make for a great girls&rsquo; night out.</p>
<p>As the ladies told their tales, it sometimes seemed as though the audience was watching a live read-through or a rehearsal. At other moments, the timing of rapid-fire dialogue was spot on. Opening night is funny that way, and these talented women are sure to find their rhythm with each other and the audience throughout the run.</p>
<p>Arrive early, and grab a seat in the middle of the room to get the very best view of this performance.</p>
<p><em><br />The show's run has been extended: September 5&ndash;8 and 12&ndash;15. Thurs. 7 p.m., Fri. and Sat. 8 p.m., Sun. 2 p.m. $28 for adults; $18 for those 21 and under.

<p><em>July 24, 4:15 p.m., at the Indianapolis Museum of Art<br /></em></p>
<p>Frey met Indianapolis artist Kipp Normand at a wedding where Frey was the photographer and Normand was in the wedding party. From there, they ran into each other often enough that they became friends. Normand, known to collect objects and make art from them, has a studio at the Harrison Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want people to walk away from this film and have a respect for Kipp as an artist," says Frey. "I want them to have a respect for the past. Kipp's artwork takes lowly and rejected objects from the past and gives them a new life and context by connecting them to a contemporary audience. Hopefully people will get that even if it's subconscious.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>

<p><em>Will be present at the July 24 showing, 4:15 p.m., at the IMA<br /></em></p>
<p>After seeing a short film at his first film festival, Togerson was reminded by the quirky characters of his father and his friend Vic, which gave him the idea to make this movie. &ldquo;At least from my perspective, they're two pretty unusual characters, especially when you get them together and talking about mushrooms,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>While the hunt for <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/dining/articles/2013/04/02/recipe-good-morels" target="_blank">morel mushrooms</a> is something his dad has done in Indiana and beyond for decades&mdash;and continues to do with his grandchildren&mdash;Torgerson says, &ldquo;The movie really ended up being about friends and getting older. &hellip; I have a lot of people tell me they start to think about their moms and dads as they watch the film. &hellip; I hope the film will get people thinking about their good friends and taking time to savor what they love most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The film and I have lots of Indiana connections and so I hoped it could have a screening in the state,&rdquo; he says, adding his friend and Indy-based musician Jeremy Vogt scored the film and wrote an original song that plays during the credits.</p>

<p><em>Will be present at the July 24 showing, 6:15 p.m., at the IMA<br /></em></p>
<p>Sometimes you never know what&mdash;or who&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see at the <a href="http://www.indyfilmfest.org" target="_blank">Indy Film Fest</a>, but this is the film most likely to have a collection of professional Santa impersonators on hand for least one screening, says Peter, a documentary filmmaker who has returned to his home state of Indiana after spending the majority of his career in New Orleans. While he&rsquo;s not sure how many will be there&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Santas are a secretive bunch, y'know?&rdquo;&mdash;he says more than 300 Santas dressed from head to toe came to the premiere in Santa Claus, Ind.</p>
<p>The film was inspired by the story of Jim Yellig, who was Peter&rsquo;s small-town Santa once upon a time, and, as legend has it, is the Santa other performers try to emulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men who portray Santa don't see their role in the way I do," Peter says. "They just want to bring joy to children and adults. The great lengths they sometime go to in order to bring that joy is amazing. I want society to respect what they do, and keep the legend alive for future generations."<br /><br /></p>
<p><span class="title">Philip Paluso</span><strong><em><br /></em>Director of<em><a href="http://indyfilmfest.festivalgenius.com/2013/films/wingsformaggieray_philippaluso_indyfilmfest2013" target="_blank"> Wings for Maggie Ray</a><br /></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong><em>Will be present at July 22 (7 p.m.) and July 26 (3:15 p.m.) showings, both at the IMA<br /></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm kind of a history nut,&rdquo; says Paluso of his subject matter. &ldquo;In early 2008, I read a small article about Indiana aviation legend Margaret Ringenberg in an issue of <em>Indianapolis Monthly</em>. There was a photo of her as a 21-year-old Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) and a few facts about her career. She looked so young, yet so very confident, posing in the cockpit of a North American AT-6, a single engine advanced trainer of the era.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paluso hopes audiences will appreciate the contribution of Ringenberg, a Fort Wayne native, and other female pilots in the Women Airforce who, &ldquo;were the vanguard that eventually made it possible for women to achieve at the highest levels in U.S. military and civilian aviation.&rdquo; For her contributions, Ringenberg was even featured&mdash;getting her own chapter&mdash;in Tom Brokaw&rsquo;s <em>The Greatest Generation</em>.</p>

<p>Will be <em>present at the July 23&nbsp; showing, 3:15 p.m., at the IMA<br /></em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magical place called Slab City near the Salton Sea in California, where the people are just about as far away from civilization as one can get&mdash;and they want it to stay that way. After seeing it for himself, James says he thought it would be the perfect place to film a concert film about an Echo Park band, Manhattan Murder Mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People thought I was completely crazy for wanting to do this,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They would call me crazy then ask how they could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James hopes that audiences will leave this film and realize &ldquo;that it's important to look closer at something that may seem unsettling or even frightening. Stop for just a minute, look around you, ask questions, and look closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indy Film Fest is a homecoming for this Franklin College graduate who would volunteer there and at Heartland Film Festival while in college. &ldquo;It's a huge honor to now be screened at a festival I went to for years as a fan,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p><em>Will be present at July 25 showing, 4:30 p.m., at the IMA.<br /></em></p>
<p>Cohn, a Brooklyn-based filmmaker, screenwriter, and co-director, and Davy Rothbart, creator and editor of <em>FOUND Magazine</em>, were both raised in Ann Arbor, Mich. However, Cohn&rsquo;s parents were from Indiana, so he spent a fair amount of time in the state when he was growing up. After Rothbart saw a <em>New York Times</em> article about a town of about 700 people, home to the Medora Hornets&mdash;a high-school basketball team <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/hoosierfeatures/2012/09/27/game-film-medora" target="_blank">with a flabbergasting losing streak</a> in a state known for its hoops fanaticism&mdash;the pair ecided to make this movie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story of Medora is a very personal story, but also a universal story about underdogs, the value of small-town America, and the small victories in life," says Cohn. "As lifelong friends, documentary junkies and basketball fanatics, the story of Medora was a film we felt we were born to make." He&rsquo;d like audiences to &ldquo;get a sense for the value of small towns, and all that is being lost as these towns continue to fade off the map, in a global economy that has rendered them obsolete. We want people to understand the character, courage, and resiliency of the kids who populate these towns, and be moved by their stories. As one Medora High School teacher says in the film, &lsquo;You don't have to do great things to be a person.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

The breakout album <em>Chariot </em>spawned a mega-hit in "I Don't Want to Be," and follow-up singles "Follow Through," "Chariot," and "Not Over You" (from the album <em>Sweeter</em>). He's a mainstay of pop-music soundtracks for film and TV, and his latest single, "Best I Ever Had" came out on June 18. DeGraw plays <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/hoosierfeatures/2013/06/14/deer-creek-greatest-hits-25th-anniversary" target="_blank">Klipsch Music Center</a> tonight alongside The Script in support of headliner Train. Here are edited excerpts from our phone conversation:<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>IM: You were in Indy recently for a concert on Monument Circle. [The 500 Festival's REV Your Engines concert on April 27.] How did that go?<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>GD: </strong>It went well.</p>
<p><strong>IM: Are you a racing fan?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> Oh, yes.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: Really? Who were you rooting for in the last 500? Tony [Kanaan]?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> I rooted for the guy who introduced me at the concert. You&rsquo;re going to have to look that one up.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: All right, I will. [Answer: IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> Nice guy. Super-nice guy. That was a beautiful night. We played at Monument Circle. Beautiful place. The sound was great. And I&rsquo;ll say I always enjoy myself when in Indianapolis, but it looked like it had undergone some aesthetic improvements since the last time I was in the downtown area.</p>
<p><strong><br />IM: Really? When&rsquo;s the last time you visited?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> It&rsquo;s probably been four to five years since I last visited.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: That&rsquo;s interesting. So have you ever been to a 500 race?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> Nope, I&rsquo;ve never been to one.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: You&rsquo;ve never partied at the track?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> I&rsquo;ve partied at tracks before but not Indy. I&rsquo;ve been up to one in Seneca Lake, New York, before. I&rsquo;ve actually only been to NASCAR races. It&rsquo;s like picking the wrong team right now. But I love racing. I used to go to stock-car racing when I was growing up at the county fair where I grew up. I think in general, guys like cars.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: That&rsquo;s funny. All right, switching gears. Let&rsquo;s talk about your latest hit, &ldquo;Not Over You.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD: </strong>Well, I wrote that song with a friend of mine named Ryan Tedder. He&rsquo;s a singer for OneRepublic.<strong> </strong>I think Ryan is a special writer. He has a special talent. He&rsquo;s a special producer.<strong> </strong>We were out at his place in Denver, and we were going over some bits and pieces of a song. He played the piano a bit, and I was like, yeah, we can definitely start there. We started there, and then ended up with the song. We felt like we had a contender for a first single and the rest was a series of lucky strokes that made it a hit. You know every artist hopes fans will connect with their songs because it really changes your career. I really hadn&rsquo;t had a hit prior to that song for years.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: Were you expecting that response from fans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD: </strong>No, I don&rsquo;t ever expect. I hope.<strong> </strong>The fans really grabbed it, and it went way beyond my expectations, which is really the goal of any artist. Every artist wants to be appreciated. You&rsquo;re always looking for something that is true for you, and that is appreciated by people.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: What&rsquo;s the oddest thing a fan has ever said to you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD: </strong>Um, they say some weird s--- sometimes.<strong> </strong>You know, most people are actually respectful and cool. But sometimes, even somebody who is really cool will say something weird. This has happened multiple times. They will be like, me and my boyfriend, or girlfriend, husband, wife, or lover f--- to your music all the time.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: That is weird. And how does that make you feel?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD:</strong> <em>[Laughs]</em> Like maybe I should go hop in the shower right now.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: Would you ever date a fan?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD: </strong>I would never rule anything out. I think that any relationship requires some level of balance so as long as that wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with the balance. You kind of need that someone to be your &ldquo;fan," even if they aren&rsquo;t in the audience and asking for autographs.</p>

The movie will kick off the 10th <strong><a href="http://indyfilmfest.org" target="_blank">Indy Film Fest</a></strong> tonight, and centers on best friends, played by Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson, who work at a brewery and are coupled with two others. How they may find out why they aren&rsquo;t more than friends is the matter of hand. Swanberg, whose parents live in Indianapolis, is excited to attend the festival for the first time. Here, he shares his perspectives about the film and the future of his craft.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM: What was your inspiration for <em>Drinking Buddies</em>?</strong><br /><br /><strong>JS:</strong> We tried to make a movie that was a romantic comedy that wasn&rsquo;t stale like I think a lot of romantic comedies are these days. I happen to be a big fan of that genre, but the kinds of movies I&rsquo;m interested in making are more realistic and less expected than what&rsquo;s out there. There&rsquo;s a super-easy formula to follow, and we tried not to follow that formula.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM</strong>: <strong>Do you have any patterns or themes that connect all of your movies?</strong><br /><br /><strong>JS:</strong> I&rsquo;ve always focused on relationships and broadly on communication&mdash;or lack of communication. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s continually interesting to me and always changing. Ideally, my movies are growing up with me, so my characters get a little older and wiser, and what they&rsquo;re dealing with is also changing. My first couple movies were about people just out of college with artistic ambitions and having jobs. Now they&rsquo;re about having kids and getting married. Probably 10 years from now, my characters will be middle-aged and trying to save money to send kids to college. But they&rsquo;re always dealing with the stuff of life.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><strong><img class="image_align_top_right" title="Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson in &quot;Drinking Buddies&quot; film. " src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Feeds/Articles/-2013-/07-July/Film-Fest-Q&amp;A/OliviaWilde-JakeJohnson.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="128" /></strong>IM:</strong> <strong>The film is set in Chicago&mdash;how much of it was filmed there?<br /><br />JS:</strong> We shot the majority of it in the city. The brewery scenes were shot at Revolution Brewery, right in the city. As a writer and director who lives here, I&rsquo;m able to be specific in terms of locations because I know the city. The world of the movie is realistic in terms of the neighborhoods they characters would live in, what restaurants they&rsquo;d go to, where they&rsquo;d hang out. If a Chicagoan watches this, it would feel specific and real.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> <strong>How do you think indie filmmaking has changed in the last 10 years? Where do you see it going?</strong><br /><br /> <strong>JS:</strong> The basic tools you need to make movies are getting smaller, cheaper, and more accessible. Compared to cameras that I shot my first couple movies on, for the same price cameras are vastly superior in terms of quality. The computers and hard drives also keep getting cheaper. But as a result, more movies being made. The challenge in the &lsquo;80s was to raise the capital to pay for the film stock and to get it made, and not as many [independent] films were being released each year. It&rsquo;s more of a challenge now to get into film festivals. Even regional film festivals are more competitive.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> <strong>What advice do you have for aspiring filmmakers?</strong><br /><br /><strong>JS:</strong> In a hyper-competitive industry where everyone is making movies, the way to stand out is to make stuff that is your personal vision. The only arena where nobody can compete with you is by telling your story and being true to yourself or telling a story in a way that only you can tell it. You shouldn&rsquo;t be trying to make a calling-card movie with slickness or genericness. Be prolific and productive and be very specific and true to yourself. There&rsquo;s always going to be a time later to sell out.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IM:</strong> <strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to add?</strong><br /><br /><strong>JS:</strong> I&rsquo;m just really looking forward to the screening and having a beer at Sun King.</p>

And did I mention it comes complete with a trip to Liverpool and London to follow in the band&rsquo;s footsteps? Ball State University gave me that opportunity this spring. I waved to Yoko Ono; dined with Paul McCartney&rsquo;s brother, Michael; visited Eleanor Rigby&rsquo;s grave; and sang with a Beatles cover band at the Cavern Club. The trip was the pinnacle of my university experience. And the fun didn't stop there, as this Sunday I will sing along to Beatles and Wings songs with my parents (and hopefully many of you) at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, as Paul McCartney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Out There&rdquo; tour rocks and rolls through town.</p>
<p>In preparation, let's brush up on some Beatles trivia. Some of these questions are easy, others more difficult, and a few may surprise you. The answers appear at the end of the quiz. Most important, enjoy Sunday&rsquo;s show&mdash;and remember, you&rsquo;re never too old (nor too young) to belt out your favorite Beatles song.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> All of the Beatles added a bit of their own creative flair when renovating the Casbah Club. After 54 years, John Lennon&rsquo;s Aztec-inspired doodles still remain painted on the ceilings along with his &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back&rdquo; carving. <strong>What is McCartney&rsquo;s interior-design claim to fame in the Casbah Club?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Rainbow ceiling<strong><br />B.</strong> Initials carved above front door<br /><strong>C.</strong> Pink floor<br /><strong>D.</strong> Shag carpet<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Paul often works from an office in Soho Square, London, throughout the year for his company. <strong>What is that company&rsquo;s name? </strong><em>(Note: Upon visiting, do not attempt to pose as a high school student looking for last-minute tour opportunities. The secretary will not be amused, and may smash your fingers when slamming the door in your face.)</em></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Paul and Linda, Inc.<strong><br />B.</strong> MPL Communications<br /><strong>C.</strong> Abbey Road Studios<br /><strong>D.</strong> Emmis Communications, London Bureau<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> McCartney soaked up inspiration everywhere he went. <strong>What popular 1960s album inspired him to write <em>Sgt. Pepper?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> <em>Odessey and Oracle</em> by The Zombies<br /><strong>B.</strong> <em>Aftermath</em> by The Rolling Stones<br /><strong>C.</strong> <em>Fifth Dimension</em> by The Byrds<strong><em><br /></em>D.</strong><em> Pet Sounds</em> by The Beach Boys<strong> <br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. How many steps does it take to cross Abbey Road if you are a 5-foot-2 female?</strong> The answer to this question is nearly as difficult as answering, &ldquo;How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?"&mdash;but it can be done. Just check <a href="http://www.abbeyroad.com/Crossing" target="_blank">www.abbeyroad.com/Crossing</a> for a live feed of such attempts 24 hours a day.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Sometimes the best ideas strike in the middle of the night. <strong>What lyrics did Paul wake up singing to the tune of what is now &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo;?</strong> <em>(Hint: You might also eat these for breakfast.)<br /><br /></em></p>
<p><strong><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/CircleCitizen/2013/Beatles-Paul-Liverpool/Mike%20McCartney%20no%20photo%20cred.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />6.</strong> The McCartneys' brotherly love is evident in all of Michael&rsquo;s stories, but he uses an unusual term of endearment when referring to his brother. <strong>What is Michael&rsquo;s nickname for Paul?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Our Kid<br /><strong>B.</strong> Bro<br /><strong>C.</strong> The Chosen One<br /><strong>D.</strong> Pauly Boy<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Regardless of the boy band&mdash;Beatles, Backstreet Boys, et al.&mdash;fans show their admiration in interesting ways. <strong>What candy did fans throw at the Beatles during some 1963 performances?</strong> <em>(Note: In response to your expected visceral reaction to this question, no, I can&rsquo;t believe I lumped them in with the BSB either.)<br /><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Many conspiracy theories surround the alleged death of Paul McCartney. <strong>How does the <a href="http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Abbey-Road-Album-Cover-.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Abbey Road</em></a> album cover serve as a supposed clue to these theorists?</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>What is the name of the bar that the Beatles often visited during breaks or after Cavern Club performances?</strong> Step up your wardrobe game if you visit in the evening. There is a dress code, but the club makes up for it with the cider. <em>(Hint: The bar&rsquo;s name is also a type of fruit.)</em></p>
<p><br /><strong>10.</strong> Since the beginning, Paul has expanded his musical ability through collaboration with many talented musicians. Which of these men has not written music with Paul McCartney?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Michael Jackson<br /><strong>B.</strong> Stevie Wonder<br /><strong>C.</strong> Nirvana<strong><br />D.</strong> Bruce Springsteen<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> Some of the most memorable photos of the Beatles were taken behind the scenes and away from the crowds of screaming fans. <strong>Who was the main photographer for the Beatles after their return from Hamburg?<br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> The musical structure of many Beatles songs matched the meaning behind the lyrics. <strong>The descending chord progression of which song matches its similarly depressing lyrics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> &ldquo;She Said She Said&rdquo;<br /><strong>B.</strong> &ldquo;Eleanor Rigby&rdquo;<br /><strong>C.</strong> &ldquo;Misery&rdquo;<br /><strong>D.</strong> &ldquo;A Day in the Life&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> <strong>What is the name of the street where George Harrison grew up?</strong> He also used this name as an alias when hitting on women during nights out in Liverpool.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Paul McCartney and John Lennon didn&rsquo;t always know each other. In fact, Paul had to prove himself to John during their first meeting. <strong>Where did Paul and John&rsquo;s first encounter take place? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The Cavern Club<br /><strong>B.</strong> On Penny Lane<strong><br />C.</strong> A Liverpool church<br /><strong>D.</strong> A London bar<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> 34 Montagu Square in London is where Paul McCartney recorded &ldquo;Eleanor Rigby,&rdquo; Jimi Hendrix lived and recorded &ldquo;The Wind Cries Mary,&rdquo; and John Lennon and Yoko Ono rented and took the photo that eventually became the cover of their <em>Two Virgins</em> album. <strong>Who was the famous landlord of this popular location?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Elton John<br /><strong>B.</strong> Bob Dylan<strong><br />C.</strong> Ringo Starr<br /><strong>D.</strong> Mick Jagger<br /><br /></p>

And they've been out and about, traipsing around Monument Circle downtown yesterday during the 4 p.m. hour, stopping by at Starbucks at Market and Meridian and honoring the photo-op requests of fans, including April Griggs Carter (see above).</p>
<p>Indeed, we thought a Jonas Bros sighting had occurred under our own office windows yesterday&mdash;but, as <em>IM </em>staffers went to the windows to peer down, it turned out just be <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/hoosierfeatures/2013/07/03/mastering-the-handlebar-party-bike">this beast barreling by</a> on the Circle's brick-laden street.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Jonases (Jonii?) followed on the heels of <strong>Justin Bieber</strong>'s brief stay in Indianapolis, as he <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/07/11/photos-justin-bieber-in-concert-at-bankers-life-fieldhouse">performed at Bankers Life Fieldhouse</a> on Wednesday night and then either <a href="http://radionowindy.com/1261231/justin-bieber-tried-to-get-in-at-popular-broad-ripple-nightclub-after-indy-concert-and-theres-photo-proof/" target="_blank">did or did not</a> seek to gain entry to <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/best-bars/2013/01/07/no-16-the-vogue">The Vogue</a>.

<p>The teen star's appearance elicited just the response you might imagine: stop-start traffic on Indy's downtown grid of streets, hordes of mother-daughter pairs dotting the sidewalks with anticipation, and oodles of tween screams inside the arena that pierced the air (and neighboring eardrums) without end.</p>
<p>The "Believe" tour came and went, and yet for a time, for one night only, Bieber gave his throngs of "Beliebers" exactly what they wanted: himself. A lot of himself, ducking and swooping around the stage, with and without an armada of backup dancers, and alternately changing and removing his costumes.</p>
<p>Concerts like this make for a cultural experiment for some, and a near-religious experience for others.

But that's hardly the sole reason he's buzzworthy this week.</p>
<p>Hoosiers, movie enthusiasts, and surely those who fall into both camps are practically falling off the edges of their cinema seats as they wait for confirmation: Will one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most-prized screenwriters, Charlie Kaufman, team up with the movie director for the next big novel-turned-film, a visual retelling of Kurt Vonnegut's <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>? Del Toro sure hopes so, and we do, too. <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/07/guillermo-del-toro-eyes-benedict-cumberbatch-for-f-1.html" target="_blank">He told <em>Paste </em>magazine</a>, &ldquo;Charlie Kaufman is a very expensive writer&rdquo;&mdash;and yet fans would likely argue he&rsquo;s well worth every cent. Kaufman has penned some great films over time, including 1999's <em>Being John Malkovich</em> and <em>Adaptation</em> in 2002. Thankfully, director del Toro&mdash;who interestingly helmed 2006 fantasty/horror picture <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>&mdash;says he&rsquo;s intent on making this team work. Even so, the tandem notably lacks a script at present.</p>
<p><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/CircleCitizen/2013/del-toro-fb-pic.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="342" /><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>&mdash;a time-jumping sci-fi story set largely in Dresden, Germany, during World War II&mdash;harbors great potential as a film, of course. It largely draws on the iconic author's own experience as a prisoner of Nazi forces during World War II. From alien characters dubbed Tralfamadorians to protagonist Billy Pilgrim&rsquo;s near-death plane crash, this fantastical-historical tale would surely make the most levity-laden of splashes in theaters. That is, if it does get made. And if it doesn't? Well, as Vonnegut himself would write, <em>so it goes</em>.</p>
<p>Say the book does&nbsp;<em></em>make its leap to the silver screen: What do you most hope to see? Or is this a bad idea?</p>

Indeed, this city has become a breeding ground for young entrepreneurs in recent times. Enter 23-year-old independent rap producer <a href="https://twitter.com/kelsoncamp" target="_blank"><strong>Kelson Camp</strong></a>.</p>
<p>First, he dropped out of college. But Camp made enough noise during his short run in Ball State University's music technology program to be referred to <a href="https://twitter.com/Tiara_Thomas" target="_blank"><strong>Tiara Thomas</strong></a>, an up-and-coming musician and fellow student hot on the hunt for a producer. "It's not necessarily that I didn't need schooling, but at the point where I was at, I didn't need it for what I wanted to do," Camp says. "I feel like I know what's good and what's bad. Working with music every day is what I&rsquo;ve always done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camp and Thomas had instant chemistry, and began producing tracks for fun in Camp's bedroom. Amidst the music making, one track&mdash;now known as "Bad"&mdash;became a favorite. And thanks to a connection Thomas made during a trip to Atlanta, it was heard by rap superstar <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/04/22/macklemore-talib-kweli-wale-rock-iu-concert" target="_blank"><strong>Wale</strong></a>. <em>[Note: Wale <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/04/22/macklemore-talib-kweli-wale-rock-iu-concert" target="_blank">performed at Indiana University</a> in April.]</em></p>
<p>Camp never thought the song would catch anyone's attention.</p>
<p>"I guess the track stood out to everyone that heard it," he says. "Probably because at the time I didn't typically do hip-hop production. But they called and were like, not only are we going to use it, but it's going to be the lead single on [Wale's] album that's coming out."</p>
<p>Thomas is now signed to Interscope Records, and Camp has become a hot commodity. He's now a producer on the album that debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, while that lead single, "Bad," has already been certified gold by the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TIIu9CERgI" target="_blank">The music video</a> has nearly 20 million views.</p>

<p>Nigerian Dami Olubanji was among the 300 or so people mingling and sharing stories on the lawn of the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site on Wednesday morning. Olubanji seemed to understand the joy his cousin is experiencing as the group stood and together took the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one in a million,&rdquo; Olubanji says of the opportunity to become a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker presided over the ceremony&mdash;the only one held at the historic downtown mansion each year&mdash;and welcomed the new citizens, their family members, and community members with a metaphor about &ldquo;one big tent.&rdquo; It put a smile on everyone&rsquo;s face to acknowledge that we are free to celebrate each of our unique and diverse qualities, with respect and appreciation from our friends and family under &ldquo;the big tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each naturalization ceremony is a celebration, says Stacy Clark, events coordinator of the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site. Dozens take place in Indiana throughout year after citizenship applicants spend months filing paperwork, studying the English language and U.S. history, and passing an interview.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 new citizens have been welcomed into the U.S. in 2013 so far, and more than 100 ceremonies are held across the country during the week of Independence Day alone.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:140:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/07/03/naturalization-ceremony-for-97-celebrated-at-benjamin-harrison-presidential-site";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:140:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2013/07/03/naturalization-ceremony-for-97-celebrated-at-benjamin-harrison-presidential-site";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Wed, 03 Jul 2013 15:03:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Emily Pellegrini";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Review: Dos Fallopia at Phoenix Theatre";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3282:"<p><span class="title">The comedy duo</span> of Sally Koch and Peggy Platt is a revelation in the realms of LGBT and political humor. Known as Dos Fallopia, the two women, accompanied by Deb Sargent and Kevin D. Smith, brought their variety-show-inspired sketch comedy act at the Phoenix Theatre. (Shows continue through July 14.)</p>
<p>Koch and Platt opened their performance as pair called the Polka Dots, who &ldquo;put the fun back in funeral&rdquo; at an Indiana-based funeral convention. The two kept the satire local with other references to the Hoosier state, including its &ldquo;French Lick Gay Men&rsquo;s Chorus.&rdquo; More fodder centered on the Supreme Court's recent rulings on same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>This tandem's comic timing was apparent throughout the show, but Platt&rsquo;s ability to ad-lib smart comedy was spot on. First she hushed a heckler. In a later scene parodying&nbsp;<em>Family Feud</em>, the show had "the Bunkers" facing off with audience members, with my mother as one of the chosen few. In this bit, Platt played the boisterously bigoted Archie, and Koch took on the role of Edith as they sang the theme song to&nbsp;<em>All in the Family</em>. I actually got chills, thinking the late Jean Stapleton was visiting from the afterlife. Koch&rsquo;s rendition would&rsquo;ve made her very proud. Alongside the Bunker family was Maude (Deb Sargent), whose Bea Arthur&ndash;esque tone was also obviously well rehearsed, and reminiscent of the famed character&rsquo;s voice and no-nonsense, feminist attitude.</p>
<p><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Feeds/Articles/-2013-/Dos-Fallopia/Dos-Fallopia-Copy-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="357" />Koch&rsquo;s musical talent was showcased in all of the acts, but the most apparent display of marrying music and comedy came when Koch and Platt transformed into &ldquo;Heartwood Mac" (yes, think Fleetwood). Platt went over the top in portraying a drug-riddled "Nicky Steves,&rdquo; feigning falling asleep at the mic and pulling drug paraphernalia from her brassiere. Even through several stage and costume changes, the two capably stayed in character, never letting their talents falter.</p>
<p>Heavy on the comedy, but light in its nature, Dos Fallopia isn&rsquo;t meant for children&mdash;though many of the innuendos might fly right over their heads anyway. Several very familiar songs are parodied, including Kool &amp; The Gang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Celebration,&rdquo; Johnny Cash and June Carter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; and several Fleetwood Mac favorites (&ldquo;Changes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Edge of Seventeen").</p>
<p>Skits were random and lacked fluidity from one to the next, and vintage videos shown during set and costume changes were strange and didn&rsquo;t aid the transitions, though that was likely the intention. But the show got my mother out of her comfort zone, and made for one of the best times we&rsquo;ve had at the theater. Catch it while you still can.</p>

Collaborating to create what they dub &ldquo;cowpunk,&rdquo; a subcategory of alternative folk music, the couple, performing as Kimmie &amp; Johnny, frequent Bloomington venues and have become the college town&rsquo;s top-ranked group in their genre on the music site <a title="Kimmie &amp; Johnny" href="http://www.reverbnation.com/kimmiejohnny" target="_blank">Reverbnation.com</a>. And they&rsquo;ve only been playing together for a year. &ldquo;Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I was going to be a pretend rock star,&rdquo; Knapp says.</p>
<p>Kimmie &amp; Johnny will host <a title="Cabaret Inside Edge" href="http://www.bearsplacebar.com/cal/view_entry.php?id=1018&date=20130629" target="_blank">Cabaret Inside Edge</a>, a monthly variety show, this Saturday, June 29, at Bear&rsquo;s Place in Bloomington. (They're booked to play Indy&rsquo;s <a title="The Melody Inn" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/best-bars/2013/01/02/no-24---melody-inn">Melody Inn</a> on August 11.) Known to sprinkle risque humor into their songs, Knapp and Deckard take pride in the rebellious attitude that characterizes their alt-country sound. &ldquo;If we were a rap act, the fact that we talk about weed and all that kind of stuff wouldn&rsquo;t mean a damn thing,&rdquo; Knapp says. But with each of them pushing 60 years of age, Knapp finds that audiences are often surprised by their sometimes blue material. &ldquo;People can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s singing this stuff,&rdquo; Knapp says of Deckard. They have added a third, vulgar verse to their cover of Ben E. King&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stand By Me,&rdquo; for example (not appropriate for inclusion here). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clearly country-folk based, but it has a hell of a lot of attitude,&rdquo; Knapp says.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;subversive sentimentality&rdquo; present in their lyrics is in many ways an ode to their scandalous past. The daughter of an outlaw, Deckard recalls a childhood wrought with police raids and sawed-off shotguns, things that lead her to the promise of redemption in Christianity. However, bad experiences with the church lead the mother of seven astray, and after a marijuana bust she lost her nursing license. At 56, Deckard picked up a guitar, wild to channel her exploding heart into something positive.</p>
<p>Knapp, or "Johnny Profane," as he calls himself, has had a life full of similarly unique experiences. After a brief stint in a Hindu cult, he worked as a therapist counseling cult survivors, although he eventually lost his license due to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was faced with, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost everything, what do I really want to do with my life?&rsquo;&rdquo; Knapp says. &ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;You know what? When I was a teenager, I wanted to be a musician. Let&rsquo;s try that.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="title">Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is playing defense</span> politically after his administration looked into allegations from Hoosier ciitzens that some of his staffers deleted contrary comments in response to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GovernorMikePence/posts/399209633531127" target="_blank">a post on his official Facebook page</a>. That dispatch had reaffirmed his belief that "<span class="messageBody" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:3}"><span class="userContent">marriage is the union between a man and a woman and is a unique institution worth defending,"</span></span> and arrived on the heels of two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, <em>U.S. v. Windsor </em>and <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry</em>. SCOTUS had opened the door for same-sex marriage to be reimplemented as law in the face of California's Proposition 8.</p>
<p>Facebook users who disagreed with Pence's position angrily assailed him with their own original posts via that social-media channel and by commenting time and again on his page. <span class="messageBody" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:3}"><span class="userContent">This morning, Pence and his staff <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GovernorMikePence/posts/400100000108757" target="_blank">wrote again on his Facebook page</a>, saying "<span class="messageBody" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:3}"><span class="userContent">Our longstanding policy, on this and other social media sites, has been to delete inflammatory comments that include name-calling, vulgarity or comments personally insulting to others. ... On careful review, it appear that this was not always the case and some comments were being deleted simply because they expressed disagreement with my position."</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Pence did not backtrack, however, from his previous post's statements, which included these foreshadowing words: &ldquo;Now that the Supreme Court has had its say on the federal government&rsquo;s role in defining marriage, the people of Indiana should have their say about how marriage is understood and defined in our state. ... I am confident that Hoosiers will reaffirm our commitment to traditional marriage <span class="messageBody" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:3}"><span class="userContent">...

<p>Here's another idea: Detour to a pair of new Lincoln attractions instead.</p>
<p>Saturday, June 29, brings the third installment of the museum's summer Lincoln lecture series. If it's anything like the premiere talk earlier this month, it will be a real treat. On June 1, an expert from the Lincoln presidential library in Springfield enthralled a small gathering in a cool auditorium with new documents and related theories that have surfaced in the Lincoln scholarly community. For instance, a handwritten note from 1865 that says "Let this man be discharged" is believed to be Lincoln's. But because a baseline fingerprint for Abe does not exist, the provenance can't be confirmed. Also, there's new reason to believe that Lincoln took his oldest son, Robert, to a Terre Haute doctor around 1850 to receive treatment for a dog bite&mdash;treatment that amounted to rubbing the wound with a "mad stone." The same year, they also went to the Peoria Eye Institute for Robert to have surgery (<em>surgery</em>&mdash;in 1850!) on his cross eye. Together, they show that Lincoln was open to both folk medicine and new surgical techniques.</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Feeds/Feed%20Images/LincolnCabinets.jpg" alt="Thomas Lincoln cabinets; courtesy Indiana State Museum" width="200" height="256" />Saturday's lecturer is Steve Haaff, a historian and teacher at South Spencer High School, near the site of Indiana's Lincoln Boyhood National Monument. Haaff is an expert on furniture made by Lincoln's father, Thomas, a skilled and artful carpenter. Two of Thomas's cabinets will be available for perusal and photos, including one that hasn't been displayed at the museum before.</p>
<p>Plus, a newly discovered Lincoln artifact from his Hoosier years was just added to the museum's exhibit <em>The Lincolns: Five Generations of an American Family</em>. It's the 11th leaf from Lincoln's Sum Book, a math study guide he created while growing up in Southern Indiana. Previously, only 10 pages of the Sum Book were widely known to exist. The 11th was found at a Harvard library in 2009, and reproductions were recently given to the museum.</p>

<p>Attorneys at the Indianapolis firm of Barnes &amp; Thornburg recently filed a civil suit on behalf of Robert and Charlene Spierer, against three of the young men who came into contact with Lauren on the morning she went missing: Jason Rosenbaum, Corey Rossman, and Mike Beth. The complaint accuses the defendants of &ldquo;negligent actions&rdquo; resulting in &ldquo;the disappearance, injury, and death of Lauren Elizabeth Spierer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spierers&rsquo; lawsuit contradicts some information included in <em>IM</em>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/2012/05/30/the-lauren-spierer-mystery-unraveled">report</a> from June 2011, printed one year after Lauren went missing. Among the facts alleged in the <a title="Spierer filing" href="http://media.theindychannel.com/docs/spiererlawsuitfiled.pdf" target="_blank">filing</a>&mdash;drawn from tips, law-enforcement sources, defendant interviews, and <a title="Bo Dietl" href="http://media.theindychannel.com/docs/spiererlawsuitfiled.pdf">private investigators</a> hired by the family&mdash;are claims that Beth had visited Rosenbaum&rsquo;s apartment on the morning of the disappearance, returned to his apartment to find Rossman and Spierer, and then escorted Spierer back to Rosenbaum&rsquo;s apartment. Beth&rsquo;s attorney, Ron Chapman, previously <a title="Spierer timeline" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/story.aspx?ID=1712477">told</a> <em>IM</em> that Beth had stayed in his apartment all night to work on school papers; a fellow IU student who lived in the same building recalled a conversation in which Beth reportedly said he had seen Spierer in his apartment, walked upstairs, and then returned to find that she had already left<strong>.</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>In December,<strong> </strong><em>IM </em><a title="Spierer update" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/circlecitizen/2012/12/04/figures-from-lauren-spierer-investigation-ret">reported</a> that since leaving IU, Rosenbaum&mdash;the last known person to see Spierer&mdash;had launched a tech startup in Michigan with friend David Bleznak. Rosenbaum&rsquo;s attorneys, <a title="Jim Voyles" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/Story.aspx?id=1447543">Jim Voyles</a> and Jennifer Lukemeyer, previously described their client's meeting with Spierer&rsquo;s parents to <em>IM</em>. &ldquo;He was pretty frank with them," said Lukemeyer. "Some of it, they admitted, they may not want to hear, but they&rsquo;ve been pretty realistic, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rossman was quoted in May in a <a title="Journal News" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/23/missing-indiana-student-parents-harassment/2356267/" target="_blank">story</a> by Shawn Cohen of the <em>Journal News</em> in Westchester County, New York, saying, "It's inappropriate the way [Spierer&rsquo;s parents] are harassing people that are also victims in this case.&rdquo; However, in reply to a follow-up email from <em>IM</em>, Rossman wrote that &ldquo;the comments which were reported by Shawn Cohen to be said by me in a recent article were falsified and I am still not speaking to any reporters at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he would not answer questions about his clients&rsquo; lawsuit on the record, attorney Jason R. Barclay did provide <em>IM </em>with a statement. &ldquo;We intend to use the rights afforded by the civil justice system to obtain answers to questions that have gone unanswered for too long,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>

<p>For the Colts-Broncos game, that average ticket price is $467.
