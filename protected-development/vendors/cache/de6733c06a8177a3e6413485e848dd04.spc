USA Funds matched the first $50,000 raised and pledged an additional $50,000.  Several organizations, including Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) and Efroymson Family Fund announced matching gifts during the event.</p><p>The evening included special recognition for former USA Funds President and CEO Carl Dalstrom, who has supported the scholarship dinner since its inception. Dalstrom retired from USA Funds on June 30.</p><p>&ldquo;While higher education certainly improves the lives of graduates, it also improves all of our lives. This means that all of us, corporations and individuals alike, benefit from investments in education, and these students. And what better way to get a return on that investment than focusing on one of the fastest growing populations in America. I therefore have been very proud to have been a part of this effort to help Latino students get into and stay in college with scholarships,&rdquo; said Dalstrom.</p><p>In addition, the Indiana Latino Scholarship Fund honored Cummins Inc. This corporation was selected because of its demonstrated commitment to education and diversity.  Since 2010, Cummins in coordination with the Community Education Coalition of Columbus has significantly supported the Latino Education and Outreach initiative in the Columbus area. Programs include: neighborhood outreach, summer school, events to bring the overall community together with the Latino community, and education alignment efforts from Pre-K through Post Secondary.</p><p>The 500 guests attending the dinner heard from several students who have received scholarships from ILSF. This year alone, 85 students were awarded scholarships.</p><p>U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., told the students, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of everything you&rsquo;ve accomplished, everyone in our state, to have done so many wonderful things in school, to have achieved this opportunity. And I promise you this, when you get this education that you will continue on the road to, as you stay in school and you continue in school, that will be the key that will unlock all the dreams you have because you can accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p><p>The Indiana Latino Scholarship Fund also recognized the following five Indiana state legislators for their support of expanded higher education opportunities for Indiana Latinos:</p><p>Senator Earline Rogers <br />Senator Jean Leising <br />Representative Rebecca Kubacki <br />Representative Mara Candelaria Reardon <br />Senator Carlin Yoder</p><p>In the spring of 2008, seven organizations created the Indiana Latino Scholarship Fund to support key Latino community-based organizations that already provide scholarships to Latino students. As a result, the Indiana Latino Scholarship Fund&rsquo;s combined fundraising efforts and resources generated a larger pool of funds, resulting in more financial opportunities through scholarships awarded to Indiana&rsquo;s top Latino students. To date, more than $1.5 million has been raised for ILSF.</p><p>The Indiana Latino Scholarship Fund nonprofit member organizations include: Central Indiana Community Foundation, Indiana Latino Institute, La Plaza, Mexican Scholarship Fund, Project Stepping Stone, Sociedad de Amigos de Colombia, and USA Funds.</p><p>&ldquo;Central Indiana Community Foundation is proud to continue its support of the Latino Scholarship Fund, and to help these hard-working, determined students achieve the education they need to become more successful in life. They are an incredibly valuable resource, and we believe the entire community will benefit from this investment for many years &ndash; and many generations &ndash; to come,&rdquo; said Brian Payne, President and CEO of Central Indiana Community Foundation.</p><p>According to the U.S. Census, the number of Hispanic youth under 18 years of age in Indiana doubled from 2000 to 2012.

Campbell isn&rsquo;t your stereotypical boxer. She isn&rsquo;t sporting rock-hard biceps or abs, or anything else, and her nose shows no signs of ever being broken. What Campbell really looks like is what she is &ndash; a 61 year-old grandmother in an &quot;Eat My Dust&quot; t-shirt, who, in this case, is afflicted with Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease. After moving to the full-size punching bag, Campbell shifts, turns her body, then launches a solid right hand jab. The punch lands, but doesn&rsquo;t inflict any real damage; today, she&rsquo;s just working out in the gym. But in that split second, Campbell&rsquo;s ability to combine the movement, strength and coordination necessary to simply throw the punch makes her a winner.</p><table width="260" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" align="right"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;<img width="280" height="250" alt="" src="/files/image/rock steady karen.jpg" /></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><font class="blue "><small>Karen Campbell prepares to land a blow to a punching bag at one of her two weekly workouts at Rock Steady Boxing.</small></font></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;<img width="280" height="210" alt="" src="/files/image/stop underestimating yourself.jpg" /></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><font class="blue "><small>A focus on ability - rather than limits - is central to Rock Steady Boxing's approach to working with boxers with Parkinson's Disease.<br /></small></font></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;<img width="280" height="215" alt="" src="/files/image/bea fink.JPG" /></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<small><font class="blue ">Bea Fink, Rock Steady's oldest pugilist, celebrates her 92nd birthday alongside her trainers.

Her diagnosis came just three weeks after a friend of hers had passed away from Parkinson&rsquo;s. That connection proved to be valuable for Karen, because that friend had been a part of creating a special organization that aimed to helped people fight Parkinson&rsquo;s by quite literally throwing punches to slow the disease.</p><p>At that organization, Rock Steady Boxing, Parkinson&rsquo;s patients wrap their hands, pull on boxing gloves and throw punches at speed bags. Parkinson&rsquo;s is a progressive disease that directly affects the central nervous system. For most patients, early symptoms impact movement including tremors, rigidity, shaking and loss of movement, but dementia and depression are also symptoms. At Rock Steady Boxing, Parkinson&rsquo;s patients fight to slow the progression of the disease as they clobber punching bags, run laps and often step into the boxing ring.</p><p>From Campbell&rsquo;s point of view, her twice-weekly visits to Rock Steady Boxing, an organization supported by both Indianapolis Foundation and CICF donor-advised fund grants, have had a real impact. She increased her balance, restored her ability to rotate her upper body &ndash; which allows her to keep driving safely &ndash; and improved her balance. It&rsquo;s also made it possible for her to regularly get down on the floor with her grandchildren.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the positive thing I can do to fight the disease,&rdquo; says Campbell, who also fought cancer before getting her Parkinson&rsquo;s diagnosis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s truly life-changing.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p><h4><font class="blue ">A Prosecutor, Parkinson&rsquo;s &amp; A Personal Connection</font></h4><p>Rock Steady Boxing began in 2006, founded by former Marion County Prosecutor, Scott C. Newman, who had been utilizing boxing to manage his early-onset Parkinson&rsquo;s for a few years. He had seen a dramatic shift in his own health and wanted to share those results with others. The unique blend of agility, endurance and strength training appears, anecdotally, to be slowing and, on occasion, reversing symptoms among Parkinson&rsquo;s patients.</p><p>After adding a former World Champion boxer, Kristy Rose Follmar, as head trainer plus another certified trainer whose own husband is battling Parkinson&rsquo;s, Christine Timberlake, the program expanded rapidly. With more and more boxers joining, Rock Steady Boxing also refined their program, ensuring that they meet the needs of women, men, old, young and individuals with a wide range of progression and symptoms. Currently, they have four levels of ability and boxers from age 42 to 92 years.</p><p>Today, the organization is led by Executive Director Joyce Johnson, who previously worked with another young organization, Starfish Initiative. Johnson came to the organization with a mission of strengthening their sustainability efforts and building on their successes. But she also has a very personal connection to the organization and her job: Johnson&rsquo;s mother had lived with Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that my mother ever would have boxed,&rdquo; says Johnson. &ldquo;But there are 20-some different symptoms that affect people different ways &ndash; and knowing that would have made a big difference to me. This is an opportunity for me to help others appreciate the struggles that people with Parkinson&rsquo;s are going through, things I wish I had known.&rdquo; <br />&nbsp;</p><h4><font class="blue ">A Community Hub</font></h4><p>Parkinson&rsquo;s patients find out about Rock Steady Boxing from several sources. Word of mouth is a significant source of referrals, as are stories in the media. Increasingly, though, neurologists are writing &ldquo;Rock Steady Boxing&rdquo; on prescription pads, as they see many clients who box significantly slowing the progress of the disease. Coupled with early research results from the University of Indianapolis&rsquo; School of Physical Therapy, the anecdotal impact is attracting attention from other Parkinson&rsquo;s-focused organizations.</p><p>Rock Steady Boxing recently introduced a three-day training program for other groups that want to utilize their model to fight Parkinson&rsquo;s. Participants have come from as close as the JCC of Indianapolis (where Karen Campbell hopes to attend a third weekly class) and as far as Australia.</p><p>Slowing the disease is at the center of Rock Steady&rsquo;s mission, but the organization also seeks to build a supportive community around their boxers. Instead of offering a circle of chairs and introspective conversation, as in a support group, Rock Steady gives people a chance to connect around achievement and activity.</p><p>The value of that supportive approach is clear when one boxer, Mary Yeaman, enthusiastically tells other boxers, trainers, and the Executive Director about another boxer&rsquo;s pride at getting his Mini Marathon and 5K medal as one of the 30 Rock Steady Boxers who ran or walked in the event. &ldquo;At night, Bob sleeps with it under his pillow,&rdquo; she says, beaming. Yeaman has been boxing since 2007 and is also a dedicated volunteer.</p><p>The organization has also out-grown their existing space which they were able to use and outfit with help from Impact 100 and Peak Performance Fitness. This summer, they will move to a new, 12,800-square foot location that will increase their workout space and include a larger boxing ring. The started the process of moving earlier this week. With the goal of building an information and support hub for the Parkinson&rsquo;s community, the new location will also have office space for Rock Steady, the Parkinson&rsquo;s Awareness Association of Central Indiana and the Cornerman Lounge, a place for caregivers, researchers and workshop participants.</p><p>With the new facility, Rock Steady aims to forge new connections and expand their impact. But their top goal remains clear - they are providing Parkinson's patients with a chance to do something active and positive to regain control of their health.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of them feel like they&rsquo;re fighting for their lives,&rdquo; says Joyce Johnson. &ldquo;When they come early in their disease, they feel that they are doing something to delay or reverse their disease. We're here to support that.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>Read more about the <a href="http://www.cicf.org/cicf-news/category/the-indianapolis-foundation">impact of Indianapolis Foundation grants</a>.<br />&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://www.cicf.org/cicf-news/2013/july/landing-a-blow-to-a-dreadful-disease";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 Dec 1969 18:00:00 -0600";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"The Indianapolis Foundation Awards $100,000 To The Indy Public Safety Foundation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9283:"<p><a href="http://www.cicf.org/the-indianapolis-foundation">The Indianapolis Foundation</a>, an affiliate of Central Indiana Community Foundation, has awarded a $100,000 grant to the Indy Public Safety Foundation.

It awards approximately $7 million annually to support current and future community needs, and is governed by a board of six publicly-appointed trustees (two are appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis; two by the Marion County Circuit Court Judge; and two by the United States District Court presiding over Indianapolis).</p><p><font class="blue ">ABOUT CENTRAL INDIANA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION: </font><br />Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) is a $600 million+ public foundation transforming the lives of central Indiana residents in three ways: consulting donors, family foundations and their professional advisors on charitable giving; awarding grants to effective not-for-profit organizations; and providing leadership to seize opportunities and address community needs.

The task force examined the underlying problems that led to a surge in violent crime in Indianapolis and in 2007 recommended actions to stem the violence and to prevent crime before it occurs. In July 2007, the City-County Council passed Proposal No. 264 to increase the County Option Income Tax (COIT) and establish the Community Crime Prevention Grant (CCPG) program to provide funding for crime prevention initiatives recommended by the Task Force its January 2007 final report.</p><p>In June 2012, the Community Crime Prevention Grant program awarded over $1.8M to 18 organizations that specifically provided support to youth programs and to programs that helped previously incarcerated individuals back in to jobs and back in to the community. At the request of the City-County Council, in April, 2013, The Indianapolis Foundation, a Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) affiliate, entered into a contract with the City of Indianapolis to manage the $2 million Community Crime Prevention Grant program.&nbsp;The Indianapolis Foundation Board of Trustees has agreed to serve as the fiscal agent and grant manager for the 2013 $2 million Community Crime Prevention Grant allocation, with resources going to support community-based organizations that can demonstrate community impact.<br /><br />The previous Community Crime Prevention Grant Program, which ended as of May 31st, 2013, was administered by the Indianapolis Parks Foundation. All previous Community Crime Prevention Grant recipients were invited to reapply for grants from July 1 to July 31, 2013.</p><p>The Indianapolis Foundation has worked since the culmination of the 2012 Community Crime Prevention Grant Program (May 31, 2013) to create a process that is transparent and holistic in its approach of administering public resources to achieve the greatest public impact. This work included a &ldquo;listening tour&rdquo; of many of the city&rsquo;s non-profit organizations that provide related and/or associated crime prevention services. The Foundation will continue to solicit input from community leaders and residents to help develop strategies that address both the symptoms and root causes of crime in Indianapolis and Marion County.</p><p>The Indianapolis Foundation is accepting applications from nonprofit organizations that seek to:</p><ul><li>Prevent violent crimes among residents</li><li>Provide intervention or prevention services to adults or youth facing unique challenges</li><li>Improve neighborhood safety</li><li>And/or partner with public agencies to help reduce or prevent crime in our community.</li></ul><p>For additional information, Community Crime Prevention Grant organizations are encouraged to visit www.cicf.org.</p><p>For additional grant information, contact Alicia Barnett at abarnett@cicf.org, or 317.634.2423.</p><p><strong>ABOUT THE INDIANAPOLIS FOUNDATION: </strong><br />Established in 1916, The Indianapolis Foundation was one of the first community trusts in America. The Foundation is a public charity and an affiliate of Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF), a collaborative effort between the community foundations serving Marion and Hamilton Counties. As Indiana&rsquo;s oldest and largest community foundation, The Indianapolis Foundation was created to ensure that the quality of life in Marion County continuously improves; to help where the needs are greatest and the benefits to the community are most extensive; and to provide donors a vehicle for using their gifts in the best possible way now, and in the future as conditions in the community change. It awards approximately $7 million annually to support current and future community needs, and is governed by a board of six publicly-appointed trustees (Two are appointed by the Mayor of Indianapolis; two by the Marion County Circuit Court Judge; and two by the United States District Court presiding over Indianapolis).</p><p><strong>ABOUT CENTRAL INDIANA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION: </strong><br />Central Indiana Community Foundation (CICF) is a $600 million+ public foundation transforming the lives of central Indiana residents in three ways: consulting donors, family foundations and their professional advisors on charitable giving; awarding grants to effective not-for-profit organizations; and providing leadership to seize opportunities and address community needs. CICF was established in 1997 as a partnership between The Indianapolis Foundation, serving Marion County since 1916, and Legacy Fund, serving Hamilton County since 1991.

The recipients were among 265 artists who submitted applications.</p> <p>The Efroymson Contemporary Arts Fellowship&rsquo;s were created to encourage emerging and established contemporary artists to continue their artistic professional development. The Fellowship&rsquo;s relative lack of restrictions makes it unique among national fellowships.

Scott summarizes his practice as a physical and conceptual investigation into the possibilities of objects, materials and spaces. He finds satisfaction in the acts of re-use, re-contextualization and function in relation to contemporary art. Scott intends to use a majority of the fellowship to support his first international solo exhibition with Beers.Lambert Contemporary Art in London in Spring, 2014. The remainder of the fellowship will be used for studio rental, living expenses, and related equipment and supplies for his 2013-2014 exhibitions.</p> <p><font class="blue "><strong>Sarah FitzSimons</strong></font>: 35, Madison, Wisconsin; Sculpture.  Sarah is a project-based sculpture artist whose work, installed indoors or outdoors, interacts with and derives meaning from its surroundings. Much of her work seeks to connect our constructed culture and daily lives with the wider patterns of nature. With this fellowship, Sarah would focus on completing two projects currently in development (House Frames and Ocean Objects).  Support will specifically be used for living expenses, travel for artistic research and to install new works, studio assistants and equipment and supplies.</p> <p><font class="blue "><strong>Jason Lazarus</strong></font>: 37, Chicago, Illinois; Sculpture/Installation.  Jason's work focuses on mining private, marginalized, and public histories to recast the relationships among the historical and the contemporary. Often employing found objects, creating wall installations, and curating archives, his practice embraces the interplay of construction and appropriation, private and public, and the pathos of both the mundane and a marked event. Jason will use the fellowship award to invest in a new studio space, research, proto-type and fabricate new works (Dash and Tornado Sculptures), living expenses, studio assistants and a summer residency.</p> <p><strong><font class="blue ">Harold Mendez</font></strong>: 35, Chicago, Illinois Installation.  Harold uses his work to explore how identity and place is constructed, dismantled and then stitched together. His work attempts to reconsider the relationship between visibility and memory. He is motivated by the political implications created by slippages between memory, fact, and fiction. Using a diverse array of materials he draws upon concrete ideas of absence, displacement, and erasure to reference reconstructions of place and identity. Harold will use the fellowship for travel for artistic research to Colombia, South America, studio rental, living expenses and travel and supplies to create new works for upcoming exhibitions in Sausalito, California and St. Paul, Minnesota</p> <p><strong><font class="blue ">Roy Staab</font></strong>: 71, West Allis, Wisconsin; Sculpture.  Roy's work involves creating large installations using natural materials from a specific site. He uses nature as a contributor to his work in the form of light, wind, and sometimes, fair weather for a clear reflection. The shape and figure of his work relates directly to the site and situation. Roy will use the fellowship to create five new art-in-nature installations, pay for living expenses and purchase equipment to photograph and document his work.</p><p><font class="blue "><strong>View the work of the 2013 Efroymson Contemporary Arts Fellows</strong></font></p><p><iframe width="500" scrolling="no" height="401" frameborder="0" src="http://app.sliderocket.com:80/app/fullplayer.aspx?id=e75179c9-cf3d-4808-a265-57cfabb76972"></iframe></p> <p>A five-member selection committee consisting of national and regional representatives chose the five recipients in a blind selection process.
