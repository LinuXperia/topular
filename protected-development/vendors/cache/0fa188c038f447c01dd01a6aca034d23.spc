Although the plan will not be formally adopted until November, Commissioner Bud Selig called today &#8220;historic,&#8221; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/08/15/mlb-instant-replay-manager-challenges-on-hold/2659555/" target="_blank">per USA Today</a>, suggesting that he sees the new replay system as a fait accompli.</p>
<p>Selig is right that, when the changes kick in, the game will be changed by all historic standards. Included in the new replay program (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/08/15/mlb-instant-replay-manager-challenges-on-hold/2659555/" target="_blank">per USA Today</a> &#8211; though I think some of the finer details are still being worked out, so this isn&#8217;t quite yet gospel):</p>
<ul>
<li>Every play outside of balls and strikes will be subject to review.</li>
<li>Managers will be able to initiate a review by &#8220;challenging&#8221; a play. They will have three challenges per game &#8211; one for the first six innings, and then two for the rest of the game.</li>
<li>If a manager&#8217;s challenge is successful, he doesn&#8217;t lose that challenge.</li>
<li>Even if all challenges are exhausted, the umpiring crew can, on its own, initiate the review of a home run call.</li>
<li>A centralized crew in New York will conduct all reviews and make the final decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reaction?</p>
<p>For me, I&#8217;m envisioning lengthened games, particularly those involving managers who make certain to use up all of their challenges every single game (maybe even using them to distract an opposing pitcher or give a little more time for a reliever to warm up). If the manager is correct on a couple, that could be <em>five </em>reviews in a single game from <em>one </em>team. And what&#8217;s to stop that manager from coming out to at least argue subsequent calls he doesn&#8217;t like?</p>
<p>I like the idea of getting calls right, but I really don&#8217;t like &#8220;challenge&#8221; systems. Just have a centralized hub, monitoring all games, and they buzz the local umpiring crew if they feel a certain call needs to be reviewed further. The game is temporarily paused, the centralized hub conducts the review, and informs the crew of the decision. In theory, it should happen only a handful of times per game, and shouldn&#8217;t take much time for each review. Once you inject a layer of partiality &#8211; the managers &#8211; you&#8217;re going to have gamesmanship. Haven&#8217;t we seen that already in the NFL? I find the Big Ten&#8217;s automatic review system to be far, far preferable.</p>

This could exacerbate the problem.</p>

Well, &#8220;reverse standings&#8221; is more accurate, since the playoffs aren&#8217;t in this team&#8217;s future for 2013. Instead, all that matters is where the team finishes relative to the overall records of the rest of the league.</p>
<p>My position on losing &#8211; and, given that I&#8217;ve been covering the Cubs at BN since the Winter of 2008, I have had to have this discussion every single year &#8211; is that it sucks. I don&#8217;t like it. I don&#8217;t like watching the Cubs lose, and I can&#8217;t bring myself to actively root against them while watching a game.</p>
<p>That said, I recognize that, in the grander scheme of things, if the Cubs aren&#8217;t going to seriously challenge for the playoffs, the benefits of losing 90+ games probably outweigh the slight benefits of winning 75 games instead of 70. Those benefits include a better draft pick in 2014 (including a larger draft bonus pool), a larger international spending pool in 2014 (all of which the Cubs can use, <a title="Theo Epstein Confirms the Cubs’ International Spending Approach, Discusses Free Agent Spending" href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2013/08/14/theo-epstein-confirms-the-cubs-international-spending-approach-discusses-free-agent-spending/">even if they are subject to penalties</a>), the ability to focus on young player development/evaluation, and a variety of other things <a href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2012/05/22/the-upside-of-awful-a-review-of-the-benefits-to-the-cubs-of-sucking-in-2012/" target="_blank">I wrote about in May 2012 as I looked ahead into a sea of awful</a>.</p>
<p>Because the Astros, White Sox, and Marlins are sufficiently awful that I can&#8217;t envision a realistic scenario where the Cubs pass any of them in losses, I&#8217;m not going to focus today on the very &#8220;top&#8221; of the reverse standings. Instead, I&#8217;d like to focus on the range in which &#8211; again, assuming the Cubs are going to pile up losses either way &#8211; you&#8217;d like to see the Cubs settle by the end of the year: the bottom ten teams.</p>
<p>Why does being in the bottom ten (the &#8220;playoffs&#8221; of the reverse standings!) matter? Well, if you pick in the top 10 picks in 2014, your first round selection is &#8220;protected.&#8221; In other words, when a team signs a free agent who has been extended a qualifying offer (i.e., the best of the best free agents), that team loses its first round pick the next year &#8230; <em>unless </em>that team picks in the top 10 picks. In that instance, all that is lost is a second round pick.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t foresee the Cubs going aggressively after too many top free agents this offseason, but if there is even one whom they really like (Jacoby Ellsbury?), then having a protected first round pick is a great benefit. The prospect of losing the 11th overall pick in the Draft is a much more ponderous consideration than losing the 10th pick in the second round.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s look at where things stand:</p>
<p>1. Houston Astros (39-80)<br />
2. Miami Marlins (46-73)<br />
3. Chicago White Sox (46-73)<br />
<strong>4. Chicago Cubs (52-68)</strong><br />
5. Milwaukee Brewers (52-68)<br />
6. San Francisco Giants (52-67)<br />
7. Philadelphia Phillies (53-67)<br />
8. Los Angeles Angels (53-66)<br />
9. Minnesota Twins (53-65)<br />
10. San Diego Padres (54-66)<br />
12. New York Mets (54-64)<br />
13. Toronto Blue Jays (55-65)<br />
14. Seattle Mariners (55-64)</p>
<p>After the Mariners, there are a collection of teams that could plausibly fall into the bottom ten, but it doesn&#8217;t seem realistic that the would pass the Cubs. While the Cubs currently sport the fourth worst record in the league (thanks to a losing streak and some untimely wins from the Brewers, the two teams are tied), as you can see, a huge number of teams are bunched up together behind the abominable trio at the top.</p>
<p>On a glance, I could see the Twins, Padres, Mets and Mariners moving &#8220;up,&#8221; and the Giants, Phillies, Angels, and Blue Jays moving &#8220;down.&#8221; Which is to say, the former group of teams, I think, are probably going to continue to be quite bad, while the latter four are probably better than they&#8217;ve been showing.</p>
<p>If things play out in that way, you&#8217;d probably see the Cubs settle into the five to eight range (there&#8217;s no way the Cubs are losing more games than the Brewers &#8211; you can book it), and their pick would remain protected. It would take a fairly serious winning stretch for the Cubs to &#8220;fall&#8221; out of the bottom ten records, but it remains something worth watching.</p>

He was brought in as a swing man, and that&#8217;s precisely what he&#8217;s done well for the Cubs. Having a guy like that is very valuable, and I&#8217;m glad the Cubs have him for 2014, as well.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that move back into the bullpen for Villanueva is the man coming up to take his spot in the rotation: Jake Arrieta. The 27-year-old righty, whom the Cubs acquired from Baltimore in the Scott Feldman trade, has been throwing relatively well at Iowa (3.56 ERA, 11.6 K/9, but 1.582 WHIP) and had a nice spot-start in the July 30 doubleheader against the Brewers. He was acquired with an eye toward being a possible rotation piece in 2014, and now the Cubs will give him a six-week audition.</p>
<p>The stuff has always been impressive, and Arrieta was long a top prospect with the Orioles. He had trouble harnessing that stuff consistently in the bigs, and saw his ERA degrade over the years to the point where it was over 5 in 2011, over 6 in 2012, and over 7 in the early part of 2013. The peripherals and advanced stats were better than that, but we can&#8217;t ignore that the results, so far, haven&#8217;t been where you&#8217;d want them to be. He&#8217;ll get to work with pitching coach Chris Bosio, who has seemed to do incredible things for a number of Cubs pitchers, and I&#8217;m excited about the possibilities. (In his <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=9568792" target="_blank">podcast appearance with Keith Law</a>, Cubs VP of Scouting and Player Development noted, specifically, that he was very &#8220;bullish&#8221; on Arrieta.)</p>
<p>For his part, <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130814&amp;content_id=56963816&amp;notebook_id=56963972&amp;vkey=notebook_chc&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Dale Sveum couched the timing</a> of the call-up in terms of Matt Guerrier going down and the Cubs needing to replace his spot in the pen, and the desire to see Chris Rusin continue to get starts.</p>
<p>While I think that&#8217;s legitimate, we should also note that there are service time implications in Arrieta coming up to stay now, as opposed to immediately after he was traded. Coming into the season, Arrieta had two years and 66 days of service time. If he&#8217;d spent the full year in the big leagues this year, he would have gone well over the three years required to qualify for arbitration (a &#8220;year&#8221; of service time is 172 days), and then free agency after the 2016 season. Arrieta did not spend the full year in the bigs, however, as the Orioles sent him down in late April, before calling him back up in mid-May. He was sent down a few days after that, and then called back up for a few more days in June. He was sent back down, and then traded to the Cubs.</p>
<p>If my counting skillz are what they were back in elementary school, I&#8217;ve got Arrieta accumulating 29 days of big league service time with the Orioles this year. That puts his total at two years and 95 days before being traded to the Cubs. Had Arrieta immediately been inserted into the rotation with the Cubs following the July 2 trade, he would have added another 89 days of service time, which would have taken him over the 172-game threshold, and he would have completed his third full year before the offseason (triggering arbitration and only three more years before free agency).</p>
<p>If Arrieta stays up the rest of the way starting Friday, however, he will reach only two years and 141 days of big league service time by the end of this year (an additional 45 days with the Cubs, plus adding one more day for the game on July 30th he pitched with the Cubs). That means, even if Arrieta sticks with the big club the rest of the way and then for years to come, he will not reach free agency until after 2017 (because he won&#8217;t have reached six full years of service time until then).</p>
<p>Arbitration is going to be a different story, however, because, with two years and 141 days of service time, Arrieta is very likely to qualify for Super Two status. That status, granted to the top 22% (in terms of service time) of players with more than two years of service time but less than three years, will send Arrieta to arbitration for the first time after this season (and then for three more go-arounds in the three years thereafter). Before the latest CBA, which bumped the cutoff to 22% from 17%, Arrieta might not have qualified for Super Two &#8211; the cutoff, historically, <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/04/projected-super-two-cutoff.html" target="_blank">has been around two years and 130 to 140 days</a>. But, if this past year&#8217;s post-CBA cutoff is any guide, Arrieta is almost certain to qualify (the cutoff was just two years and 119 days).</p>
<p>Had the Cubs kept Arrieta down until early September, they could have tried to avoid Super Two status. But they might believe seeing him for a longer stretch at the big league level (and having him work with the coaching staff there) is more valuable than the mere possibility of paying more money down the road. Given his up and down track record, Arrieta isn&#8217;t a lock to stay with the Cubs as a dominant starter for the next four years, so you&#8217;re a lot less worried about arbitration raises at this point. It&#8217;s nice to have ensured the extra year of control, though &#8211; just in case.</p>
<p>In the end, I tend to think that the timing of Arrieta&#8217;s call-up really is just about giving him enough time at the big league level for the Cubs to get a legitimate look. I think, given Arrieta&#8217;s particular situation, the Cubs probably weren&#8217;t terribly worried about the prospect of Super Two status (though it could have saved them a million or two heading into 2014, depending on how much Arrieta now makes in his first arbitration year, which will come in 2014 instead of 2015). I suspect they did like the idea of him adjusting a little bit down at Iowa after the trade, conveniently ensuring the Cubs that extra year of control (which could be enormously valuable if Arrieta finally breaks out). Generally, though, I don&#8217;t think there were a whole lot of service time games being played. Service time issues may have been a peripheral consideration in Arrieta&#8217;s path, but if they were the primary factor, we probably wouldn&#8217;t have seen him until September. As it is, he&#8217;s coming up tomorrow, and I believe the Cubs really do just want to give Arrieta a long look &#8211; which might be the most valuable decision of all.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A thoughtful tipster who would be in a position to know points me in the direction of an underdiscussed (indeed, I&#8217;ve never seen anyone discuss it) clause in the Super Two provision of the CBA: &#8220;In addition, a Player with at least two but less than three years of Major League service shall be eligible for salary arbitration if: (a) he has accumulated at least 86 days of service during the immediately preceding season; and (b)he ranks in the top 22% (rounded to the nearest whole number) in total service in the class of Players who have at least two but less than three years of Major League service, however accumulated, <strong>but with at least 86 days of service accumulated during the immediately preceding season</strong>.&#8221; (emphasis mine) By that language, Arrieta would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> qualify for Super Two status, even if he would fall into that top 22% group, because he will have accumulated just 75/76 days of Major League service time this year. The timing of Arrieta&#8217;s call-up makes even more sense now, and will ensure the Cubs both an additional year of control, as well as avoiding Super Two status. It&#8217;s a bit of tough luck for Arrieta, but a savvy &#8211; and completely justifiable for non-financial reasons &#8211; move by the Cubs.</p>

<li><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/cubs/post/_/id/19187/bryant-should-be-cubs-starting-3b-in-2014" target="_blank">Jesse Rogers wrote a controversial piece yesterday</a> for which the title says it all: &#8220;Bryant Should Be Cubs&#8217; Starting 3B in 2014.&#8221; In the piece, Rogers argues just that about Cubs prospect Kris Bryant, who was drafted in June, and was just promoted from short-season low-A ball to High-A this week. Pointing to Bryant&#8217;s early success, lack of huge holes in his swing, and ability to take walks, Rogers says that Bryant should be able to win the third base job out of Spring Training for the Cubs, given their obvious need there. I&#8217;ll credit Rogers for making a bold argument, and offering a lengthy piece in support of that argument. Too often, writers will throw out controversial bits just to drum up attention/clicks/discussion, and won&#8217;t even bother to offer any kind of rationale for the position. Rogers isn&#8217;t doing that. If you read the article, he makes his point, and then he goes through a wide variety of supporting arguments (including taking on some of the obvious counterarguments). Rogers even acknowledges that he&#8217;s going out on a limb a bit. I don&#8217;t agree with Rogers in a number of ways on this one, but I don&#8217;t think he was just trying to get attention.</li>
<li>That all said, I just don&#8217;t see any way that Bryant breaks camp with the Cubs. Setting aside the unlikelihood of jumping from High-A to the majors &#8211; and doing so in the players first full professional season &#8211; there are roster and service time considerations at play that would likely outweigh any thoughts that Bryant might be so much better than the other third base options that he just has to start in April. Primarily, if the Cubs keep Bryant down at least a month, they&#8217;ll get an extra year of control over him (in his prime), the value of which is extremely hard to quantify. If the Cubs keep him down until at least mid-season, he&#8217;ll likely not qualify for Super Two (and an expensive extra year of arbitration). No one wants to publicly talk about those considerations, but they are legitimate. I think the earliest we see Bryant with the Cubs is mid-2014, and even that would require him coming on like a freight train.</li>
<li>If the Cubs do not even consider pursuing any third basemen this offseason (and I don&#8217;t expect them to), it could be a signal that the Cubs expect Bryant (or Mike Olt, or Javier Baez) to be up with the big club <em>at some point </em>in 2014. In the interim, they could continue with a Luis Valbuena/someone else platoon (maybe bringing back Donnie Murphy or Cody Ransom on the cheap).</li>
<li><a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=9568792" target="_blank">Keith Law with Jason McLeod on his podcast</a>? Yeah, that&#8217;s *must* listen. One big &#8220;news&#8221; piece that came out of the interview: the Cubs are planning on having Arodys Vizcaino pitch in the &#8220;fall league,&#8221; which I take to mean the Arizona Fall League, as opposed to instructional ball. That would be awesome, and would set the Cubs up to be able to really evaluate where he&#8217;s at in terms of game-readiness, heading into 2014. Vizcaino, you&#8217;ll recall, was on his way back from Tommy John surgery this past year when he suffered a setback that forced him to have a second elbow procedure, and caused him to miss the season.</li>
<li>Matt Guerrier won&#8217;t be back with the Cubs this season, but <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/cubs/post/_/id/19200/guerrier-to-seek-second-opinion-on-forearm" target="_blank">he&#8217;s getting a second opinion</a> on his torn flexor mass (it&#8217;s a forearm thing) before getting surgery, which would put him out six to eight months. He&#8217;s a candidate to return to the Cubs next year on a minor league deal.</li>
<li>Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/cubs/post/_/id/19210/rizzo-castro-still-looking-for-answers" target="_blank">continue to struggle</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/08/14/baffoe-this-is-the-year-of-the-cubes/" target="_blank">Tim Baffoe interviews</a> the creators of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/facebookcubs" target="_blank">FacebookCubs</a>, which, in case you didn&#8217;t know, brought us the beautiful &#8220;#Cubes.&#8221;</li>
<li>Alfonso Soriano has four homers and 13 RBI in his last two games with the Yankees. In the process, he raised his OPS by 44 points. Good for him.</li>
<li>The Los Angeles Dodgers have won 40 of their last 48 games. That is *insane.*</li>
<li>MLB owners <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/08/14/mlb-close-to-decision-on-replay-expansion/2657957/" target="_blank">could decide today</a> on an all-encompassing instant replay system, which would kick in for 2014. It would include the ability to review <em>all </em>plays except balls and strikes. This would obviously be huge news, so we&#8217;ll be on the lookout.</li>

<p>My Tennessee vacation is over. I have returned to my home (and my regular job) in Maryland after a very pleasant eight hour drive.</p>
<p>And while I was on the road I missed one of the greatest plays in all of sports.</p>
<p>I have been watching or listening on the radio for a lot of home runs, including McGwire&#8217;s historic shot in 1998. I have seen or heard some triple plays, and was even in the stands when <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/piefe01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Felix Pie</a></strong> started one from the warning track in center one evening in Nashville. I have listened to no-hitters and marathon games, pitchers hitting grand slams and sluggers beating out bunt singles. Name the play and I have probably either seen it or listened live as Pat Hughes described it.</p>
<p>Except for the steal of home.</p>
<p>In my book a straight steal of home is pretty much the pinnacle of sports. Basketball has nothing to compare with it (and I say that as a Hoosier raised on that sport). Football offers the 109+ yard kickoff return, or possibly a well executed fake punt, but I think both fall short in terms of total epicness. Hockey, soccer, tennis, curling&#8230; all the other second tier sports come up short. The straight steal of home is among the rarest plays in the game. It is one of the toughest. It is one of the most unexpected. It is among the most exciting. It is among the most stunning.</p>
<p>And it is the play <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=alcant003ari&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Arismendy Alcantara</a></strong> completed last night. Twenty four hours earlier and I would have been in the park to see it. Fortunately, even though I missed it live, we can all enjoy it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8vfv06s8k0&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUQ5HBWbe_N57Z5BEJQna1-g" target="_blank">via YouTube, thanks to the Tennessee Smokies</a>. It&#8217;s only 15 seconds long, so don&#8217;t feel guilty about watching that clip seven or eight times in a row. I did. Boom:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/w8vfv06s8k0" height="298" width="530" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>And so my quest continues. One day I will finally witness, live, in person or otherwise, a steal of home. In the meantime I can watch Alcantara and ponder what might have been had I been able to stay in the mountains just one day longer.</p>
<p><strong>Scores From Yesterday</strong></p>
<p>This is the last day of the vacation-shortened single page links. The usual game scores will be back next week. For now, though, box scores and recaps are just an extra click away <a href="http://www.milb.com/scoreboard/index.jsp?sid=milb&amp;org=112&amp;ymd=20130814" target="_blank">from this page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/vittejo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Josh Vitters</a></strong> <a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2013/08/14/josh-vitters-heading-back-to-the-disabled-list/article" target="_blank">is again injured</a> and possibly on his way back to the disabled list, and that is a significant disappointment. He only recently reached the 100 plate appearances plateau for the season, and his numbers are quite good. His line currently reads .295/.380/.511 with 11 walks and 19 strikeouts. Roughly a third of his hits have gone for extra bases, including 4 doubles and 5 homers. Those are good numbers. Even with these injuries, I think Vitters could be a factor in the battle for the Chicago left field job next spring &#8230; if he&#8217;s still with the organization.</li>
<li>Speaking of players who will be getting a long look in spring training, as of last night <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=baez--000jav&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Javier Baez</a></strong>&#8216;s page on Baseball Reference had the following numbers: .274/.333/.575 with 47 strikeouts in 159 plate appearances. When I turn those figures into a K%, I get 29.5597%. That places Baez under 30% for his Double A season, and the trend line is still downwards. I do not think he will open the year in Chicago, but I suspect he will arrive on the North Side sometime in the middle of the 2014 season.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=bryant001kri&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Kris Bryant</a></strong> has also been drawing a lot of speculation lately, but I do not see any way the Cubs vault him from Daytona to Chicago in one winter. I&#8217;m not yet convinced he will even start next year in Tennessee, and that would almost be a requirement for Bryant to arrive in Chicago in 2014. For now I still have the slugging third baseman arriving about a year behind Baez, at best.</li>
<li>And that, in turn, could give the Cubs a chance to look at <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/oltmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Mike Olt</a></strong> in the second half of next year. Yes, the same Mike Olt who has an OPS of just .479 for Iowa. That is not the important number with this guy. We know from his career rates that Olt can draw walks and hit for power; those skills are not really in question. His problem was making contact. Through 76 Plate Appearances his K% is only 26.3% with Iowa. Given his power, that is an acceptable (if still a little high) rate for Triple A. We do not want to ignore the rest of his season, but progress is progress. Olt should be among the young Cubs under scrutiny in Arizona in the spring.</li>
<li>Something to get on your calendar now for the (minor league) offseason: Kane County is hosting a Craft Beer Fest on Saturday afternoon, September 21 from Noon until 4 p.m. at Fifth Third Bank Ballpark. Tickets, including special VIP packages are now on sale <a href="https://www2.ticketreturn.com/prod2/BuyNew.asp?EventID=97480">here</a>, or you can purchase at the Cougars&#8217; box office during business hours or by calling the Cougars at (630) 232-8811. The 21-and-over event also has a designated driver package with unlimited soda and water as well. You can see more details on the delicious-sounding event <a href="http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130627&amp;content_id=51942086&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_t446&amp;sid=t446" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

<p>In completely and totally unrelated news, pitcher Jake Arrieta will be coming back to join the Cubs on Friday, when he&#8217;ll start against the Cardinals. He&#8217;ll be taking the rotation spot of Carlos Villanueva, who heads back to the bullpen. I&#8217;ll have more thoughts on that move soon, but the short version is that I tend to like it, heading into the offseason.</p>

In doing so, the Cubs spent nearly $8 million to bring in Eloy Jimenez, Gleyber Torres, Jefferson Mejia, Erling Moreno, and Yohan Matos, in addition to Tseng (and likely a number of other lower-profile, less-expensive guys).</p>
<p>That $8 million spending spree easily blew through the Cubs&#8217; international spending allotment, even after the organization added some pool money in trades on July 2. Blowing the budget will subject the Cubs to a 100% tax on the overage (so the total payout is going to top $10 million), and will prohibit them from spending more than $250,000 on any one player in next year&#8217;s international class. When you consider how harsh the penalties are for blowing the budget in the Draft, the Cubs are getting off light.</p>
<p>And that was the plan all along, according to President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein, who recently laid out the Cubs&#8217; approach to international free agency this year. You can read Epstein&#8217;s explanation <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/cubs/post/_/id/19179/epstein-international-market-is-strong" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130813&amp;content_id=56866422&amp;notebook_id=56866426&amp;vkey=notebook_chc&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/sports/inside-the-cubs/epstein-cash-strapped-cubs-exploit-international-market/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/cubs/theo-cubs-pick-their-spots-spend-internationally" target="_blank">here</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Epstein, who referred to the approach as &#8220;a loophole we could run through and exploit,&#8221; explained that the Cubs liked the big-time targets available in this year&#8217;s class, and felt the penalties for blowing the budget were minimal. The Cubs had an opportunity to use money to acquire young talent beyond what most other teams were going to be able to do, and the Cubs took advantage.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar, it could be because Epstein&#8217;s explanation for the Cubs&#8217; approach mirrors <a title="Loopholing an Explanation for the Cubs’ International Spending Approach" href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2013/07/04/loopholing-an-explanation-for-the-cubs-international-spending-approach/">the one I hypothesized in early July</a> when it started to become clear that the Cubs were targeting more big-dollar youngsters than their international spending pool would allow. That lengthy piece &#8211; which even includes &#8220;loophole&#8221; right there in the title &#8211; describes the Cubs&#8217; probable approach, and explains why the Cubs (in particular) doing it this year (in particular) makes a lot of sense.*</p>
<p>Epstein echoed those sentiments, right down to the lack of an international draft in 2014 (and <a title="It’s Official: No International Draft for 2014, and Increased Spending Penalties" href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2013/05/31/its-official-no-international-draft-for-2014-and-increased-spending-penalties/">the &#8220;poison pill&#8221; of harsher penalties</a> kicking in if you overspend <em>next</em> year) being a factor. Epstein even confirmed that the trade of Roni Torreyes for international pool space was not about staying under the cap, but was instead about saving some actual money (every dollar of pool space the Cubs acquired reduced their tax bill by a dollar).</p>
<p>So, the plan all along was as we suspected it was: blow the budget (acquiring pool space where possible to save a little money on superfluous pieces), target the biggest names, take your (minor) lumps next year. Now we&#8217;ll see if the other aspect of the theory &#8211; the ability to trade pool slots next year for additional young talent &#8211; will play out. Epstein says the Cubs will target lesser players (since they can&#8217;t spend more than $250,000 on any one player), and they very well might. But if they can use a big pool slot to acquire a stateside talent? They just might do that.</p>
<p>*<em>All credit goes to the front office on discovering and taking advantage of the loophole. I merely deduced a possible explanation for what they were doing after they&#8217;d already started doing it. Yes, there&#8217;s a little bit of back-patting going on here, but mostly just to fully lay out the international approach to those who&#8217;d not yet seen it.</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Onto a related, but separate matter &#8230;</p>
<p>Overspending on international amateurs this year was at least partly tied to the organization&#8217;s present inability to spend huge dollars in free agency, according to Epstein (though I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be the first to say that they loved being able to freely spend internationally regardless). Here&#8217;s what Epstein told the media, the quotes being available at the links above (this particular version comes from <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130813&amp;content_id=56866422&amp;notebook_id=56866426&amp;vkey=notebook_chc&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Cubs.com</a>):</p>
<p>&#8220;That [international] market, you&#8217;re talking $1 million here, $1 million there, and that&#8217;s the type of thing we can afford. Right now, we&#8217;re not in a position to throw around hundreds of millions of dollars in free agency, but we can do it in that [international] market and try to monopolize it as much as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>That comment, designed to highlight the Cubs&#8217; laudable international approach, is likely to set off some anger alarms among some of you who&#8217;ve meticulously documented the Cubs&#8217; rapidly falling payroll over the last three years. For you folks, the &#8220;we can afford [$1 million here, $1 million there]&#8221; piece, and the &#8220;we&#8217;re not in a position to throw around hundreds of millions of dollars in free agency&#8221; piece will scream &#8220;cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, since you&#8217;re already on that side of the fence, little I say here will change your mind, so you might consider checking out.</p>
<p>For those who like their language heavily-parsed, however, let me know a number of things that, to me, underscore that Epstein isn&#8217;t really saying much of anything here.</p>
<p>First, and most obviously, Epstein said &#8220;right now&#8221; the Cubs can&#8217;t be spending &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars.&#8221; The international spending that predicated the entire discussion was for the 2013 budget year. So, when Epstein says the Cubs can&#8217;t be spending huge free agent sums &#8220;right now,&#8221; well, we already knew that. The current message has consistently been that the Cubs can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t spend big until the Wrigley Field renovation plan is fully in place (it&#8217;s not yet) and the new TV deal for the WGN portion of the games is negotiated (it hasn&#8217;t been). So, whether you think that financial approach is right or wrong, there is nothing new here.</p>
<p>Epstein, who chooses his public words carefully, also said hundreds (plural) of millions of dollars. On its face, that&#8217;s a, &#8220;well, I mean, yeah. I agree&#8221; kind of thing. The Cubs should almost never be throwing around hundreds of millions of dollars in a single year. Even if the Cubs were spending as robustly as some think their financial situation should allow them, I doubt they&#8217;d have enough to commit hundreds (plural) of millions of dollars &#8211; especially &#8220;right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>($100 million contracts are rarely a good investment anyway, especially in free agency. Epstein has always maintained that kind of an attitude since coming to the Cubs, so, once again, there&#8217;s nothing here to get too riled up about. The Cubs did try to drop $75 million on Anibal Sanchez this Winter, after all. For the right players and the right risks, the money is probably already there.)</p>
<p>You also always have to keep in mind that there is a layer of gamesmanship involved any time the Cubs publicly discuss spending on the organization. Not only does it impact their future free agent negotiations, but, we can&#8217;t forget: there&#8217;s still a stadium renovation to be finalized. Yes, City Council has approved the bulk of the renovation, <a title="Obsessive Wrigley Renovation Watch: Sheffield Patio Deck Could Be Key to Two Problems" href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2013/08/01/obsessive-wrigley-renovation-watch-sheffield-patio-deck-could-be-key-to-two-problems/">but there are still kinks to be worked out</a>. Kinks that could probably be addressed by the heavy hand of a motivated city. Reminding everyone that the Cubs can&#8217;t truly open up the checkbook until the renovation situation is squared away doesn&#8217;t hurt, and is very much &#8220;on message.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Epstein is going to be throwing ownership under the bus any time soon, so you have to read comments like this one through a lens that the baseball operations folks and the business operations folks are working together. &#8220;Right now&#8221; the large revenue streams that are expected to support a large market payroll are not in place. Coordinating with that message, the Cubs are in the middle of an organizational overhaul &#8211; the kind that necessarily lends itself to spending a lot less on the big league team.</p>
<p>When the time is right to spend big, and the right players are available, I still believe the front office will be given the resources it needs. It could come as soon as the next year or two &#8211; that marks the confluence of the revenue streams coming online, as well as the young core theoretically emerging into the building block of a competitive roster.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MDGonzales/status/367660388927565824" target="_blank">Mark Gonzales just reported</a> that Jacob Hannemann, the Cubs&#8217; third round pick out of BYU, has a slight tear in his right (non-throwing) elbow. Hannemann missed most of July at short season low-A Boise with an undisclosed injury, came back for a few games at the end of the month, and hasn&#8217;t played since July 25. I am wondering if this elbow injury is new (since July 25, anyway), or if it was the issue all along. The 22-year-old center fielder was hitting .290/.313/.468 for Boise over just 14 games.</p>
<p>The injury, which will not require surgery (but still figures to keep Hannemann out for the better part of the rest of the year), is particularly ill-timed, <a title="God’s Wrath Watch: Jorge Soler Not Expected Back This Minor League Season" href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2013/08/14/gods-wrath-watch-jorge-soler-not-expected-back-this-minor-league-season/">not unlike Jorge Soler&#8217;s injury</a>. Like Soler, Hannemann hasn&#8217;t played a whole lot of baseball in the last few years, having served a Mormon mission before starting at BYU. He hit quite well there this year as a freshman, but, because of the layoff, you&#8217;d like to see him getting in as much action as possible right now. Further, because he&#8217;s already 22, you&#8217;d also probably have preferred to see him reach full season ball by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Cubs clearly liked Hannemann a great deal, taking him at the start of the third round this year, and paying him well over slot ($1 million) to sign. Hopefully he can play in instructional ball this Fall, or maybe even a Winter League. Either way, he&#8217;ll remain a prospect to watch next year.</p>
<p>(UPDATE: I don&#8217;t have it in my heart to blast you with three consecutive bits of Wrath, but Josh Vitters reinjured his woeful hamstring, per Tommy Birch, and may have to go back on the DL. Again again again.)</p>
