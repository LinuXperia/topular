<p><strong><a href="http://www.madisonmaxey.com/" target="_blank">Maddy Maxey</a>: Thiel Fellow, Fashion Designer, Technology Entrepreneur.</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.patternindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/madison-maxeyimage2.jpg" rel='prettyPhoto'><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6734" alt="madison-maxeyimage2" src="http://www.patternindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/madison-maxeyimage2.jpg" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Maddy, obviously you’ve had a lot of experience in the fashion industry – everything from producing your own line to blogging and attending fashion shows. Tell us a little bit about your blazer line, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madisonmaxeyblazers/madison-maxey-blazers-building-a-brand-in-365-days" target="_blank">Madison Maxey</a> – what were some of your big takeaways? And, how did attending Parsons and your early career in fashion design lead you to your current projects in technology? </strong></p>
<p>I started the blazer company when I was 18 and I was so in over my head. I had no idea what I was doing – but I learned and I grew as a person in ways I hadn’t previously imagined possible. Above all, I learned how to balance life and work and how to be self directed. I would recommended starting a business to anyone who wants an immense challenge and who wants to get to know themselves better.</p>
<p>Parsons is a fantastic school, but unfortunately was not a great fit for me. However, if I didn’t leave school, I never would have started my own business and it was truly entrepreneurship that brought me into the technology space. I realized that I would never be independent if I didn’t learn programming and even more so, I realized that technology is a fantastic industry that provides opportunities that fashion simply cannot.</p>
<p><strong>How is your <a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/" target="_blank">Thiel Fellowship </a>project–technology for manufacturers to ensure better fitting clothes–coming along? What have you learned so far? </strong></p>
<p>The Thiel Fllowship project is making great progress and we’re excited to dig deeper into the research when I return to NY and can work with Mari in person. We’re currently keeping details of the project under wraps, but are looking for sponsorship for our research!</p>
<p><strong>Your newest project, <a href="http://thecrated.com/" target="_blank">CRATED</a>, sounds awesome! Tell us a little bit about how it came about and the team behind it. What are your plans for it?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://thecrated.com/" target="_blank">CRATED</a> is a multifaceted project, featuring a front facing digital content site for user engagement and a fashion and technology lab in order to lead innovation in the garment manufacturing process. We focus primarily on research in textile and pattern manipulation and are currently developing our pilot product- MELD. MELD is an B2B solution that aims to revolutionize the garment manufacturing process.</p>
<p><strong>What would you consider to be your “big break?”</strong></p>
<p>I think my big break was when I was 16 and started a fashion blog in France that took my co-founder and I to fashion shows and events in Berlin and Paris as press. This moment was absolutely pivotal as it made me realize that rules can be broken and that the sky is the limit if you’re willing to work hard and dream big.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any words of wisdom for young or recent entrepreneurs and designers out there, in fashion, tech, or fashion tech? </strong></p>
<p>I would say that anyone who aspires to make an impact must know that they are capable of absolutely anything. You can learn to program, learn about textiles, learn how to pitch to VCs – even learn smaller things like how to cook to souffle  &#8211; if you believe that you can and if you put the time and effort into it.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a strategy or tactic that’s working really well for you right now? </strong></p>
<p>Go forth with confidence. I’ve noticed that when ideas and plans are presented with a sense of confidence, everyone is more inspired – including yourself.</p>
<p><strong>What is your guiding principle for design?</strong></p>
<p>A touch of whimsicality is essential for every design I create. It’s important to me that there’s a bit of wonder in everything, whether that be a unique color palette or a surprising silhouette.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for you? </strong></p>
<p>I feel as though the future can be best described as adventuring into the land of rule breaking. I’m not sure what’s next but it’s going to be something great and hopefully involve experimentation in textiles and patternmaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://marikussman.com/" target="_blank">Mari Kussman</a>: Fashion Designer, Co-Founder of Crated</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.patternindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HEADSHOT.png" rel='prettyPhoto'><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6735" alt="HEADSHOT" src="http://www.patternindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HEADSHOT-276x300.png" width="336" height="360" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mari, You have done some really great work with 3D printing. Why did you choose to work in this new medium? What have you learned about it? Why jewelry?</strong></p>
<p>While putting together the inspiration for the <a href="http://www.kimberlyovitz.com/" target="_blank">Kimberly Ovitz</a> <a href="http://www.kimberlyovitz.com/runway/fall2013" target="_blank">Fall 2013 season</a>, we were drawing a lot of inspiration from “natural defense mechanisms”. This meant poisonous frogs, microscale views of venom, and exoskeletons. Seeing as the inspiration for the collection was nature, it was almost uncomfortable to not attempt a “zero waste” approach. 3D printing was the obvious choice and had been on my radar for some time.</p>
<p>I have since learned that 3D printing is still in its infancy, despite all of the hype- there is so much further to go! The list of printable materials is expanding rapidly, and the possibilities for consumer engagement through customization are endless.</p>
<p><strong>Did you work with <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>? What was that like? How did you choose your partners?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.shapeways.com/" target="_blank">Shapeways</a> was our collaborator in this particular jewelry collection. They are extremely accommodating and easy to work with. Through their forums, designers and 3D modellers can connect to work on projects together. This way, a designer at any skill level is able to hire a modeller to execute their design. For our collaboration we worked with an very talented architect <a href="https://twitter.com/kspaho" target="_blank">Kostika Spaho</a>, who has received a great deal of press through his early collaborations in 3D printed shoes.</p>
<p><strong>How does your interest in fashion tech play into your role at Kimberly Ovitz, and/or past ones at Helmut Lang, Alvin Valley, and Chado Ralph Rucci?</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is interesting as I would say that my interest in innovation is reactionary to what I experienced in contemporary garment manufacturing. There are so many possibilities for automation in the fashion industry that have not at all been explored, which would not only allow for designers to concentrate more on designing, but increase the efficiency in the concept to landing products as well as generate humane factory working conditions.</p>
<p><strong>What would you consider to be your “big break?”</strong></p>
<p>Oddly enough, I think this would be my early experience working as an assistant perfumer to <a href="http://cbihateperfume.com/" target="_blank">Christoper Brosius</a> of “CB I hate perfume”. Christopher was a great influence on my life, as his passion was to create “experiential perfumes”. This meant tapping into the most primal sense we have as humans: the olfactory bulb, which can evoke the most visceral memories. I learned through this experience the importance of a product feeling personal and the intimacy of customization which is the big picture trajectory of <a href="http://thecrated.com/" target="_blank">CRATED</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What excites you about working at the intersection of fashion and technology?</strong></p>
<p>EVERYTHING. Ahem. Though truthfully, it is the confluence of my greatest passions merged into one. There is a tendency to assume that caring about the way that you look is materialistic, though we all wear clothes and make these daily aesthetic decisions. Why is it that we are not using this medium to communicate our specific ideologies as well as diversity through customization?</p>
<p><strong>What does the future of your field look like?</strong></p>
<p>I would hope that we can begin to confront the issues of image vs. reality. This pertains to brand vanity sizing, photoshopping to unrealistic ideals of beauty etc. We should also be striving for sustainably-produced, longer-lasting products with attainable price points.</p>
<p><strong>What is your guiding principle for design?</strong></p>
<p>Is it timeless? Is it inclusionary? Does it contribute to the dialogue of culture?</p>
<p><em><a href="http://technologyfashiondesign.splashthat.com/" target="_blank">Join us on August 29th</a> to catch Maddy’s keynote and a panel with Maddy, Mari, and more as we celebrate and learn from the intersection of technology, fashion and design.</em></p>

<p><strong>MD: How would you describe your “style?”</strong></p>
<p>Lindsay: I think it’s like “Punky Brewster chic.” Patterns, interesting earrings and definitely a lot of color. I’ve always liked color. If I look back at my 2nd grade pictures I think I still wear the same color palettes. I’m also very frugal. I love finding things at Forever 21 and then having someone say they love my necklace. It’s like,“Yes!!”</p>
<p><strong>You’re an Art Director at an advertising agency, what does that mean exactly?</strong></p>
<p>My grandma would say I make things pretty. It’s basically taking strategy and making it look good. Finding the right illustrator or photographer for a job. Carrying on the look of a campaign. Making sure everything is cohesive and keeping the look fresh. Part of my job is to soak in as much cool design as possible, put that in a martini glass, and shake it up.</p>
<p><strong>Pick three famous people dead or alive that you would like to model your style after?</strong></p>
<p>I love Michelle Williams and her funky hair do. I like Maggie Gyllenhaal. She always has artsy items on, and her hair is always messed up- I like that. Maybe I just want to go shopping with Tina Fey. We will go to Target and drink a soda.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of clothing do you like to wear the least?</strong></p>
<p>Shorts. Fitted Suits. I’m an A-line skirt kind of girl. Just cinch the waist and cover things up.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you shop for clothes?</strong></p>
<p>Everywhere. I might go to Kate Spade and then a thrift store on the same trip. One of the best dresses I ever bought was from a vintage shop. People go nuts over that and its Montgomery Ward from 1978. My mom actually sews a lot of my dresses.</p>
<p><strong>What does style mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>It’s an extension of yourself. Somebody might look at me and say, “I bet you do something creative.” I think it’s about how inviting you are. Do you wear clothes that make people want to talk to you, or make you seem interesting?</p>
<p><strong>You can pick one outfit that would forever be identified as your “look” to the world&#8230;describe it in detail.</strong></p>
<p>A little sleeved A-line dress, bright green or blue. Big earrings. Always wedge shoes. I’m short, so I want to get the advantage of posture.</p>
<p><strong>What is the fashion or style mistake you see that drives you crazy?</strong></p>
<p>I think that women buy clothes according the number and not to what actually fits. I know you want to squeeze into an 8, but you would look better in a 12 and that is Ok.</p>
<p><strong>What is most important to you when selecting clothing for yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I think you just feel good in things. When you put on a dress you just want to twirl.</p>
<p><strong>What music do you like listening to when getting ready?</strong></p>
<p>Is NPR music? (Laughs) That’s usually what it is. But if I was going to psych myself up before going out. I always listen to The Girl From Ipanema. It’s my favorite song in the whole world. My best friend made me a mixed tape of covers of that song&#8230;I have two volumes!</p>
<p><strong>Fashion trend that you want to start?</strong></p>
<p>I want to start a Steve Martin trend, I guess. I love that he&#8217;s always worn a suit for both his standup and banjo gigs. Maybe that&#8217;s the trend I&#8217;d like to see: people dressing up. Caring a little bit more. Put one part Mad Men, one part Steve Martin, and one part Kate Spade in a shaker and make it available at Target prices. Nice, but not too stiff, and fun. Maybe I just want everyone to look like they&#8217;ve just come from a neighborhood dance in West Side Story, staged by the Gap.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe the style of Indianapolis?</strong></p>
<p>Depends on which neighborhood you’re in. You could go to Fountain Square and think this is a hipster city or to the north side and think hey this place is a little buttoned up. I think we are doing better. We are a pretty tasteful city.</p>

No more &#8220;Me Generation.&#8221; No more &#8220;kids these days.&#8221; Gen Y, the business world has finally figured it out. You are important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Those born after 1980 are a key demographic for nonprofits and other businesses. But how does a company successfully communicate its message to Millennials? </span></p>
<h1>Why should I care about connecting with Millennials?</h1>
<p>Here is the thing, fashion creatives. Many brands are targeting and trying to figure out how to tap into the passion, connectivity, and disposable income of the age group. Those grouped in the Millennial generation are characterized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 12.986111640930176px;">Connected through technology</span></li>
<li>Influential in their networks</li>
<li>Looking to have an impact</li>
</ul>
<p>Like any business move, getting Millenials excited your brand takes thought. Businesses can&#8217;t just operate under the mindset of, &#8220;If we build it they will come.&#8221; Industry professionals have to be in the position that they are actively making the right business decisions.  Being attractive to Millennials can be a huge win for your business and for your organization.</p>
<p>Millennials have proved that they are fantastic at sharing your story, solidifying your brand message, and amplifying your content. This alone is a goldmine for a brand that doesn&#8217;t have the budget to pay for a traditional marketing campaign.</p>
<h1>It is not you. It is me.</h1>
<p>This is probably very true.</p>
<p>The first concept that was repeated regularly at the conference is the importance of building a <strong>RELATIONSHIP </strong>with Millennials. This, like all relationships, is going to be a struggle and take a lot of work and energy. Don&#8217;t even think about faking your love for the Millennials. They can smell fake. The biggest way to beat a lot of the larger business at getting the coveted age group on your side is to be authentic and transparent in the way you handle your business. One you have their trust, they are brand loyal.</p>
<p>Building a relationship with Millennials means you better be active and diverse in your use of technology in your brand.<em> The Millennial Impact Research Report</em> found that 83% of Millennials have smartphones. Is your website, email, and social media mobile friendly. Research also found that &#8220;More than 60% of respondents liked it most when nonprofits shared stories about successful projects or the people they help.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are not a non-profit, then does your brand have an impact beyond just selling a product or service? How does your website look? Do you make it easy for people to connect through social media on your site? When Millennials visit a site, &#8220;51% connect via social media, 46% donated to the cause, 46% read a blog post,&#8221; stated the report.</p>
<p>Having a usable mobile presence, a compelling story, and a clear and focused website is the foundation for a relationship with the Millennial generation. Having a good relationship comes in handy when launching that campaign to raise funds for your non-profit or to kickoff your Kickstarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;83% of Millennial respondents made a financial gift to an organization in 2012,&#8221; mentions the report, with most giving between $1 and $50. Other estimates put it around 75%. Either way&#8211; Millennials are hardly the apathetic crowd they&#8217;re sometimes made out to be. But when asking for backers for a campaign or donation, you better have built a relationship through inspiration, monthly giving, transparency, and peer-to-peer engagement.</p>
<h1>As an entrepreneur, why do I care about any of this?</h1>
<p>I posed the question above to Alia McKee from Sea Change, Jessica Mason from YouTube. Professionals of any age can take a few cues from Millennials. Want to advance your career? Think like it&#8217;s 2013, not 1993.</p>
<p>Hey photographers, videographers, and graphic designers! Alia McKee can get us a job. How? The non-profit world might not be the first thing creatives think of when trying to sell their services. However, with the push towards marketing non-profits to Millennials, they are transitioning into a more visual approach. No, you might not be shooting the fashion campaign you were hoping to for, but you are building your experience and getting paid. Think outside of the box on how you are going to work in Indianapolis. There are some great non-profits around the city.</p>
<p>Jessica Mason manages the Youtube for Good team. I talked to her about how YouTube and video can be a huge and often inexpensive opportunity to get your message and brand out there. And gone are the days of sinking ample time and funds into professionally-produced video marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>According to Mason, YouTube is more about getting a significant quantity of video out regularly and not necessarily about producing super high quality. [<em>Editor's note: Your content should always be worth consuming-- well-thought out, well-composed, and attention-grabbing. It just doesn't need to be slick.</em>]</p>
<p>Mason couldn&#8217;t even count the number of videos she&#8217;s watched in her career at YouTube, but she can absolutely remember the good ones. An iPhone video with a good message can change the world. YouTube is a story telling mechanism; viewers are not just going to YouTube for short content. How are you telling your story?</p>
<p>You know, I could talk about Digital Media Communication and the Millennial engagement a lot longer. Feel free to stop by #BinderyIndy on Thursdays and we can chat.</p>

[For more on Indy co-working, check out Pattern's pop up design co-working space, <a href="http://www.patternindy.com/the-bindery/" target="_blank">The Bindery</a>!]</em></p>
<p>The difference between a co-working space and an incubator (discussed in our <a title="Indy’s Incubator Dream: What is Co-Working?" href="http://www.patternindy.com/2013/07/10/indys-incubator-dream-what-is-co-working/">first article of this series</a>) is subtle, but important. Both are all the rage in the business world right now as they bring unprecedented levels of cross-industry collaboration and innovation, but incubators also fulfill a special role that co-working spaces do not. The idea behind the name &#8220;incubator&#8221; is that a start-up company receives not only the tools of the trade that they need to succeed (that a co-working space can provide), but also funding and long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Incubators usually charge companies for space and resources, and in turn, walk the startup through its beginning stages with an expectation of a return of the profits once the company is fully up and running. It&#8217;s a symbiotic relationship that has proven to work across the country in many different cities. This isn&#8217;t the only sustainable model however, as evidenced by <a href="http://www.techstars.com/" target="_blank">TechStars</a>, who don&#8217;t  classify themselves as a traditional incubator.</p>
<p>&#8220;We define Techstars as an accelerator more than an incubator,&#8221; Clare Tischer, communication manager for TechStars, said. &#8220;Incubators typically charge the entrepreneur money whereas we offer them $18K in seed funding, an optional $100K convertible debt note and deep mentorship in exchange for 6% equity.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechStars is proficient at what they do. To date, 192 active businesses have completed their program and 20 have been acquired after getting on their feet. TechStars has multiple sites in cities across the country, and each one of those cities has seen a boost in their economy. TechStars alone has created almost 1,700 jobs across the country through their program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see our three month program as a condensed version of the first year of your company, accelerated to fail fast, iterate, succeed, and built for speed,&#8221; Tischer said. Success to TechStars is &#8220;Profitable, happy companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Profitable, happy companies starting and thriving in the heart of Indianapolis is the ultimate end point on the road that co-working spaces and incubators are starting. Places like the SpeakEasy are already well established, and hopefully there is room for other places such as The Bindery to open and thrive, as well. One of TechStars&#8217; founders, Brad Feld, said that a long-term vision, entrepreneurial leaders, fresh meat and engaging activities are all needed to keep a sustainable entrepreneurial environment going. It has to keep going, though, as one cycle isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to build a community is to move beyond boom and bust and build something over extended periods of time,&#8221; Feld said.</p>
<p>Everything has to start somewhere, though, and Indianapolis&#8217; creative landscape is lacking structure. A co-working space for design creatives, The Bindery is going to be up and functional throughout the month of August to show the community that it can be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost, you have to let the community know that you are there,&#8221; Caressa Brown, CEO of the Dayton Emerging Fashion Incubator, said. &#8220;You can’t make it all about fashion, because fashion won’t attract the entire city.  You have to let the community know that there&#8217;s something in it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>With enough effort from entrepreneurs and design creatives around the country, maybe the Bindery can be the next TechStars, pumping out successful businesses that bring more jobs and economy to Indianapolis.</p>

That&#8217;s how I describe the free-flowing designs made by <a href="http://handjiveclothing.mybigcommerce.com/">Hand Jive</a>, a company based in Fort Wayne, IN that started 17 years ago by Dawn DeSanto in partnership with her friend Kenna Jackson. Both women were enthusiastic about fashion and especially loved shopping together. When they turned 40, they became frustrated by the matronly options afforded to them as &#8220;older women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to go to the junior department where the clothes looked so much more interesting and fun, but we had to go to the misses department to get a fit,” DeSanto said. As a visual artist who specializes in print-making, DeSanto waded into the fashion business almost by accident. Starting with what&#8217;s known in the fashion business as a “blank” (a ready-made garment that&#8217;s intended to be used as a canvas for some other design) DeSanto began embellishing the clothes she wore to dance and fitness classes with her own customized prints. &#8220;I&#8217;d wear something to class and people would ask, &#8216;Where did you get that?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her 16-year-old fine art business hit a plateau. As interest in her customized clothes grew, DeSanto began to scrutinize the blanks with a more critical eye. &#8220;I knew I could design cooler things than that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After getting serious about the idea of starting a fashion business, DeSanto and Jackson gathered their favorite clothes—the ones they grabbed when they needed to look good in a hurry—and analyzed what made them work. Shortly afterwards, they began making and selling their designs, joining a fashion movement that has become a popular new category of clothing: wearable art.</p>
<p>Although the clothes have evolved since the early 1990s, they are still made to flatter a mature figure—without looking matronly. &#8220;I loved the whole British Invasion influence on fashion, and sophisticated yet unstructured clothes,&#8221; DeSanto said. Although the clothes she makes today are more body-conscious than her earliest designs, they are made for real bodies. For example, Hand Jive sundresses and tank tops have wide straps that allow you to wear a regular bra. Tunics flow smoothly over hips without adding bulk.</p>
<p>DeSanto has no compunctions about using models that reflect Hand Jive’s customer base of women who are well north of 40. In fact, her strongest models are 68 and 73. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about filling this niche,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just because you&#8217;re middle-aged or older doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have funky, fun clothes. I think having older models signals to other women that you don&#8217;t have to choose between giving up or trying too hard with fashion.&#8221; DeSanto notes that there are plenty of younger women who enjoy the spunk found in the Hand Jive fashion vibe, which has a cross-generational following.</p>
<p>Hand Jive benefits from the fact that there are still surprisingly few options for mature women who want to wear fun, flattering clothes, even among brands that are supposedly targeted to that age group. &#8220;They are either too tidy and neat, or too pastel,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Hand Jive clothes are made in Fort Wayne, IN and sold online and at art shows around the country, mostly in the Midwest. &#8220;Because of my fine art business, I knew how to market that way, so it was a natural way for me to go about selling,” she said.</p>
<p>In addition to making a living, DeSanto feels blessed that Hand Jive has allowed her to spend quality time with two sons who sometimes travel with her to help load, set up and sell. During the prime summer sales season, DeSanto and Jackson frequently divide and conquer, covering more than one city in the same weekend. The majority of the shows are in the summer, which works perfectly for Jackson, a school psychologist who can&#8217;t travel during the school year.</p>
<p>When they do a show together, they are very strategic about what they wear, repeatedly proving that they are their own best models. &#8220;Whatever we wear, we will sell a lot of,&#8221; DeSanto said. The tunic that sold like hotcakes on Day One of an art festival will languish on the racks if they wear something else on Day Two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aside from the financial benefits, it has been really rewarding to hear someone say, ‘You know, I&#8217;ve gained 30 pounds and I was feeling so bad about myself because nothing fit. Thank you for making stuff that makes me feel good and flatters my body,’&#8221; DeSanto said.</p>
<p>If you visit their site, you will get genuinely fun updates on their <a href="http://handjiveclothing.mybigcommerce.com/pages/Show-Schedule.html">travels</a> and special deals (They call them Hot Flashes—a play on words that most of their customers can relate to). They also share cool video content on how to <a href="http://handjiveclothing.mybigcommerce.com/style-tips/">style</a> Hand Jive garments.</p>

<p>10-15 years ago, the terms &#8220;technology&#8221; and &#8220;Indianapolis&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t have seemed particularly connected. Fast forward to today, however, and you will find that companies like <a href="http://www.exacttarget.com/">ExactTarget Marketing</a>, <a href="http://www.chacha.com/">ChaCha </a>information service and <a href="http://www.formstack.com/">FormStack</a> have all blossomed right from this very city. Indy is now known as one of best cities for launching a tech startup. It just took a little bit of time and effort to get there.</p>
<p>Just announced last week by the Pattern team, the Bindery hopes to put in that same time and effort to create a creative space for fashion and design minded individuals in Indianapolis and make the Circle City a fashion destination like our tech friends started. Pattern sees the design community that it is cultivating in Indy where the technology group was a decade ago before local startups made it big. The success of these companies has opened the door for a discipline-specific co-working space, the Speak Easy, to help facilitate more technology startups in Indy. If you are looking to do tech in this day and age, a co-working space is the place to be. If tech can do it, why not design as well?</p>
<p>Cities like New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and Las Vegas all have spaces where members of the city and community can come and work to create and design fashion their way. However, you don&#8217;t need to be one of the top cities in the country to do this. Dayton, Ohio&#8217;s <a href="http://daytonemergingfashionincubator.com/">Emerging Fashion Incubator</a> (DE-FI) has taken on the challenge and showed that it can be done anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing that goes into starting an incubator is building a team that believes in the ultimate goal and vision of the organization and having open communication,&#8221; Caressa Brown said. She&#8217;s in charge of the incubator in Dayton that is pioneering the idea in a town that isn&#8217;t really known for its fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dayton was a huge manufacturing city, we had General Motors, we had Delphi, Chrysler, and DHL.  None of the companies are still here,&#8221; Brown said. Those companies&#8217; absence devastated the local economy but left behind the legacy of a manufacturing and textile industry. Brown said these factors in addition to Dayton&#8217;s central location to big cities like Indianapolis, Chicago, Detroit and others lead her to ask, &#8220;Why not start something here in Dayton?&#8221;</p>
<p>DE-FI also works with models to make sure that new models have the best experience they can in an industry that is riddled with scammers. They show that a fashion incubator can be more than just sewing machines and cutting tables. The DE-FI shows that this kind of initiative can be put together and accomplished in a city that isn&#8217;t on one of the coasts. The Bindery is looking to replicate that success with its pop-up location through the month of August. Bringing together the tools to create and design, the Bindery hopes to fill its space with creative people to show the city that this kind of community can be great for the city.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Bindery will become a permanent installation within Indianapolis still remains to be seen, but the city could benefit greatly from it. There are numerous incubators, co-working spaces and accelerators out there that have had wild success in producing and nurturing startups from ideas to complete businesses, which we will cover in our next article. What will it take for the Bindery to get to that point in Indianapolis?</p>

<p><strong>This book is kind of your own DIY project—How did you get involved with the DIY scene? What makes you see the world that way? Not everybody does.</strong></p>
<p>I think it comes from making zines in the late 90s and trading them with people all over the country. And it sounds cliché now, but when I moved to Portland, Oregon after high school, I saw people not only self-publishing but also building a community around that. Whether that was touring with their bands, or having secret cafes at their houses, or doing shows in their basements, I feel like it was really concentrated in Portland in the early 2000s. I worked with a group of zine makers in Portland to start the Portland Zine Symposium, which was weekend-long gathering of people trading and selling zines and also holding workshops and discussions about DIY and self-publishing culture. That’s what really shaped my feelings about the power of this culture, to see people come together from all over the country and all over the world to celebrate DIY. And I think moving forward, as I started my professional career working with art museums, I remember an employer asked me, “Can you plan an event on a small budget?” I said, “Well, I put on a weekend-long zine symposium on no budget. <em>It really showed me that you don’t have to sit around and wait for permission for something to happen. If you see a need in your community, and it seems like there is an audience for it, then you can make it happen.”</em></p>
<p><strong>DIY seems to have invaded the zeitgeist lately—you can’t walk ten feet without running into someone selling something homemade. Where do you think this do-it-yourself impulse is coming from?</strong></p>
<p>I think that we do see the rise of the handmade. Independent craft fairs are taking off. But things like state fairs and county fairs and church shows, where people are showcasing their homemade goods, have always been a big part of the culture. It was a big part of the culture I grew up in, so it doesn’t really surprise me when someone is selling homemade pickles or making pies or knitting pot holders. But I’d agree that now there is a hipper, slicker, more urban design element to it. I think there are a lot of reasons for this. With the internet, it’s easier for independent producers to open their products to a wider audience. You see websites like etsy making it easier for people to sell to a large audience, and template websites, and the Square app—all that gives people the means to push their product out there. But I also think with technology and mass production so prevalent in our lives, people want a genuine connection to things that somebody made. I think that’s because we spend so much time online, so much time at a desk job or a job that’s isolating us from making things, so much time in our cars, so much time in our own little bubble. People want to connect with products and other people and build a community. The technology makes that easier, but it’s also the thing that’s isolating us.</p>
<p><strong>Your book’s subtitle reads: “How to Take Your Do It Yourself Project and Passion to the Next Level and Quit Your Job.” Why should we quit our jobs? What about the current job climate lends itself to a DIY career?</strong></p>
<p>I think people should always be thinking about what makes them happy and what makes them feel rewarded, not just economically but emotionally and spiritually. I came of age professionally during the recession, and I went back to graduate school because I wanted to get a certain skill set that I didn’t have. What I thought was that getting that graduate degree would put me on a higher career path, and what I found is that’s not the case. And as I’ve been talking to people more and more, they’re agreeing that the safety net I thought a full-time job would give me isn’t there. I think sometimes we think that a full-time career path is the only way to go for economic security, but many people are finding that it is not. However, I think that [the DIY career] is more about having a flexible plan, finding a way to support many different parts of your life through your work.  For some people, maybe it’s not about your job; it can be about having a creative venture that’s sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>If you could boil a successful DIY business down into its crucial elements, what would you find?</strong></p>
<p>It sounds simple, but you really can’t do without a budget. A budget isn’t just about money—it’s about resources, and knowing what you have and what you need and what you might need in the future. The projects I see that aren’t successful happen when people are not clear on how much money and resources they need to support what they want to do. Successful projects have a balance between their income and their expenses. That doesn’t mean that the entrepreneur hasn’t invested a lot into his or her business, but it’s important to have a plan on how that money is going to come back based on real numbers.</p>
<p>The other most important element is audience. You can’t sell anything if you don’t know who you’re selling to or what exactly you’re selling.</p>
<p>And the thing I’ve been obsessed with lately is calculated risk. When people are thinking about quitting their jobs or starting businesses there’s always a risk. You should take a risk with the most knowledge you can—about your field, about your audience, about your economic situation. You’re going to set yourself up better to take a risk; you’ll learn and grow whether or not that business is successful.</p>

An Evansville native and Butler graduate, the 25 year old quadruple threat is designing a line of gender-neutral, portable, locally-sourced, and eco-friendly cosmetics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The product is a totally customizable multi tool designed for busy men and women with an artistic bent. Murrell describes her palette-esque product as “kind of like a passport. You arrange it how you like, and take it with you wherever you’re going. Then you can open it up and look at all the colors from a moment in time. It’s this really beautiful notion that you can have a souvenir of that season or that mood.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The brand’s marriage of high-quality pigments and high-fashion colors with unfussy application is a natural fit for the burgeoning Indy fashion scene. Like Pattern, Murrell says, her line “is selling an idea; it’s polished and fashion forward while still being accessible and inviting.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Accessible may be the perfect descriptor for Murrell’s upcoming line. Not only will it be designed and marketed with the currently underrepresented men’s demographic in mind (“It seems kind of last-century,” according to Murrell, “to see cosmetics as a female-only pursuit”), but it will also be available to the consumer at the click of the mouse. In addition to traditional retailers, Murrell is placing her line in the online marketplace. “It’s going to be incredibly useful for people on the go,” she says. “You won’t have to go to the mall to refill your expensive makeup. Even now, the cosmetics market is not set up for people who need to quickly shop and replace their products.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Sarah Murrell is not exactly one to idle in her downtime. When she’s not designing her cosmetic line, she writes a “Weird Beauty Ritual” column for the Indianapolis-based blog <a href="http://www.punchnels.com/author/sarah-murrell/">Punchnels</a>, creates and sells custom nail art on Etsy, and works as a freelance <a href="https://www.facebook.com/makeupbySM">makeup artist</a> and <a href="http://fixxfoto.com/FIXX/HOME.html">photographer</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
At the core of every project lies one addictive idea for Murrell: transformation. After she “borrowed” Kevyn Aucoin’s book <em>Making Faces</em> from her sister as a child, she was hooked on the possibilities makeup and photography held. “I was like the kid who sees a magic trick and then goes home and spends years learning how to recreate it,” she says. Fifteen years later, she shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

<p>If your first thought when hearing the word &#8220;incubator&#8221; had to do with a chicken and its eggs, don&#8217;t worry; you aren&#8217;t alone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the phrase &#8220;co-working&#8221; describes this new working craze better than incubator, but both of these new styles of collaborating are taking off. A challenge to white-collar jobs that corral workers in cubicles, this new style of workspace allows entrepreneurs and independent business people to drop in and out of the space when they see fit. This allows them to have an office when they need it and to bump elbows there with professionals from outside of their line of work, making for a creative space where work and collaboration overlap.</p>
<p>Incubators today have their roots in co-working and co-living spaces that have been around for years. In recent years, though, the industry has seen exponential growth. There were an estimated 1,320 different workspaces globally in 2012. This year, that number has rocketed up to over 2,000 different spaces that bring entrepreneurs under one roof to work and work off each other.</p>
<p>While co-working spaces are usually fairly flexible as far as who can rent space and work within their walls, incubators are a little more goal-oriented. Whereas co-working spaces usually allow anyone who can pay to keep their spot into the building, incubators accept applications and work through a acceptance process. Big name incubators like TechStars and Y-Combinator bring in the talent, work with them to develop their talents and business, and then grow them into full-fledged businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t reinventing the wheel, we&#8217;re just changing how the wheel is being used in a small market to make it more productive,&#8221; Caressa Brown said. She is the founder and CEO of the Dayton Emerging Fashion Incubator, an incubator specifically tuned towards helping models and designers in the fashion industry start their careers.</p>
<p>The list of cities across the United States that have functioning incubators is large and growing larger. New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Seattle are some of the bigger names, but even the smaller cities in terms of size can pull together to get an incubator. Cities like Dayton, Toronto and Cleveland all not only have incubators, but ones that are specifically geared towards fashion and design, two disciplines that are specialized (and of special interest to Pattern!)</p>
<p>Indianapolis is the 12th largest city in the United States and is largely underrepresented in the incubator and co-working space. Places like the SpeakEasy that focus on space for technology start-ups are paving the way for co-working space and showing that it can be done. The problem moving forward is if Indy is willing to open its doors to other types of industries to join in on the co-working craze.</p>
