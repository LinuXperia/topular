<strong>
<p>Would it not be more complete information on which to consider budgetary problems, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tax increase needs</span>, to know what percentage of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all available revenues</span> are being spent in the referenced&#0160;areas?</p>
</strong>
<p>For decades, governmental - or quasi-governmental - use of taxpayer dollars has been splintered off into a myriad of agencies, boards and even private entities. </p>
<p>The big winners are those favored&#0160;entities with their bucket under the spigot.&#0160; They get the money and the broad spectrum of activities encourages complete confusion as to who gets what, who’s responsible for those determinations, and even most important, why is so much public revenue being controlled by unelected and non-responsible bodies.</p>
<p>Without attempting to direct blame for the whole mess on a specific organization, we’ll cite one relatively minor example. &#0160;Georgia Street. &#0160;We blew $12 million (about half of which was available federal &quot;transportation&quot; funding)&#0160;on this boondoggle in an attempt to make attendees of the Super Bowl happy. &#0160;Then we turned the operation over to IDI, a private but partially publicly funded body, to try to make an omelet out of the already scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>The big losers are, obviously, the taxpayers who can have no reasonable expectation of understanding - or chance to remonstrate - about what the hell is happening to their money going off in all these directions.</p>
<p>We suspect that identifiable&#0160;property tax abuse was significantly responsible for&#0160;many of&#0160;the changes. &#0160;Property tax payers - read &quot;voters&quot; - could see what they were paying for city services and, at least to some degree, where it was going by reading their tax bill. &#0160;Current spending, attached to and &quot;explained&quot; on the semi-annual tax bill, would very possibly have resulted in some street demonstrations. </p>
<p>A very significant part of the problem results from the irresponsible use of TIF districts and the arbitrary use of all sorts of tax abatement and &quot;loan&quot; schemes which enable &quot;crony capitalism&quot; to a dangerous degree.</p>
<p>The fact is that we have left&#0160;very important basic functions to struggle along with dwindling property tax receipts.&#0160; And we’re amassing millions of extra tax dollars to fund these &quot;off budget&quot; items. </p>
<p>Is it possible that there is no one among city leaders - business or political - who realizes that we’ve put far too many operations, some of which are highly questionable as legitimate use of tax dollars anyway, &quot;off budget?&quot;</p>
<p>We’re always told certain funds are legislatively obligated to particular expenditures. &#0160;As far as state laws are concerned, that&#39;s malarky!&#0160; The speaker of the house, possibly the most influential man in the state while the legislature is in session, is local. &#0160;If he said he wanted a bill to put tax dollars directly under approval by an elected body in Indianapolis/Marion County, why would out-state members of the assembly care to oppose that?&#0160; </p>
<p>No. &#0160;The fiscal situation in Indianapolis is exactly what city leadership wants it to be.&#0160; The average citizen taxpayer has no way to get accurate information about what is happening.&#0160; The misinformation published and confusion caused by lack of any logical investigation is intentional.</p>
<p>And, as we are now hearing, it allows the public to be bilked by further tax increases which are said to be&#0160;necessary because &quot;We already spend more than 90 percent...&quot; on public safety items.</p>
<p>Mr. Lotter, can we get an accurate figure from you<strong>? &#0160;What is that percentage when calculated against all tax revenues made available out of&#0160;the pockets of taxpayers, including state and federal?</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Fred McCarthy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>Recent developments have seemed to make the legislative branch of that government superfluous.&#0160; Through the use of unilateral presidential orders, legislation -&#0160;debated at length, adopted by the Congress and signed by the president -&#0160;becomes non-operative at the whim of that same president.&#0160; We refer at this point to the recent presidential decision to remove the members and staff of the Congress from participation in his proudest legislative initiative, Obamacare.</p>
<p>By a stroke of the pen, and with no visible opposition from either side of the aisle in the Senate or House of Representatives, the members and staff thereof have joined the millions of persons receiving government subsidy - although certainly none have less need.&#0160; Senators, representatives and all congressional staff will be on medical welfare.&#0160; Coincidentally, the labor union representing the employees of the Internal Revenue Service is demanding the same exemption.</p>
<p>Neither Republican nor Democrat is willing to be responsible for his or her own health insurance, apparently oblivious to the fact that this method of approving the greed involved is shredding the Constitutional provision for separation of powers.</p>
<p>The people who passed the law, and the people tasked with enforcing it on others, don&#39;t like it.&#0160; One would think that these people understand the provisions of the law better than anyone else. &#0160;They must. They want out! &#0160;But they are happy with everyone else being in.&#0160; Having finally found out &quot;what is in it,&quot; the president’s people now don’t want any part of it! </p>
<p>As a purely political consideration, one wonders whether Democrat members of the Congress have considered the precedent being set for the next time Republicans are in control. </p>
<p>Might the hundreds of waivers issued by the current administration be reversed?&#0160; Will there be other favored - or dis-favored - groups? &#0160;What might be the fate of some of the ultra-favorable actions on behalf of green or labor constituencies by the current administration?</p>
<p>Is the entire membership of the Congress so spineless - or greedy - or stupid - or all three - as to not be truly frightened by such &quot;executive legislation?&quot;&#0160; Is there no one in Washington who is willing to stand up and challenge such egregious action? </p>
<p>Some will undoubtedly cite the fact that presidential &quot;executive orders&quot; are nothing new.&#0160; True. &#0160;And some of them may have been bad.&#0160; Is that a reason to repeat the error?&#0160; Has any other president taken specific provisions of a law (in this case a law which is his own prime legislative accomplishment) and said quite openly &quot;We’re not going to do that?&quot;</p>
<p>If nothing else, these activities demonstrate either the complete lack of understanding, or complete disregard, of what the founding fathers had in mind. &#0160;The most widely&#0160;agreed thought at the Constitutional Convention was most likely the elimination of any future possibility of government by royal edict.</p>
<p>After two and a third centuries, are we moving back to that kind of tyranny? </p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Addendum:&#0160; We apologize for being so far off topic.&#0160; But locally&#0160;it’s just&#0160; the &quot;same old, same old&quot; repetition&#0160;with an IBJ editorial supporting the need for increased taxes for public safety operations. </p>

<p>We’ve been scanning through a good sized pile of news clippings from which we found inspiration for posts on this website over the years. (Space demands we do a considerable thinning job.)&#0160; A couple of items which caught our eye caused us to wonder about the city’s current approach to handling long term debt. </p>
<p>Back in early 2005, we learned that most of the debt for the RCA Dome - which was being demolished to make room for the new football palace - was still on the books. &#0160;About twenty five years of Food and Beverage Tax revenues had&#0160;seemingly evaporated, without much question as to where they had gone.</p>
<p>Paired with that situation was a clip from the IBJ dated Nov. 8, 2010. &#0160;The headline read, &quot;Conrad hotel investment paying off for taxpayers.&quot;&#0160; This was the deal where the city contributed $25 million toward the cost of a structure containing a luxury hotel and several condos in the million dollar price range.</p>
<p>The story gives us the breathtaking news that, &quot;The privately held company that developed and owns the 23-story project has made three payments totaling $85,680 this year to the Metropolitan Development Commission.&quot; &#0160;This was four years after the hotel &quot;made its debut.&quot;</p>
<p>That’s pretty good news.&#0160; At least better than no payments at all. Unfortunately, we saw no other reference to payments being made, so we have no idea as to the current situation.&#0160; But we did find it interesting that some simple arithmetic tells us this range of payment will have the city break even&#0160;in just 291 years!&#0160; </p>
<p>Dare we ask what&#39;s happening with the current debt for the new stadium?&#0160; Given our precedent of a 25 year life for a stadium, we will have torn down and built new structures eleven times in 291 years.&#0160; Taking into account inflation, what will today’s $750 million stadium cost in the year 2232?&#0160; Will RCA Dome dollars still be in the mix?</p>
<p>Not to worry. &#0160;By then the entire state will probably be a TIF district for sports promotion.&#0160; What the hell.&#0160; Maybe cricket will have replaced the NFL.&#0160;&#0160;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Fred McCarthy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>This plea seems appropriate because we do not understand the content of various stories in the print media over the years - specifically one which appears in the current IBJ under the headline, &quot;Pols mull tax hike to add officers.&quot; &#0160;Reference is to the serious lack of adequate financing for public safety functions of the city</p>
<p>In an interesting, well-written article here, the city’s budgetary problems are discussed. Most of the attention is given to the issue of income tax revenues, with fairly brief reference to property tax deficiencies. </p>
<p>The head librarian is quoted as saying, &quot;I’m sorry, but people want services.&quot; This seems to be a nod toward the idea that people generally are terribly chintzy and are not willing to pay for those ordinary municipal services to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>Ms. Nytes, the CEO of the library operation, has been a part of municipal governmental operations for years. She knows better than that.</p>
<p>What troubles most of the thinking people of the city is the abuse, misuse or even misfeasance involved in <strong>the distribution of the currently available revenues. </strong></p>
<p>This IBJ article makes no mention of that part of the problem. We see nothing about professional sports subsidies,&#0160;giveaways of parking buildings and other corporate goodies. There is no reference to the dangerous effect that ever-spreading TIF usage has on property tax revenues.&#0160; Questionable expenditures of tax dollars are never cited.</p>
<p>The reporter capable of writing the story certainly must have come across some of these items which are obviously germane to the basic report. &#0160;Why are they missing?</p>
<p>Since this is a recurring situation in the print media, we are left to assume that management’s editorial policy &quot;censors&quot; what competent reporters find in order to make sure that nobody &quot;rocks the downtown political boat.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the kind of approach that leads to a &quot;Detroit situation&quot; where you have simultaneous announcements of&#0160;municipal bankruptcy and plans for&#0160;a $400 million tax-supported hockey palace as &quot;economic development.&quot;</p>

<p>Starting on the front page and continuing on pages three and four, it includes a map - of about a quarter page - of the proposal. &#0160;The map pretty well gives us the proposed layout of the <strong>Red Line</strong> - Greenwood to Carmel; the <strong>Blue Line </strong>- East Washington Street to the airport; and the <strong>Green line </strong>- Noblesville to downtown Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Red and Blue are identified as &quot;bus rapid transit&quot; routes, while Green is listed as &quot;either train or buses.&quot; &#0160;Disappointment there.&#0160; We were under the impression that rail usage had been eliminated as a feasible possibility.</p>
<p>We had apparently upset some folks earlier when we referred to a &quot;Stadium-to-Palladium&quot; route.&#0160; It is nice to have our nomenclature verified, in that the northern section of the Red Line runs from downtown Indy to Carmel, ending at City Center.</p>
<p>We have argued in favor of a public transit system which will allow citizens of Indianapolis to be able to get around - and across - town.&#0160; We have insisted that spending history here indicates that particular idea will have a very low priority.</p>
<p>Our fears seem to be justified by two things. &#0160;The very extensive story on Thursday contains this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one sentence</span> about the proposal from &quot;Indy Connect,&quot; the organization pushing the concept.&#0160; &quot;Its plan also would double the size of IndyGo.&quot;</p>
<p>This then, is followed by a half-page presentation on the back of the Metro section of this morning’s paper (Sunday). &#0160;The first sentence of the text says, &quot;We need your input as we <strong>continue studying the Red, Blue and Green Rapid Transit lines</strong>.&quot;&#0160; (Our emphasis.) </p>
<p>It repeats the original map, with a few unidentified additions, and lists nine locations where public meetings will be held. &#0160;Each of these meetings is identified by color, indicating which of the three proposed lines will be the appropriate subject.&#0160; Are we too cynical in our reading of a line saying &quot;Guided discussions will be held every fifteen minutes&quot; which appears on the map itself?&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;We understand the need to stay on topic at such a public meeting. The question is, <strong>&quot;When will the specific topic be the improvement of IndyGo?&quot;</strong></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Fred McCarthy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"href";s:58:"http://indytaxdollars.typepad.com/indy_tax_dollars/rss.xml";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:12:{s:6:"server";s:6:"Apache";s:7:"x-phapp";s:13:"oak-tp-web049";s:11:"x-webserver";s:13:"oak-tp-web049";s:4:"vary";s:6:"cookie";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 17:48:16 GMT";s:10:"keep-alive";s:20:"timeout=300, max=100";s:12:"content-type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"21465";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 19:42:33 GMT";s:9:"x-varnish";s:10:"2424484998";s:3:"age";s:1:"0";s:3:"via";s:11:"1.1 varnish";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130725024141";}
