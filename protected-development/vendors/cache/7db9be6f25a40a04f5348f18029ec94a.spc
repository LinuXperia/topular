As a result, the CTA is now looking at a $10 million budget deficit for this year, the Tribune <a title="Chicago Tribune story" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-officials-cta-facing-10m-budget-hole-20130814,0,7348846.story" target="_blank">reports</a>:
<blockquote>Transit officials promised to eliminate the budget gap without imposing more fare hikes or cutting service. . .

The deficit is driven by incorrect revenue forecasts mostly involving the use of passes. Those system-generated revenue forecasts, which were produced in December, are off the mark by about $39 million for the full year, CTA budget records show.

The biggest miscalculation involved a nose dive in the use of the 7-day pass since pass prices were increased in January. Seven-day pass sales were below budget projections by $7.5 million in the first six months of 2013, the CTA reported.</blockquote>
The good news is the budget damage was mitigated by an improving economy, as the CTA saw an unanticipated increase in sales tax and real estate tax revenue. From the Jon Hilkevitch story:
<blockquote>Those public funding sources are up $13.2 million through June and are projected to be a total of $21 million higher than budgeted for the full year, officials said.</blockquote>
One thing to remember is that the $10 million budget gap is small compared to the $1.39 billion budget. It equals about 0.7 percent of that overall budget. That's why the CTA will be able to make administrative cuts without raising fares or cutting service.

It's still too early to tell what effect the pass increases will have on next year's budget. I'm a bit pessimistic about the CTA's ability to not cut service or raise fares next year. After all, they had to raise pass prices this year as a partial solution to a $165 million budget gap for 2013. Perhaps the economy will stay strong and more tax revenue will rule the day.

I think we can expect more opposition as groups learn the nitty-gritty of the BRT plan. Time will tell if the CTA changes the plan.

To commemorate this blessed event, the CTA will have two final special runs starting Thursday morning:
<ul>
	<li>A ceremonial short run will go round-trip and non-stop between Rosemont and Jefferson Park on the Blue Line. It will leave promptly at 10:05 a.m. from Rosemont. It won't stop at Jefferson Park; it will turn just north of that station for a non-stop trip back.</li>
	<li>A final full-stop regular run will leave O'Hare at 11:05 a.m. and make all stops to and from Forest Park. It's scheduled to make its final stop back at O'Hare at around 2:05 p.m.</li>
	<li>Normal fares will apply on both runs.</li>
</ul>
All eight rail cars will be decked out with their original exterior decals, according to a CTA <a title="CTA news release" href="http://www.transitchicago.com/news/default.aspx?Month=&amp;Year=&amp;Category=2&amp;ArticleId=3194" target="_blank">news release</a>, and will feature interior advertising cards from the period when they first launched.

The best news here is that with the retirement of these cars built in 1969-70, the entire CTA rail fleet will now be ADA-compliant and accommodate wheelchairs. The CTA will sell all except two of the remaining old cars for salvage. Two 2200s will be on display at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Ill., according to a Tribune <a title="Chicago Tribune story" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-oldest-cta-rail-cars-ride-into-retirement-thursday-20130807,0,2825209.story" target="_blank">report</a>.

Here's the current CTA transit map for the Blue Line:

This proposed map is chock-full of useful information on all CTA bus, Metra and Pace connections.

Bielaski helpfully provided potential reasons why the CTA might not want to change its maps, with their own responses:
<blockquote><b>Potential Objection:</b>  The Proposed Line Map is too crowded.

<b>Response:</b>  The current map underuses its space with abundant blank background and an unnecessarily large CTA logo.  Our Proposed Map is an efficient use of available space.

<b>Potential Objection:</b>  The Proposed Line Map is confusing because too much information is provided.

<b>Response:</b>  Similar to the Budapest Line Maps, the Proposed CTA Line Maps would trust that users of the system are able to process the information on the map and select what they need.  If you know you want to catch the 73 Armitage bus to Lincoln Park Zoo, then look for it, find that the connection is at Western, and exit the train at that stop.

<b>Potential Objection:</b>  There is no information on the map(or anywhere onboard the train) about where a bus connection will take the rider.  Without that information, the information about a connection is useless.

<b>Response:</b>  The connection information gives the rider information that the connection exists.  The rider can later find out if this connection is useful to him.  The rider may have family in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, see on the map that there is a California bus connection at Kedzie-Homan, and research if the California bus will take him close to his family for a future trip.</blockquote>
Of course, he forgot the most important reason - replacement cost. But this is a good idea that's definitely worth consideration by the CTA when it's time for a map refresh.

Certainly public transit will figure into that plan, along with biking, walking and yes, auto travel. Each day about 69,000 CTA riders travel on the bus routes on Inner and Outer Lake Shore Drive. The public hearings will be from 6 to 8 p.m. each night at these locations:
<ul>
	<li>Tuesday, <strong>Gill Park</strong>, 825 W. Sheridan Rd., third floor</li>
	<li>Wednesday, <strong>Truman College</strong>, 1145 W. Wilson Avenue, Atrium</li>

Meanwhile, a coalition of 15 civic organizations has what they call a "bold vision" for North Lake Shore Drive.

The groups last month released its <a href="https://www.activetrans.org/sites/default/files/North_LSD_Platform_Final.pdf" target="_blank">vision</a>, as well as a conceptual illustration that includes a bus rapid transit station. Here's a <a title="LSD conceptual illustration - high res" href="http://activetrans.org/sites/default/files/2013-05-31_Lake_Shore_Drive_Concept.jpg" target="_blank">high-res version</a> of the illustration, shown in low resolution below.

The first two planks of their civic platform mention public transportation:
<ul>
	<li>Facilitate safer, easier, more accessible and more comfortable East-West access between neighborhoods, Lincoln Park, Lake Michigan and the Lakefront Trail for people walking, running, biking or taking transit;</li>

Certainly public transit will figure into that plan, along with biking, walking and yes, auto travel. Each day about 69,000 CTA riders travel on the bus routes on Inner and Outer Lake Shore Drive. The public hearings will be from 6 to 8 p.m. each night at these locations:
<ul>
	<li>Tuesday, <strong>Gill Park</strong>, 825 W. Sheridan Rd., third floor</li>
	<li>Wednesday, <strong>Truman College</strong>, 1145 W. Wilson Avenue, Atrium</li>
	<li>Thursday, <strong>Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum</strong>, 2430 N. Cannon Dr., South Gallery</li>

Meanwhile, a coalition of 15 civic organizations has what they call a "bold vision" for North Lake Shore Drive.

The groups last month released its <a href="https://www.activetrans.org/sites/default/files/North_LSD_Platform_Final.pdf" target="_blank">vision</a>, as well as a conceptual illustration that includes a bus rapid transit station. Here's a <a title="LSD conceptual illustration - high res" href="http://activetrans.org/sites/default/files/2013-05-31_Lake_Shore_Drive_Concept.jpg" target="_blank">high-res version</a> of the illustration, shown in low resolution below.

The first two planks of their civic platform mention public transportation:
<ul>
	<li>Facilitate safer, easier, more accessible and more comfortable East-West access between neighborhoods, Lincoln Park, Lake Michigan and the Lakefront Trail for people walking, running, biking or taking transit;</li>
	<li>Significantly improve the safety, reliability, convenience, accessibility and comfort of all people traveling along the length of the lakefront, especially for public transportation and bicycling;</li>

A number of readers commented on my <a title="CTA Tattler story" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/cta-tattler/2013/07/cta-ventra-rollout-proceeds/" target="_blank">Sunday post</a> that they had not yet gotten an email from the CTA asking them to make sure their account information is up-to-date.

<a href="http://ventrachicago.com/" target="_blank">Ventra cards</a> can be activated by calling (877) NOW VENTRA. Chicago Card Plus customers’ balances or products will be automatically transferred to the Ventra system upon activation of Ventra cards.

Customers who received their Chicago Card and Chicago Card Plus through pretax transit benefit programs from their employers will begin receiving notification of their transition to Ventra starting in September.

The CTA says these customer groups will be the only ones able to purchase products or add value until September. All remaining CTA and Pace customers will be able to use the new system beginning Sept. 9, when Ventra cards will be sold at retail locations and at rail stations. Between Aug. 5 and Sept. 9, Ventra machines will be available only to reload Ventra value; riders will not be able to obtain new Ventra cards until Sept. 9.

The CTA also provided the following information about customer events and the Ventra transition calendar:

<strong>Upcoming customer events</strong>

In addition to dozens of community meetings, street festivals and other events this summer at which CTA and Pace have been providing an introduction to Ventra, the CTA and Pace will soon announce dates and locations to allow customers to obtain and register Ventra cards with a waived initial $5 one-time fee at community locations. The CTA and Pace encourage customers to “spend it down” – to begin spending down fare balances on current fare media in the transition to the new fare payment system.

The Ventra card has an initial $5 purchase cost, which is immediately refunded to the card for transit use upon registration online or by phone.

Customers who pay with magnetic stripe fare cards and unregistered Chicago Card customers will be able to transfer balances to their Ventra cards at select locations starting in September and throughout the transition to Ventra. However, spending down balances on current cards remains the simplest method of transitioning to Ventra.
