<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he house is cool. Quiet. Calm. Billie leaves the door open behind her, ready to run out again if her dad is awake. She can make out the shape of the furniture, but the details are blurry without her glasses. She knows enough from memory to step out of the way of the coffee table, around the squeaking floorboards, to put her hand out to tell her body just where the sofa reaches.</p>
<p>Upstairs her sister, Jean, is fast asleep with her stuffed animals. The nightlight in her room a faint and tiny star. She couldn’t have slept through all of the yelling. Not Jean who calls out into the hallway every time Billie comes in late at night from a party. Jean with her child’s smile. The one Billie is here to save.</p>
<p>She pauses at the bottom of the stairs, listening. The summer crickets are at their loudest. A car passes. The headlights sweep around the room, and when they hit her face she ducks away. Her hand grips the smooth knob of the stair railing. Her bare feet arched against the hardwood floor, ready to run.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>The planetarium is slightly dingy. Spider webs hang between the Styrofoam planets in a display case. An old woman sits behind a counter by the door. She takes a long time to count back the change from the twenty dollar bill that Jean’s father gave for admission.</p>
<p>There’s a group of schoolchildren sitting in the best seats. They’re a year older than Jean, and from a different school. They all wear matching shirts that say Chesterfield Academy. The private school. The kids have a map of the moon taped to clipboards. Their small hands hold pencils with spoons taped to the top so that they won’t be accidentally stolen. One boy smiles at Jean, and she turns her body so that her father cannot see her wave back.</p>
<p>She has a marble and a rubberband and a small plastic pony with purple hair in the pocket of her dress, but she doesn’t take them out to play with them. Billie warned her not to fidget. But Billie isn’t here with them. She’s gone out to a party, and their dad was pretty mad about it. The rubberband stretches, pops, stretches between her thumb and middle finger, hidden in the soft pocket of her hand-me-down dress.</p>
<p>Jean and her father sit together on one of the old benches. She counts the number of people there. Just under twenty. Across from her there are some men. When Jean goes back up to the counter to pick up a free star chart she passes them, the smoke of campfire lingering in their clothes.</p>
<p>“Did you skin it yourself?”</p>
<p>A man with a bright orange hunter’s cap spits a dark liquid into his soda bottle. “Yeah. Hung her up in the back yard.”</p>
<p>Jean sits down again beside her father and spreads the star chart across her lap. She can hear every word they say, as if they had cupped their hands up to her ear.</p>
<p>“What about the foal?”</p>
<p>The man’s bottom lip is puffed out with chewing tobacco. It makes his words muffled and heavy. “I’ll get her next season.”</p>
<p>It is a game she and her father play. They sit across the room from some people who are obvious newbies, and they don’t speak for the first few minutes. They listen to the people on the other side of the planetarium, to find out what secrets people reveal when they think no one is listening.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>Billie’s hand sweats. She wipes it on her pajama bottoms. Her dry throat aches, her mind fizzing a bit at the edges. But she doesn’t have time to get some water. He could wake up any moment. She takes one step onto the stairs. She waits. She listens. Glass shifts in the garbage can in the kitchen and makes a clink. She thinks she knows the type of glass by the heavy smell in the room. Dark green bottles with thick bottoms, the rim stained red with wine.</p>
<p>But they were at the planetarium until at least 9 p.m. That’s how late they ran when Billie was a kid. He must have started drinking right when they got home.</p>
<p>A high whine and water running through the pipes stops her. He must be awake. She runs back to the front door, bumping into the sofa along the way. It grunts as its wooden feet scoot across the hardwood floor. She crouches down on the front step and puts her head between her knees. Counting her breathing, measuring it, congratulating each slow exhale.</p>
<p>Her red Mustang sits by the front curb. There’s a streak of white on the front bumper. Her mother’s the one who put it there.</p>
<p>Billie considers running up to one of the doors, ringing the doorbell, and asking the person to call the police. All along the quiet street the front porch lights stay off. No windows lit by lamps or the blue glow of television. It’s<br />
3 a.m. on a Saturday. This is a gated community, a place where engineers and businessmen and even an astronaut have come to retire. People who have paid to not be part of these kinds of situations. Billie wonders if the police would just throw her out of the gates to the community.</p>
<p>Her breathing steadies.</p>
<p>“I’ll just be in there for a minute,” she thinks.</p>
<p>She stands up and steps back into the house. Her hand lingers on the front door, making sure it will stay open when she lets go.</p>
<p>Jean.</p>
<p>The keys. Her glasses. Her phone.</p>
<p>She walks into her father’s house silently, feeling for the first time like a thief, even though it is a name he has called her before.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>“You little thief.”</p>
<p>Jean holds the glossy star chart on her lap. She picked it up from the table by the front door. But she hadn’t stolen it. The lady behind the counter had nodded to her, told her it was alright to take it back to her seat. She looks up at her father, wondering if he is making a joke.</p>
<p>“Put it back.”</p>
<p>His voice is not unkind. But it is stern, and Jean does not argue. She travels the stars one last time, her fingers rubbing over the small, glow-in-the-dark paint that traces the constellations. She hopes that it will rub off on her fingers.</p>
<p>She folds the map together. Spoons and bears and sisters all bending into each other.</p>
<p>Maybe Billie has an old star map she doesn’t want now that she’s older.</p>
<p>The lady at the desk gives Jean a smile and presses a sticker onto her t-shirt before she can protest. It is a star. Jean sits beside her father, swinging her feet, hoping that when the lights go off her star will be visible.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>Billie makes it to the top of the stairs without too much noise. She peeks around the corner, and the door to her father’s bedroom is shut. Her hand rests on her throat, as if it could shield her windpipe. There has been no time yet for mirrors, but by the ache of her skin she will have to wear a scarf around her neck to her classes tomorrow. Not an hour ago his hands were on her neck, his rage filled the house.</p>
<p>Just like your mother. Sneaking in late at night.</p>
<p>The hallway floor is full of squeaking boards, all the way down to her bedroom at the far end. She steps and the floor groans, as if tired of all of this late night moving about.</p>
<p>Billie waits in the hallway, ready to run down the stairs and out of the house forever. She’s waiting for the sound of the door unlatching, for his stumbling forward with his fists against the wall. But his door stays shut.</p>
<p>And so does the one with the glow-in-the-dark star sticker on the doorknob.</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>The show starts. The lights dim slowly, a rapid dusk falling. On the dome the stars appear. Only a few at first, but then more and more step out of the dark. Stars that can’t be seen from the city. A woman gives a tour of the constellations with a laser pointer. Beginning at the North Star, she works her way around the sky, using the red beam to draw the swoop of a bear’s back and the belt hanging from Orion’s hips.</p>
<p>When the sky has been mapped out, the slideshow begins, and the woman guides her audience across the moon. The kids with the clipboards stare in awe, and then scribble on their maps as the woman names the seas. Jean pulls the head of her plastic pony out of her pocket to take a peek at the slideshow.</p>
<p>Jean thinks of the moon as an emotional journey. Maybe in the future there will be a tour you can take through all of the romantically named areas.</p>
<p>The Ocean of Storms, where you face your fears.</p>
<p>From there into the Sea of Vapors, where the past comes to settle its score.</p>
<p>And then into the Sea of Serenity, and finally the Lake of Sleep.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat I need to write is the voice but I never find an entire voice at once. Because I have to start somewhere, I&#8217;ll settle: for a sound, a single sentence, an utterance in the dark, anything that has a little bit of spark or sizzle, that lights me up. This is sentence as light-bringer: there was a blank and now there is a single mote floating in the void, all potential, waiting for the bang.</p>
<p>Huh, I think. What&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>Next the voice speaks again. Sometimes it speaks on its own but more often I have to prod it, have to drag from that sentence a next one that somehow continues whatever power the first one contained. I get this part wrong a lot. Maybe most of the time. If I can see how it&#8217;s wrong right away then I try again. It&#8217;s okay to be wrong a lot of the time while drafting, while I&#8217;m still alone in the little room where I do my work. Plus, I can always return and revise and rewrite. I can and I will. This is how we hide our failings.</p>
<p>Now the voice speaks again, speaks directly or at a slant or else it reverses itself completely, and wherever it goes I need to follow its path. Then there are three sentences and then there are four and then five, six, seven, on and on. And from this process everything else I need appears, not planned but discovered, emergent: character, motivation, conflict, tension, plot, a world.</p>
<p>I believe that it&#8217;s possible to do this from one end of a book to the other without break or fail, but that does not mean I believe it will happen for me. I&#8217;m afflicted with various kinds of personal weaknesses, lacks, and distractions that probably make this an impossible ideal. But I sometimes get a couple good sentences in a row and if I can&#8217;t figure out how to keep going then I start a new thread, build a new fragment, eventually creating a pile of these similar-voiced fragments, scenes and parts of scenes and runs of images or actions. When it feels like I have enough I start arranging the fragments, looking for patterns and possibilities—and then I write into the spaces between, trying to take advantages of juxtapositions, connections, surprises and seeming inevitabilities, places to start from again.</p>
<p>If this works out long enough I might get a story drafted. If it works out for a very long time, then I might be writing a novel. Whatever it turns out to be it&#8217;ll be something I never could have planned—discovered one sentence at a time, arranged toward completeness, ready to be revised and rewritten mercilessly—hopefully on its way to at last becoming a manifestation of that possible world I sensed, way back on the first day, when all I had to work with was the microcosm of the whole hidden within the very first words.</p>

<p>I could arrive from anywhere. Any scarf,<br />
any stocking. An old belt. Shoelaces.<br />
even when the knives and pills and<br />
nasty things are all taken cautiously out<br />
you have not gotten rid of me. I hide.<br />
I transform. I know the glory of the<br />
breath, ridged tunnel of its passage<br />
small throbbing lines of fluid along<br />
the sides of the neck. The muscles’ twitch<br />
and slacken, vision gone dark<br />
then fireworked through with stars.<br />
When men come to me, half the time<br />
they are in search of orgasm, or else<br />
they are thinking of wild west outlaws:<br />
gallows for everyone to see their tough<br />
wronged glory. But when the girls come,<br />
they come to die. To be held in the dark<br />
forever, heavily, no more breath or choices<br />
they freshen the water in the dog’s bowl,<br />
pick an hour of the day they have all to<br />
themselves, and they fashion me, loop<br />
and hitch of the long fabric. They know<br />
the way the body will shed its waste<br />
how the face will twist, contort, they<br />
know they will not be pretty. So<br />
I hold them in a slow<br />
twirl. My newfound brides. Daughters<br />
of air.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ammy was tired of theory and wanted to sleep with an Indian. A card-carrying, reservation-born Native American with a drinking problem and a ninth-grade education. Since Michael had decided that long distance wouldn’t work out, the thought had become the focus of nightly episodes in which she swayed in the center of Ponderosa’s pine-paneled bar to the ghost of Hank Williams and Patsy Cline. She imagined being interrupted by a warrior, like Uncas from <em>Last of the Mohicans</em> or Abel from <em>House Made of Dawn</em>. They’d drink too much, the way they drank in the movies. He’d take her home; she’d let him think it was his idea. She wanted to be conquered and needed a warrior, which is why she found herself in Strychnine.</p>
<p>The bar was less full of lonesome cowboys than she had hoped, and pulsed instead to dub-stepped beat; the floor was gummy and clung to the prick-points of her heels; nothing was at all like the bar of her imagination, where she had two-stepped barefoot. She’d read that Strychnine was an Indian bar, but her one-sixteenth-Cherokee, diluted by Chinese and Irish blood, seemed to carry the red man demographic. Granted, she was only six miles from home, but she’d expected Strychnine to feel like another dimension. She felt cheated by <em>The Toughest Indian in the World</em> and Seattle, a city covered with Salish salmon designs but no Indian as far as the eye could see. She sidled up to the bar.</p>
<p>“I’ll have a whiskey, neat.” Tammy had never had a whiskey, neat or otherwise, but she wanted the courage of the old west.</p>
<p>The bartender set the glass on a coaster in front of her. Tammy adjusted her short, brown dress and slid onto a stool at the edge of the bar and cradled the drink between her hands. She wanted to make a ceremony out of the first taste. Her tongue—the whiskey—molasses, smoke, and Christmas. Whiskey tasted like hard Southern living.</p>
<p>The man on the barstool next to her swayed standing up, his arm with its Rainier clutched haphazardly, jostling onto her legs without apology. The stories they told during freshman orientation about girls who drank alone never ended well. But that was the point, wasn’t it? She took a drink, and her stomach lit up, warm with the 90 proof. Didn’t she want to do something risky? She had written pages upon pages about Indians for her senior thesis; didn’t she deserve to touch one? To escape the pages of her books and make her writing real? The more she drank the easier it was to drink more. She stared through the whiskey at the coaster underneath: Kokopelli, magnified by glass. She tipped the rest into her mouth, closing her eyes, and when she finished she looked across the bar. An Indian looked back at her.</p>
<p>He waved two fingers, not to call her over, but in recognition, a salute that said <em>you exist and I have seen you</em>. His hair was just as black as hers, though longer and braided. He seemed authentic. She bit her lip and glanced at the wall, flushed, and suddenly very aware that she had only slept with one man in her life. She rolled the empty glass back and forth.</p>
<p>Tammy didn’t know anything about seduction, but she did know that she was tired of reading about beautiful red people doing beautiful purple things in beautiful green places, and she wanted something beautiful for herself, so she smiled at him. He patted the man next to him on the back and whispered in his ear, then held up two fingers to the bartender and pointed at Tammy. The bartender set down two glasses of whiskey in front of her, each uncomfortably full. They left a wet path behind when she pulled them closer.</p>
<p>The Indian stood next to her. “I’ll trade you.”</p>
<p>“Trade me?”</p>
<p>“A glass for a name.”</p>
<p>“Tammy.”</p>
<p>He held his hand out, offering her a drink. On closer inspection, he was handsome in a way her boyfriends had never been, without the fragility of Sean’s Anglo-Saxon cheekbones and the freckles that dotted his shoulders, without the smoothness of Jun’s skin, without Michael’s bristly, black stubble from the beard she begged him to shave. He was strange angles, of rough noses, and full lips, <em>the bold outline of his high, haughty features</em>. He took a drink and grimaced. “Fuck, you drink firewater.” She laughed. He looked young, recently off the rez. He had a green shirt on, frayed at the seams, the black outline of a tree on the front and Sequoia National Park written underneath. “Don’t you want to ask my name?”</p>
<p>Tammy looked him over. Odds were, his name would only disappoint her. She didn’t want him to have an average name. She wanted him to be The Man With The Turquoise Stone Heart. She wanted him to be The Man With Scars On His Back. She wanted him to be The Man Who Would Paint Rivers Over The Hollows Of Her Hips With His Braid. She wanted him to be The Man Most Likely To Take Her Home. “I don’t want to know yet.”</p>
<p>He drank from the glass, and Tammy watched the corners of his mouth twitch. “So what are you going to call me?”</p>
<p>She squinted. “Geronimo.”</p>
<p>“Geronimo.” He rolled the name over in his mouth, considering it. “I like it.” He smiled a dogtooth smile.</p>
<p>“So, Geronimo, how do you afford your firewater?”</p>
<p>He pushed back into the bar stool next to hers. “I’m a third year at UW. You?”</p>
<p>“Fourth year. What are you studying?”</p>
<p>“Statistics.”</p>
<p>Tammy shook her head. She wanted him to be passing through: a priest, a poet, a heart full of something more than numbers.</p>
<p>“Don’t like statistics?”</p>
<p>“Not much,” she said. Tammy believed in right arguments, not right answers. “I wasn’t really any good at math.”</p>
<p>“Statistics isn’t just math. I mean, there’s math, but there’s more, too. We get to interpret the math. Numbers are just numbers without a context.”</p>
<p>Tammy didn’t know how to flirt over math, or the context of math, so she gripped the glass in front of her, and when she lifted it, the alcohol dripped down the sides. She leaned forward to keep her dress dry. “Give me an example?” The whiskey burned.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the numbers to back me up, but I’d say that you sitting alone at a bar is statistically unlikely.”</p>
<p>She laughed. “Who said I’m here alone?” She thought he blushed, but it was hard to tell.</p>
<p>“I saw you come in. What are you studying?”</p>
<p>“Ethnic studies. I’m turning in my thesis on Native Americans tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Native Americans—cool. I grew up next to the Barona rez in San Diego.” Not on the rez, then, but near it. “Native Americans in general, or something more specific?”</p>
<p>“Depictions of sexuality, actually.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. “I don’t know if I’m allowed to say anything now.”</p>
<p>“Are you a Puritan, Geronimo?” Her eyelashes felt heavy.</p>
<p>“Far from it.” He pinched the collar of his t-shirt. “But you know, the things you don’t talk about with new people—sex, politics, religion.”</p>
<p>“I think those rules only apply if you plan on having long-lasting friendships with the new people.”</p>
<p>His eyebrows twitched. Tammy looked at him, the boy with the darkest skin in the crowd, so brown-red-russet it revved her courage and made her think of beautiful things she wanted to do to him. Wispy hair at the nape of his neck had come out of his braid, and he seemed momentarily breakable. She wanted to feel the braid on her neck as he pulled his face close to hers. She had spent years studying things she didn’t understand, couldn’t understand, couldn’t touch. She wanted context. She wanted to touch him. She wanted him to be The Man Who Made Things Make Sense For A Night.</p>
<p>She picked the glass up and finished it, ignored the burn, swallowed hard. She put it upside down on Kokopelli. “You’re here alone, too?”</p>
<p>He motioned across the bar. “Well, I’m here with friends, but not <em>with</em> anybody.”</p>
<p>“How do you feel about being plus one?”</p>
<p>He downed his whiskey. “I think I feel alright about that.”</p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p>Geronimo lived in a dorm with posters of Che and Crazy Horse on the wall behind his desk and books full of math on his shelves. The room was spartan, clean for a boy, or at least cleaner than the rooms of most boys she’d known. Michael’s had been a mess. No bedframe, an aura of books around his mattress; they had spent a year on the floor. No possibility of that, not in the room with a twin bed against the wall.</p>
<p>She leaned back against the short hallway where the door swung into the dark room and looked at him, her hands pressed hard behind the small of her back, pushing on her hipbones. Geronimo leaned against the bedframe like they’d known each other for more than an hour in a bar and a bus, like he’d already touched her the way she’d been wishing, <em>touch my shoulder, touch my cheek, kiss me, because I am lost and afraid</em>.</p>
<p>She bit the inside of her mouth and pulled one hand out from behind her, smoothing her hair behind one ear. It had gotten a little wet during the walk to campus. He was so dark. She wanted him to touch her first. It was windy outside and the building groaned, burying itself into its foundation. The mist had left a spider web on his hair. Why wouldn’t he touch her?</p>
<p>“Do you,” he cleared his throat, “want to watch a movie or something?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly.”</p>
<p>She blinked. Why did her parents ever warn her about men and sex? They never seemed to want sex, or at least they never seemed to want her, they never seemed like they understood anything at all. She always led the breadcrumb trail to her body. In her romantic history, she’d never fended off advances; never been thrown up against a wall in brutal passion; never been wanted so much they couldn’t make it home. Maybe modern men were lazy. She didn’t want modern men. She wanted the warrior. She put her hand back behind her, and he scanned the room for another distraction. She rolled her eyes and wondered if she’d picked the wrong Indian. Maybe this one was too young. Maybe he didn’t know what to do with a woman. He was a year younger than she. Just one year. Was it possible that he didn’t know what it meant when a woman asked to be brought home? When she pressed her hips out, did he not know that he was to pull them close to his, to take the breath out of her throat? She had never struggled to have her body language understood before, but maybe Michael had a translation guide Geronimo couldn’t touch.</p>
<p>“So what do you want to do?”</p>
<p>She looked up at him, but didn’t answer him; didn’t want to have to be in charge; wanted the warrior. Maybe this was a mistake. She licked her lips, and he made eye contact with her, and she hoped that her hazy eyes looked beautiful and sober and promising. The wind blew harder and the floor moved under her feet. Whiskey was stronger than she had expected. She felt brave but didn’t want to make the first move. He leaned back into the wooden bedpost, and she thought about statistics, and science, and the way the words the body used had nothing to do with the words their mouths did. Why wouldn’t he touch her?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> write by osmosis. I write by divine decree. I write by heart, the heart shaking itself off like a dog that has nearly drowned in light. Or the heart dimly lit, sputtering and darkening, the heart shattering and held together again with duct tape and kindergarten paste. I write by memory, which is a beautiful liar. I write lies. I write in an alternate universe, in bed, hating the world and the word “I.” I write at a desk and feel virtuous. I write without a thought in my head. I write groveling for love and attention, and indifferent to everyone and everything. I write crap, shit, clichés, whiny complaints, black speculations, goofy formulations, and give up. I go back and write <em>nada nada nada I suck why can’t I write anything</em>, and give up again. I write something I like and the next day I realize it’s shit. I write a poem, a story, a novel, an essay, a play. Each time I’m lost. Each time I wish I hadn’t started down this road, where I can’t see my hand in front of my face, a ravine on my right a swamp on my left; there’s no one else walking where I’m walking, sometimes I’m crawling, sometimes I stop and weep. Then there are stars, or a cloud shreds itself before the moon, and I get up and keep walking. Sometimes I run and there is no pleasure like running down this road in the near dark, the wind full of voices, the air alive and fluid. I write and it’s finally right, the intention rhyming with the result, the marvelous unforeseen surprise of a field flowering with kisses. I write and it’s good and I am queen of the kingdom and every flower is for me. I write and it’s not good enough; I go and read someone who is very, very good, and feel inspired, and go back and write again. Or feel so discouraged I give up for that day, for a week, for nearly a month, until I stop believing the kingdom exists. I am cursed, until one day, mysteriously, the curse lifts. I go back to writing over and over, the irresistible lover I have known for most of my life, the monster that controls me, the jabbering creature on my back, the mother who wounds me with grace. I persist. There is a road that doesn’t end until I end, and then there is another road, and another I, trying again to tell you something true.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> saw him standing on the Ward&#8217;s Island Bridge and had to resist the urge to just stop and watch. I thought he might jump. So I climbed the ladder to the crosswalk and started walking toward him. It felt impulsive and slow at the same time—maybe it was just the heat that day, like there was a suddenness, but it was on a seven second delay. I was sweating by the time I came near. I shouted something, some sort of nonsense; it could have been anything. </p>
<p>The air felt thinner above the river. The water below roared in ways you never hear from the ground. The sound of traffic carried with the water, as if the traffic and the river were both shouting up, as if when you listened and tried to untwine all the strands of sound you could hear <em>Jump</em> coming from below. Or maybe I said, <em>Jump</em>, even as I meant to say, <em>Don&#8217;t jump</em>. Maybe <em>Don&#8217;t</em> had gotten tangled up in the city sounds. I don&#8217;t know. I had wanted to discourage him, to say something about being alive still. At least in the beginning. But then he was laughing. The man was laughing. Jump? Jump? he said. He&#8217;d heard the river too. Or was he laughing at me? </p>
<p>—I thought you were going to jump, I said. I was close enough to grab him, if I had wanted.</p>
<p>—I&#8217;m just taking in the view. His voice sounded exactly like mine, it had the same timbre, the same inflection. The water below seemed fraught with itself, breathless: —It&#8217;s quite a view, I admitted.</p>
<p>Did he say anything? We were watching a helicopter above Williamsburg now. It wasn&#8217;t any bigger than a fly. It approached, dangling over the water—steady, bigger now, like a dragonfly, then rearing overhead like a dragon, then away and off like a dragonfly again, then, north. Over Queens it was just a fly again, and then it was just a fleck of ash. </p>
<p>Traffic had stopped. People were getting out of their cars and shouting, <em>Don&#8217;t Jump</em>, or something. The way the sound rose, you could just hear <em>Jump</em>—you could feel all the desire gathering up with the roar of the river, chaotic and musical. </p>
<p>—I drove a taxi all through grad school, he said. I always hated that parkway.</p>
<p>—Sometimes I drive around all day, I said: I&#8217;ll just take a rental out upstate, drive around like I&#8217;m still married, like we&#8217;re looking for a place to spend a few hours.</p>
<p>—Those were the days. </p>
<p>—A nice forest preserve, someplace like that, I said.</p>
<p>We jumped. Or, at least, we were no longer standing on the bridge. The fall seemed to never end. We were in a free fall. It felt perpetual, binding. The wind roared, like it had jumped along with us.</p>
<p>—We were married there, you know. My wife and I.</p>
<p>—There? he asked. </p>
<p>I pointed:</p>
<p>—Carl Schurz Park—over the underpass where all the traffic has stopped. It was a lovely wedding, I said. </p>
<p>—I don&#8217;t doubt it, he said. It&#8217;s where the mayor lives, after all.</p>
<p>—I wonder will the water be cold, I said. I suppose I was just trying to keep conversation up. Trying to keep our minds occupied. </p>
<p>—I never married, he said. I think I would have had an Episcopalian service. Big church. Doleful bells. He seemed lost in thought.</p>
<p>For how long we fell I don&#8217;t know. I put on weight and my hair thinned and grayed. We lost interest in each other&#8217;s conversation. We flew into little silent rages and moments of extraordinary gratefulness. It was hard to talk over the roar of the approaching water but, you know, you get used to shouting. You forget the water. You just keep falling and falling. I woke a thousand times. I dreamed about driving for miles and miles, looking for state forests, places to stop. Places with names: Loyalsock, Susquehannock, Hogsback. Would the river smash us like stone? Would our hearts explode instead, before we hit the surface?</p>
<p>He was singing <em>Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings&#8230;</em></p>
<p>—Never had kids, I shouted. I saw my wife somewhere waiting up. I saw her writing down names. Now the harder edges of the city had turned to dust, its yellow ghosts hung shapeless in the ozone. The skyline looked like a diorama some neighbor kid had smashed up. Like you come home from work and there&#8217;s this strange kid sitting in your living room, and there&#8217;s a skyline all over the floor.</p>
<p>I thought about an old joke I still found funny. Joke still made me laugh. Then I realized that I had misunderstood what had been funny about it. It had taken all these years. All along the thing had just flown over my head. And still, even now, I found myself laughing.</p>
<p>I had an unrelated thought. I closed my eyes and it was gone.</p>

<p><em>Chuck Klosterman is a pop-culture savant who talks sports for </em>Grantland<em> and dispenses advice in his Ethicist column for </em>The New York Times Magazine<em>. Along the ride, he’s also written for </em>Spin<em>, </em>Esquire<em>, </em>GQ<em>, </em>The Believer<em>, and </em>The Washington Post<em>. Klosterman is perhaps best known for his five books of non-fiction and essays—</em>Fargo Rock City<em>; </em>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs<em>; </em>Killing Yourself to Live<em>; </em>Chuck Klosterman IV<em>; and </em>Eating the Dinosaur<em>—and a pair of novels</em>, Downtown Owl<em> and </em>The Visible Man<em>.   </em></p>
<p><em>In January, Klosterman visited Butler University to read from his new collection of essays, </em>I Wear The Black Hat: Grappling with Villains (Real and Imagined)<em>, for the first time. Before he stepped foot in Indy, Klosterman chatted with </em>Booth <em>contributing editor Chris Speckman on the phone about the falsification of memory, the beauty of Jimi Hendrix’s mistakes, the similarities between </em>The Wire<em> and Russian literature, the idea of Dave Eggers, a legendary junior-college basketball game in North Dakota, and the dream of not hating something you’ve written a decade after its publication.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Chris Speckman</strong>: How old were you when you began to have aspirations of being a writer? What initially drew you to reading and writing when you were younger?</em></p>
<p><strong>Chuck Klosterman</strong>: When I was a kid in elementary and middle school, I was maybe more interested in writing and reading than other kids, although not to the point where I thought, <em>This is what I want to do for a living</em>. That’s not because I had some sort of apprehension or distaste or insecurity—I just didn’t think of writing as a way to make a living.</p>
<p>I was pretty old before it occurred to me that it was a viable career. When I went to college at the University of North Dakota, I assumed that I would probably become an English teacher and a football coach or a basketball coach. Not because I had this dream of doing that, but it just seemed like something I would be good at. Then I found out that our college newspaper paid people to work at it, and it blew my mind. I figured that was way better than getting a standard job. I started writing for the newspaper, and it was just a natural thing. I felt like I was okay at it right from the get-go. I started working as an editor, and I just loved it. It was so fun. I loved the people I worked with. I realized that if I majored in journalism, at least I knew what the job was at the end. At that time, I sort of thought that working at a newspaper would be my life. I still wasn’t really thinking of book writing necessarily. Eventually, I just tried to see if I could do it. I was working in Ohio, and I wanted to see if I could write a book-length manuscript.</p>
<p>So it was never like I had this dream, and the dream was fulfilled. It was like I fell into the dream that I did not know I was having.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>I’ve heard you talk about people who have to write—people who just have that compulsion. Would you say that you’re someone like that or more like someone who has simply found a career as a writer that’s preferable to any alternative?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: I do love writing. But I don’t feel a compulsion to write the way some writers suggest. There isn’t a great separation for me between thinking about something and writing about something. Writing about something is almost the process of working through my thoughts on it. I don’t write anything that isn’t published. To me, that’s the difference. There are some people who seem like they would write even if no one was going to see their work. They have the need to prove it to themselves that this worldview exists. I’m not like that. If I’m not going to write about something, I’ll just think about it. I don’t need to share it with other people. However, I think sharing it with people is a great way to live. The process of writing is always pleasant. Maybe not always pleasant, but always engaging. The process of publishing is often not. Sometimes I hate the process of publishing. But you have to publish in order to keep writing. That’s just the way it works.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>So you’ve never been a person who keeps a diary or writes secret poetry or jots down lots of notes about things that are going on in your life?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>But it does seem to me that you’ve managed to catalog a great deal of stuff that has happened to you, and it seems like these may be things that have come out later in your writing. Do you write down a lot of observations, or do you just have a really great memory?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: Probably the latter. I think the difference between non-fiction writers—particularly essayists and memoirists—and other people is that they can’t really get over the past the way that other people do. I think that’s part of my problem. The things that happened to me when I was fifteen or twenty or twenty-five, I still think about, and it feels like I think of them in a very vivid, clear way. That might be a product of my falsification of my memory. Perhaps I remember things, and I’m really just talking about the way I want to remember things, then I create this memory by writing it.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>In many ways, it seems like growing up in small-town North Dakota may have limited your exposure to pop culture growing up, at least when compared to the access that a kid who grew up in a place like New York City might have had. Do you think this contributed to your obsession with pop culture that has dominated much of your writing?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: I think in a weird way it was definitely an advantage. If you’re exposed to a thousand different bands, the process is really just wading through all that material, trying to deduce what has value and what does not. It’s almost just like sort of ranking it, and then you need other people to guide you. You need the critics to tell you that bands like the Velvet Underground are important. But when you only have, say, fifty bands, you’re as interested in those fifty as you would be the thousand. The amount of time and engagement you have with this small sample size is the same as if you had a huge sample size. You end up thinking about these things with probably a little more intensity.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, Guns N’ Roses was the most interesting art in my life. I didn’t have access to more interesting films. I could get books, but with those I needed to be a little bit older to be guided along. So I would think about Guns N’ Roses the way I probably would have thought about something conventional high art if I had grown up in Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>Do you think your background in journalism and looking through other people’s eyes sparked your interest in the kind of voyeurism that is the cornerstone of </em>The Visible Man<em>? Or do you think your natural interest in others led you to pursue journalism?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: That’s a very good question. I suppose maybe the former. I hate to say this is a problem, but I have one particular hurdle that is not specific to me only but specific to people like me—because I’ve done so much first-person essay writing, the assumption is that when I write anything, I’m writing about myself. So when I was deciding to start that novel, my initial idea was that I’d need a situation where the Invisible Man character talks about his life to someone directly. The obvious person would be a journalist. But I knew if I did that, everyone would assume the journalist was a stand-in for me. I just knew that would happen, so I thought to myself, <em>What’s another situation where someone’s able to lecture another person about their life?</em> A therapist is the other option. In a way it’s even more limitless because there’s the assumption that the therapist will tell no one.</p>
<p>So what’s really happening in that book is just one really long interview. So it is in a way journalistic. If somebody said “What is <em>The Visible Man</em> about?” the obvious answer is that it’s about the reality of being by yourself. But there’s also a lot about the idea of interviewing and the problems of interview, but also the fact that, despite its flaws, there’s no better way to understand other people than asking them direct questions.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>So you would say that the repetition of interviewing people led you to see that?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: Totally. But the biggest thing is that from 1991 until 2001, I was pretty much strictly a journalist, and I interviewed probably a thousand people in various ways, sometimes for big profiles, sometimes for ten minutes because I’m doing some bullshit story on a zoning law. So I’m doing interviews for ten years, and then these books come out, and all of the sudden, I was being interviewed more than I was actually interviewing. Definitely between 2005 and 2006, I was being interviewed way more often than I was interviewing people. That changed my perspective, too. I know I’m not the only person who this has happened to. But I do think that I have a relatively unique perspective on the process of interviewing because I’ve done so much of both sides of it.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>In </em>The Visible Man<em>, the character Y— asserts that the difference between fiction and nonfiction is that “only fictional stories require an explanation. Only fictional story can’t have accidents.” Is this a belief that you also buy into, and, if so, have you found the process of writing novels to be more challenging and taxing than writing essays and non-fiction?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: The answer to the second part is absolutely. It’s much harder. I would say on a difficulty scale of one to ten, journalism is maybe a two, writing an essay is a four, and writing fiction is probably a nine.</p>
<p>And this is why. So you’re doing this interview with me right now, and what would be the best thing that could happen from your perspective? It would be if I said something that made no fucking sense whatsoever, if I said something that was just crazy and a total non sequitur. Or if I was talking to you and said, “Oh, I’m looking out my window right now, and I’m seeing a murder happen.” That would be great for your story, because in non-fiction, what you’re looking for are things that make no sense. Those are the moments of tension in a non-fiction piece, when a subject says something unexpected or an event happens that’s just a huge coincidence. But in fiction, people hate that. People are always looking for the reality of a fake world that accurately reflects their world. So you’re constantly looking at these problems and saying, <em>What is the most reasonable thing that could happen here? What could happen here that would make somebody say, “I could totally see that happening.”</em></p>
<p>It’s an interesting limitation, and it gets even harder for people who write movies and television. Take a show like <em>Homeland</em> for example. If people have issues with <em>Homeland</em>, it’s always about the verisimilitude. Did something happen in this show that doesn’t seem real to them? The whole thing is based off making it seem boring enough that it could happen in real life.</p>
<p><strong>CS</strong>: <em>I’ve heard you mention in interviews that writers should first be comfortable with their own work and not worry so much about their audience. Yet, I found there are several very “meta” passages in </em>The Visible Man<em>, where concerns of the audience seem to be directly addressed, like how Victoria classifies Y—’s long-winded narratives as “astounding to the point of pretension” and how Y— points out his good fortune in finding the exact tools he needs to quickly drug Valerie. Was this meta-ness brought into the book by editors, or an impulse inside of you?</em></p>
<p><strong>CK</strong>: If people don’t like my writing, one of the things that they don’t like about it is that it’s too self-aware. I understand that criticism because I have felt that of other people’s work. But as a writer, to me, self-awareness is what I equate with thoughtfulness. It’s an understanding of your own reality. So I write a book the way I would read it as a critic, which is not perfect. It would be ideal if I could separate those things out and not think of any of it. But the fact of the matter is I’ve been doing it like this for twenty fucking years. That’s how I’m going to be. I can’t read anything without sort of perceiving it the way I would as if I was reviewing it.</p>
