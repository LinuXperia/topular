<p>A pair of Indiana University players put up big numbers, as sophomore Kevin &ldquo;Yogi&rdquo; Ferrell and senior Will Sheehey scored 15 points apiece in the lopsided win, in which nine Americans scored in double figures. <a title="Yogi Ferrell" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/10/24/iu-celebrated-freshman-class">Ferrell</a>, an Indianapolis native and Park Tudor alumnus, logged a double-double, tallying a U.S.-record 13 assists.

They are also the ninth and 10th players from IU to represent the school in the Games, giving the school the most of any American institution. The pair is the third Indiana duo to compete together for the United States in the same Games, also the most for any school, and the first since Stanford&rsquo;s Matt Haryasz and Chris Hernandez played together in the 2005 games.</p>

Nope. Too lowbrow.</p>
<p>The former Indiana University basketball star is not just a freshly anointed Orlando Magic draftee and the NBA's No. 2 pick overall this year. He's also a trend-setter. Oladipo wore Google Glass for three days, including NBA Draft day, to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/28/4470344/exclusive-victor-oladipo-nba-draft-through-the-lens-of-google-glass" target="_blank">document his experience visually</a> for The Verge. For us commoners, the viewing experience makes for an intriguing look into all the glad-handing and polish that goes into an event such as that big-money draft. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/28/4470344/exclusive-victor-oladipo-nba-draft-through-the-lens-of-google-glass" target="_blank"><strong>See it here in full.</strong></a></p>
<p>Oladipo's experience was not without its hiccups. An NBA handler approached him in the Draft's green room to inform that he had to take off the eye-gear before the main televised event. Elsewhere, Oladipo accosted fellow IU standout Cody Zeller on the bus en route to the draft, to which Zeller said, "What <em>is </em>that<em></em>?"</p>
<p>This can be seen either as a gimmick or as the inventive breakthrough that it truly is. It's worth noting that American tennis player Bethanie Mattek-Sands <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_iMA-y_4KwA" target="_blank">also wore Glass this week</a> as she mounted her Wimbledon campaign.</p>

<p class="title">AWK-WORDS</p>
<p>This was either the best or worst exchange among all the press conferences.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTER:</strong> Why didn't you draft [Kansas guard] Ben McLemore?</p>
<p><strong>ROB HENNIGAN, Magic general manager:</strong> Because we took Victor Oladipo. <em>(pause)</em> We liked Victor better.</p>

(Plumlee originally hailed from Warsaw, Indiana, two hours north of Indianapolis, before his father pulled him and brother Miles, now with the Indiana Pacers, out of Warsaw's system and inserted them in a North Carolina prep school.)</p>
<p>The verdict? The victor? Well, just that: Victor. Oladipo again wins the night with his purple shirt and gray-checked suit, replete with matching vest. And, of course, Google glass to accessorize. Because, when you're about to make scads and oodles of dollars, why not?</p>

Oladipo was selected by the Orlando Magic while Zeller will head east to Charlotte to play for the Bobcats.</p>
<p>Oladipo was the highest Hoosier draft pick since Isiah Thomas was selected second in 1981. He became only the sixth player in IU history to be selected with one of the first two picks in the draft.</p>
<p>With Oladipo and Zeller going second and fourth, they became the first Hoosier duo to be taken in the first five selections. Indiana became the sixth school in the past eight years to have two players selected in the top five of the same draft.</p>
<p>Zeller&rsquo;s selection also has special significance for his family, as he became the third of three brothers to play in the NBA, joining older brothers Luke and Tyler. The Zellers now become only the third family in history to have three siblings play in the NBA, joining the Jones brothers in the 1970&rsquo;s and &lsquo;80s and the Barry brothers who played in the league at the same time from 1998 to 2000.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/06/28/iu-stars-oladipo-zeller-go-early-in-nba-draft";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/06/28/iu-stars-oladipo-zeller-go-early-in-nba-draft";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 10:16:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Brandan Alford";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"What Will Zeller Do?

Amid the speculation about whether <strong>Cody Zeller</strong> will go pro or stay in school (the latest from Peegs.com, an IU-sports blog, has him announcing within 48 hours that he's leaving), your best source may be the Amish guy who installed my dad’s windows.</p>

<p>He was part of a crew that worked on my dad’s farmhouse in Bloomfield (southwest of Bloomington) last November. The man—who lives near Zeller’s hometown of Washington—told my dad that he had recently given one of Cody’s brothers a buggy ride, and the elder Zeller had assured him that Cody would don the candy-striped pants again next season.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m wearing crimson-tinted glasses, but this sounds just crazy enough to be true. After all, Hoosier fans can rattle off the reasons Cody should stay: get stronger, work on finishing at the basket, refine his jump shot, chase a title, earn his degree.</p>

<p>The part that concerns me is that things have changed since November. Back then, Cody was touted as the potential No. 1 overall pick. Following what some have deemed an underwhelming sophomore season, his NBA draft stock has slipped a bit.</p>

<p>But until we hear from the Big Handsome himself, I’ll believe the beard.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/04/09/what-will-zeller-do-an-amish-man-knows";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/04/09/what-will-zeller-do-an-amish-man-knows";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Tue, 09 Apr 2013 08:59:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Keith Roach";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"Consolation Prizes: IU Basketball, Players Receive Honors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4698:"<p><img alt="" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/EI/sharedobjects/handlers/ir.ashx?p=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&w=144&mw=400"></p><p>Okay, so the Hoosiers didn't finish their exciting 2012&ndash;13 season on the high note IU fans had hoped for.

<p><img class="image_align_top_right" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="Jordan Hulls" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/The-Tipoff/hulls.jpeg" alt="Jordan Hulls" width="200" height="333" />Despite having <a title="March Madness finalists" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/03/07/just-announced-hoosiers-out-in-front-in-all-time-march-madness-voting" target="_blank">finalists</a> in the other categories, IU was shut out elsewhere on the ultimate winners' list&mdash;although two Indiana-born legends, <strong>Larry Bird</strong> and <strong>Oscar Robertson</strong>, did land among the 15 All-Time March Madness Players.</p>
<p>Current IU players have raked in some individual honors as well. On Thursday, guard <strong><a title="Coverdale on Hulls" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/12/15/coverdale-likes-what-he-sees-in-hoosiers-hulls" target="_blank">Jo</a></strong><strong><a title="Coverdale on Hulls" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/12/15/coverdale-likes-what-he-sees-in-hoosiers-hulls" target="_blank">rdan H</a></strong><strong><a title="Coverdale on Hulls" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/12/15/coverdale-likes-what-he-sees-in-hoosiers-hulls" target="_blank">ul</a></strong><strong><a title="Coverdale on Hulls" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/12/15/coverdale-likes-what-he-sees-in-hoosiers-hulls" target="_blank">ls</a></strong> was <a title="Senior CLASS" href="http://www.seniorclassaward.com/athletes/jordan_hulls/" target="_blank">selected</a> as the NCAA's Senior CLASS Award winner, reflecting not only his on-court grit and leadership, but also his personal character and work in the classroom and community. (And in a perfect world, wouldn't recognition like that be cheered even more loudly than a purely basketball-based designation? Also, on a personal note, the author of this post would like to point out&mdash;proudly&mdash;that he, like Hulls, is a graduate of Bloomington High School South, where Hulls led the Panthers to a state title in 2009. So there's that.)</p>
<p>It was also announced on Thursday that <a title="Oladipo" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/01/12/oladipo-becomes-ius-most-buzzed-about-player" target="_blank"><strong>Victor Oladipo</strong></a> finished third in Associated Press Player of the Year voting. Additionally, he was named to the AP's All-America first team earlier in the week. Not bad, considering that, coming into the season, most analysts regarded him as little more than a good role player who dunks and gets down on defense.</p>
<p>Now IU fans can get back to worrying about whether or not Oladipo and preseason All-American forward <a title="Zeller" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/10/18/one-year-later-cody-zeller" target="_blank"><strong>Cody Zeller</strong></a> will announce for the NBA draft.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/04/05/consolation-prizes-iu-basketball-players-receive-honors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/04/05/consolation-prizes-iu-basketball-players-receive-honors";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 05 Apr 2013 14:20:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Evan West";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Rachel Nichols: Thumbs Up for Oladipo!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1459:"<p><img alt="" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/EI/sharedobjects/handlers/ir.ashx?p=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&w=144&mw=400"></p><p>There wasn't much to admire about IU's sloppy Sweet 16 loss to Syracuse on Thursday.

He has been offering the dissenting opinion on the IU hoopla all season. <br /></em></p>
<p>I hate to say it, but I told you so. When I <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2012/10/18/the-naysayer-five-reasons-iu-wont-win-the-national-championship" target="_blank">predicted</a> at the beginning of the season that IU would bow out in the Sweet Sixteen, Hoosier fans still had quixotic visions of a national championship. (Although I'll admit, even I was wrong about Kentucky.) For most teams in the tournament, a Sweet Sixteen finish would have been a solid accomplishment. But for the Hoosiers, who haven&rsquo;t had a collection of talent like this in decades, it&rsquo;s a huge disappointment. Now all that&rsquo;s left is doubt about this team&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
<p>The story for Indiana this game was the same one we&rsquo;ve heard in most of their losses this season&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t handle size and strength. And it was over early. After the first seven minutes, the teams were jockeying for the final score difference, not for the trip to the Elite 8.</p>
<p>When fans step back and look at the season, I think they'll see this was a good IU team&mdash;not a great one. They had athletes and speed, but lacked cohesiveness. In some ways, they didn&rsquo;t even seem to have the momentum of last year&rsquo;s team going into the tournament. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Hoosier Nation awakes today to rub the sting of defeat from its eyes and casts a glance to the future, they will find that the sun is still shining, but not as brightly as the day before. The expected departure of Victor Oladipo will really hurt. But excitement is already building around incoming 6-8, 220-pound power forward <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/103380/noah-vonleh" target="_blank">Noah Vonleh</a>, Coach Crean&rsquo;s five-star recruit from Massachusetts who is rated 8th in the nation by ESPN.</p>
<p>Cody Zeller, on the other hand, should take a moment to reflect. He is a predicted first rounder, but every time IU faced larger and stronger opponents this year, Zeller looked like a boy among men. Last night was just another example. Zeller was trying as hard as he could, but he was getting blocked and pushed around by the Syracuse bigs. This will only be worse in the NBA. He could really benefit from another year of weights and about 20 more pounds to increase his presence in the paint before making the jump. Now, just imagine the expectations for next year&rsquo;s squad if Zeller returned ...</p>
<p>Dream on. Go Boilers!</p>

The CBS Sports <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/ncaa-tournament/expert-picks" target="_blank">experts</a> are split right down the middle about who will win. Almost all of the ESPN <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament" target="_blank">gurus</a> have IU advancing. And a lot of people still want to talk about Keith Smart&rsquo;s 1987 <a href="https://www.indystar.com/viewart/20130325/SPORTS0601/303250106/Indiana-s-shot-vs-Syracuse-1987-still-smarts" target="_blank">Shot</a>. <em>[See our "Where Are They Now?" <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=133112" target="_blank">photo album</a> from that 1987 championship team.]</em></p>
<p>But at the risk of encouraging an unhealthy habit, we turned to Las Vegas for the betting line. The Hoosiers started the week as a 6-point favorite, and have been falling slowly as the money pours in, currently sitting at <a href="http://www.latestbettingodds.com/2013-sweet-sixteen-game-odds-syracuse-indiana/" target="_blank">5.5</a>. The odds makers have had mixed success in this tournament. In the previous round, they had Syracuse by 7.5 points over California, and the Orange won by 6. But Indiana failed to cover its sizable 12-point spread over Temple, also winning by just 6.</p>
<p>How do they come up with these odds? A lot of it relies on sensible examination of the teams&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses. And then there are absurd variables like &ldquo;How Indiana Plays on a Thursday This Season&rdquo; and &ldquo;Historically, Syracuse&rsquo;s Record After Playing California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those seeking a more qualitative analysis, here&rsquo;s one: Syracuse will have no answer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwNGT24mN3I" target="_blank">Cody Zeller</a>.

And perhaps Knight is the last person one would ever say "graced" a magazine cover, but it cannot be argued that the man, the leader, the legend has left his imprint on basketball by way of his legacies, his charges turned titans (think <strong>Mike Krzyzewski</strong> at Duke), and his champs turned icons (<strong><a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1255712">Isiah Thomas</a></strong> and more—with the likes of <strong><a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1255717">Cody Zeller</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1255718">Victor Oladipo</a></strong> to follow?).</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/03/21/photos-ius-many-sports-illustrated-covers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/03/21/photos-ius-many-sports-illustrated-covers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 13:11:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Jonathan Scott";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Obama Picks IU to Win It All";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2035:"<p><strong>Unless you live under a rock,</strong> you&rsquo;ve probably heard that President Barack Obama has penciled in Indiana at the top of his <a title="Obama 2013" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/03/20/president-obamas-bracket-2013-ncaa-mens-basketball-tournament" target="_blank">bracket</a> for the 2013 NCAA men&rsquo;s basketball tournament.</p>

<p>2011 &mdash; Obama&rsquo;s pick: Kansas. Actual finish: Elite Eight. Winner: Connecticut.</p>

<p><strong>2009 &mdash; Obama&rsquo;s pick: North Carolina. Actual finish: Championship game. Winner: North Carolina.</strong></p>
<p>2008 &mdash; Obama&rsquo;s pick: North Carolina. Actual finish: Final Four. Winner: Kansas.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re not counting, that&rsquo;s one winner for Mr. Obama in five years serving as (or running for) president.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope he has better luck this time.</p>

<p>So said the ESPN announcer Mike Tirico just before IU's Victor Oladipo dropped a monstrous 360-degree slam dunk on the Fighting Illini squad that simply watched (likely in amazement) from down-court. With nary a defender to rebuff him, Oladipo went to town (namely to Chicago, at the United Center) as the No. 3 Hoosiers cruised to a victory by the count of 80-64 against an Illinois team that <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/02/27/video-the-new-rules-of-court-storming">shockingly upset them</a> in the regular season.</p>

<p>Cody Zeller finished with 24 points, not that anyone will remember that performance. Christian Watford contributed 15 points, and Oladipo himself added 12 points and 11 rebounds. The Hoosiers will play Wisconsin in the Big Ten event's semifinal round (Saturday, 1:40 p.m. EST, on CBS) after the Badgers took out the Michigan Wolverines 68-59 this afternoon.</p>

<p>The dunk (video below) proves once again that Oladipo's Twitter handle, his username on that social channel, remains arguably the most tested and true of any out there: <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/VICICANFLY4IU">@VicICanFly4IU</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Here's the clip of that smashing dunk by Oladipo:</p>

Sure, Hoosier fans were hoping Victor Oladipo would edge out Michigan's Trey Burke for Player of the Year (Trey got the nod). But Tom Crean seemed a lock to repeat as the best coach, with IU finishing the regular season as outright champions of the conference just a few years removed from the disasterous situation he inherited. Ryan only managed to lead his Badgers to fourth place.</p>
<p>Now, the Wisconsin coach's supporters will point to the fact that he made the most with what he had&mdash;his starting point guard Josh Gasser tore his ACL at the beginning of the season and missed all of it. But one has to wonder if Crean's unsportsmanlike <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nTDnJ6zjmcw" target="_blank">outburst</a> at the conclusion of Sunday's Michigan game had something to do with the decision.</p>

One can only assume that aggressive voting by Hoosier Nation has something to do with Alford&rsquo;s ranking thus far.</p>
<p>Isiah Thomas, of the Hoosiers&rsquo; &rsquo;81 championship team, lands on the list as well.</p>

<p>Just two short weeks ago, Indiana was even with the likes of Duke, Miami, and Kansas on the list of teams most likely to win this year&rsquo;s NCAA title. No one debated it. The only question was which one of those teams would win it all. But after the embarrassing bust that was Senior Night last evening in Bloomington, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see some of the experts start to abandon them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your game summary: Another tough defending team leads to another weak performance by Indiana. With everything to win (an outright Big Ten regular season championship and seeding advantages in the NCAA tournament), the Hoosiers played like a middle-of-the&ndash;Big Ten team against Ohio State. They shot just 39 percent. Zeller and Oladipo got into foul trouble once again. The game wasn&rsquo;t supposed to go this way for seniors Jordan Hulls, Christian Watford, and Derek Elston, but I can&rsquo;t say that I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the meltdown. Losing on Senior Night&mdash;just like old times for those three.</p>
<p>This is the time of year championship teams need to hit their stride and play their best ball. Look at Duke. Residing in the top five all season, the Blue Devils recently got the services of senior Ryan Kelly back after an injury and have become, in my estimation, the team to beat for the title. In the two games Kelly has been back, he has lit it up for 36 and 18 points respectively and Duke has been dominant. Miami is another team that would give the Hoosiers fits with their athleticism and quickness. And Kansas&rsquo;s height and shooting ability have always made them a title contender. (Sorry Gonzaga, despite your No. 1 ranking, I just can&rsquo;t see you&mdash;or the Hoosiers&mdash;playing consistently with the big boys.)</p>
<p>Indiana has been exposed as a team that plays well when everything is going their way, but can&rsquo;t fight their way out of a paper bag when faced with adversity. Tom Crean&mdash;a wonderful coach when ahead&mdash;can&rsquo;t seem to put all the right pieces together when faced with coming back from even the slightest deficit. He can clap and cheer all he wants, but until Zeller calls for the ball more aggressively in the post and Ferrell delivers more than just an occasional great assist, Indiana will be in for a letdown of epic proportions. Like I said at the beginning of the year, Sweet 16 and done for this team.</p>
<p>Even if they eke out a No. 1 seed in the Big Dance, the Hoosiers are now going to have a tough time getting that seed in the Big Ten tourney. This Sunday is a must-win at Michigan. If Indiana doesn&rsquo;t get a victory there (and I think it&rsquo;s unlikely), they will finish their best season in recent years losing three of their last four games. Going, as they say, the exact wrong direction.</p>

<p>The newspaper's story doesn't disappoint, unless you're hoping Knight is softening on his self-imposed exile from Assembly Hall and Tom Crean's efforts to woo him back.  "What do I need a hero’s welcome for?" Knight says in the article. "Obviously I don’t have any interest in going back, or I would have, it’s that simple."</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> the type to wish for such a thing—after all, Knight is wearing a crimson sweater in the magazine's photo—perhaps you need to read the book. Knight sums up its message thusly: "The worst word in the English language is 'hope.'"</p>

<p>The writer pressed the Hall of Fame coach about the media's coverage of his most infamous outbursts. "It’s just something that I ignored," he said, following up with, "That’s my answer. Let’s go onto something else. I’m tired of this."</p>

<p>The conversation isn't all curmudgeonly. Knight revealed how he monitored players' grades and how he dealt with those who slacked off: by making them run stairs at 5 a.m. " I did this with a lot of kids," he said, "but never twice."</p>

<h3>New York City</h3>

<p><strong>Traffic Bar</strong>
<em>986 2nd Ave.; 212-813-1595; www.trafficbarnyc.com</em> </p>

<p>Owner and IU grad Joey Morgan hosts Hoosier fans in perfect Bloomington style, offering Sink the Biz in the official Nick’s English Hut buckets. In addition, Morgan serves up Hairy Bears and Long Islands so similar to those at Bear’s and Kilroy’s that any IU fan will feel at home. </p>

<h3>Denver</h3>

<p><strong>Blake Street Tavern</strong>
<em>2301 Blake St.; 303-675-0505; www.blakestreettavern.com</em></p>

<p>The Denver chapter of the IU Alumni Association gathers the largest group of IU supporters at this spot for each game, cheering on the Hoosiers in the Mile High City's Ballpark neighborhood. Blake Street's award-winning menu goes beyond burgers too. Try the ahi tuna slider while you watch the game from one (or a few) of the bar's abundant flatscreens.  </p>

<h3>Los Angeles</h3>

<p><strong>The Parlor</strong>
<em>7250 Melrose Ave.; 323-930-2100; www.theparlorca.com</em></p>

<p>The Parlor in Los Angeles offers pitcher specials to fans who flock to this popular bar off Melrose. However, be sure to arrive early: The keepers of this place had to turn away IU fans during the Michigan game due to a full house of Hoosiers. </p>

<h3>St. Louis</h3>

<p><strong>Black Finn</strong>
<em>The Galleria Mall, 1147 Saint Louis Galleria; 314-726-5300; stlouis.blackfinnamericangrille.com</em></p>

<p>Some folks may not expect to find the biggest group of St. Louis-based IU fans in the local mall. But in truth, alumni descend in droves on the Galleria Mall to hoot for the Hoosiers. The game-day menu including soft pretzels and famous Finn fries complements the large selection of drink specials. </p>

<h3>Philadelphia</h3>

<p><strong>Tavern on the Broad</strong>
<em>200 S. Broad St.; 215-546-2290; www.tavernonbroad.com</em></p>

<p>Boasting a crowd of more than 50 fans during big-ticket games and at tournament time, Tavern on the Broad serves as Philly's place to be on Hoosier game nights. The owner’s father, an IU alum, turned his daughter onto the Hoosier Hysteria. Now the bar offers half-priced appetizers and domestic beers during games.</p>

<h3>Minneapolis</h3>

<p><strong>Crooked Pint</strong>
<em>501 Washington Ave. South; 612-877-6900; www.crookedpint.com</em></p>

<p>IU fans gather at the Crooked Pint on historic Washington Avenue to cheer on the Hoosiers and enjoy the house's “crooked” cocktails—all made with a combination of its craft beers and liquor complements. Although the majority of Minneapolis's IU fans gather here on game day, the bar is also known to attract Notre Dame alumni—so beware of the Irish!</p>

<h3>Atlanta</h3>

<p><strong>Hudson Grille</strong>
<em>4046 Peachtree Road, NE; 404-233-0313; www.hudsongrille.com</em></p>

<p>Atlanta's Hoosiers don’t miss a game. The local alumni group gathers at the Hudson Grille for every tipoff. Hudson Grille boasts five locations in the city; it's the Midtown spot that serves as the prime destination for IU fans. </p>

<p><strong>Bokamper's Sports Bar</strong>
<em>8990 Fontana del Sol Way; 239-431-7611; www.bokampersnaples.com</em></p>

<p>Legendary Dolphins player and sports broadcaster Kim “Bo” Bokamper may have a soft spot for Florida athletics, but that doesn’t keep IU fans out of his southwest Florida bar. With more than 70 plasma TVs, the area alumni association calls Bokamper’s home. So although the bar itself may don Dolphin’s colors, on IU game night, there’s no dearth of cream and crimson. </p>

<h3>Cincinnati</h3>

<p><strong>Cock and Bull Public House</strong> 
<em>Hyde Park Square, 2645 Erie Ave.; 513-533-4253; www.candbpublichouse.com</em></p>

<h3>Nashville</h3>

<p><strong>Jed’s Sports Bar and Grille</strong> 
<em>114 28th Ave. N.; 615-320-4399; www.jedsnashville.com</em></p>

<p>One of the newest sports bars in Nashville, Jed’s caters to the game crowds with its 1/4-pound hot dogs and two-for-one beer on Tuesdays. With deals like these, it’s no wonder that the Nashville alumni association has adopted Jed’s as its game-day hangout. </p>

<h3>Portland (Ore.)</h3>

<p><strong>Fire on the Mountain</strong>
<em>1708 E. Burnside St.; 503-230-9464; www.portlandwings.com</em></p>

Portland fans have found this and more at their local hangout—Fire on the Mountain, which claims the title of Stumptown's "Original Buffalo Wing Joint." Hoosiers swing in to try one of 12 wing sauces with fellow fans in the city's alumni group. And to go with those wings? FOTM also brews its own beers—including Hoosier Amber.</p>

<p>So, what spot(s) do you think we missed? Where do you go to have a spirited time on IU game days and nights?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/03/01/best-bars-nationwide-on-iu-game-days";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/03/01/best-bars-nationwide-on-iu-game-days";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 01 Mar 2013 06:47:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Rachel Graham";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"VIDEO: The New Rules of Court-Storming";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7723:"<p><img alt="" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/EI/sharedobjects/handlers/ir.ashx?p=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&w=144&mw=400"></p><p>Another week, another court-storming. In what has become the only predictable result in NCAA men’s basketball, last night students cheering on their home team (Minnesota) wildly flooded the court after upsetting a higher-ranked team (Indiana). The (over)reaction has become so ubiquitous, you’d think the NCAA had started awarding banners for it.</p>

<p>This season has produced many court-stormings more dubious than Minnesota’s last night. The Golden Gophers hadn’t beaten a No. 1-ranked team in 24 years, and they finally played to their potential. But court-storming can lay bare a fanbase’s low expectations. Minnesota fans, your team is a lot better than its middling Big Ten record suggests. Act like it. [<a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/02/27/the-naysayer-minnesota-beats-up-on-ius-soft-front-court">Related: What does our resident Naysayer think about it?</a>]</p>

<p>Court-storming used to be a spontaneous combustion of pure, unbridled surprise and joy following one of three things: beating Duke, a true Cinderella-story upset, or an epic last-second, improbable, game-winning shot. Now, it’s a matter of ritual not worth the YouTube kilobytes (unless a victorious player lifts a wheelchair-bound student to safety, as a North Carolina State team member did last month in a touching moment that <a href="http://youtu.be/W2Fil57YSkE">went viral</a>). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2F1ZyNGoQY">ESPN noted the trend</a> at the end of January, a month that saw eight storms within two weeks (including Butler, after upsetting Gonzaga). Since then, at least six more courts have been stormed, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/75751/where-we-draw-the-court-storm-line">ESPN weighed in again</a>, and <a href="http://deadspin.com/5983084/should-you-storm-the-court-an-all purpose-guide">Deadspin defended</a> face-painted sophomores’ right to go nuts. </p>

<p>This isn’t a new debate—ESPN even provided a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2306416">detailed court-storming rulebook</a> in 2006, citing such bylaws as the Ancient History Exception (“If your national titles predate Texas Western's, you are free to storm the court for any dramatic win over a top-five team”). But here’s how we know it has gone too far: Someone even mulled <a href="http://www.illinihq.com/sports/illini-sports/mens-basketball/2013-02-11/tate-let-storm-roll.html">a hypothetical court-storming</a> against <em>Purdue</em>. Before we get into March Madness, here’s hoping we restore dignity to feverish celebrations. To that end, let’s review some scenarios:</p>

<p><em><strong>Proviso:</strong></em><strong></strong> Students will take up a collection to pay the $5,000 fine. <strong>What to do:</strong> TO HELL WITH IT!

He'll be offering the dissenting opinion on the IU hoopla all season.</em></p>
<p>Well, Hoosier fans, how does it feel to get slapped around a little bit? Last night&rsquo;s game was not for the fainthearted. Just ask Cody Zeller, who spent a good portion of the game picking himself up off the floor. And before you say &ldquo;What about the Boilers? They stink!&rdquo;, consider this: IU is the one with Final Four hopes this year, and they continue to prove how vulnerable they are.</p>
<p>We live in a &ldquo;what have you done for me lately&rdquo; society, so many Hoosiers fans had forgotten about Minnesota and its early season prowess (15-1). Early in the Big Ten schedule, the Gophers seemed to be joining the cellar dwellers of the conference. But this game was a stark reminder that they remain very much in the hunt for a tournament bid. And I have to say, it was fun to watch.</p>
<p>The inside players of Minnesota took IU&rsquo;s bigs to the woodshed. Trevor Mbakwe (21 points, 12 rebounds) set the tone of the game early when he <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=8993050" target="_blank">stuffed Zeller</a> in a way the big man hasn&rsquo;t felt all year. Zeller looked frail and timid from that point on. Even when Mbakwe went out with foul trouble with 10 minutes left in the first half, IU could only muster a 4-point halftime lead.</p>
<p>The real player of the game, however, was backup center Elliott Eliason, who came in and scored seven points, grabbed five boards, and dished out an assist. That continued Minnesota&rsquo;s dominance on the inside while the Mbakwe was on the bench.</p>
<p>Jordan Hulls had a fine first half, prompting television announcer Dan Dakich to squeal with joy about him. But other than Hulls&rsquo; first half contribution (14 points), that&rsquo;s about all we heard from him until a desperation shot with just seconds remaining.</p>
<p>Several other players who played key roles in IU&rsquo;s recent win streak were conspicuously absent from the TV chatter as well. Will Sheehey&rsquo;s steal and subsequent <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=8994016%20" target="_blank">one hand slam</a> with a little over 9 minutes left in the first was one of the very few highlights for him. Coach Tom Crean called Christian Watford a &ldquo;non-factor&rdquo; in the game. And Kevin &lsquo;Yogi&rsquo; Ferrell hit just 2 of 10 from the field.</p>
<p>The win was a much bigger deal for Minnesota than the loss is for IU. The Hoosiers will have to claw their way to a Big Ten title now, but they still have the inside track. For the Gophers, the last win over a No. 1 was back in 1989. I was alive, but many current fans can only relate from the stories their elders tell them. Now, a new generation of Minnesotans has a story about <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=8993428" target="_blank">storming the court</a>. (Incidentally, that was not just permissible last night, as some have debated, but it would be a grand statement of apathy if they hadn&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>The Hoosiers need to take care of business the rest of the way, which will be no easy task. With three games remaining, the scariest one is the last at Michigan. But that contest looms large only if Ohio State and Iowa are beaten prior. Everyone knows Zeller is the key to the Hoosiers&rsquo; success, but if you&rsquo;re an IU fan, you can&rsquo;t like what you see from a guy who seems to lack the killer instinct.</p>
<p>March Madness is coming, and Minnesota just showed the country how easy it is to beat the Hoosiers if you play the slightest bit physical.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/02/27/the-naysayer-minnesota-beats-up-on-ius-soft-front-court";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/02/27/the-naysayer-minnesota-beats-up-on-ius-soft-front-court";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:54:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Mike Botkin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"Eric Gordon to Visit Assembly Hall for Today’s IU-Purdue Game";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2432:"<p>You might see a familiar face in Assembly Hall during today&rsquo;s rivalry matchup with Purdue (2 p.m., ESPN): former North Central High School phenom and IU star<strong> Eric Gordon</strong>.</p>

Of course, that was before an epic collapse by the country's top teams. Last week, No. 2 Florida, No. 3 Michigan, No. 5 Kansas, and No. 7 Arizona all lost. And the Hoosiers rebounded impressively to win at No. 10 Ohio State on Sunday.</p>
<p>Even so, it surprised some when today's AP Poll listed IU (21-3) ahead of Duke (21-2). The Blue Devils garnered 20 votes (to IU's 26) for the top spot, and the USA Today Coaches Poll had Duke at No. 1. Apparently, the Hoosiers' ability to remain atop the brutal Big Ten was enough to edge out Coach Krzyzewski's squad, which despite a better record, hasn't managed to lead their own conference.

<p>But there was another slam from the human highlight reel that you may have missed if you were among those revelling as Indiana appeared to dribble out the clock. With 1 second left and Michigan players walking over to shake hands with their opponents, Oladipo dribbled the ball in unguarded and delivered a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXGjitfEaDI" target="_blank">tomahawk jam</a> that some Michigan players felt was uncalled for. (Referees ultimately determined the clock had expired and did not count the basket.)

<p>As the <em>NYT</em>&nbsp;points out, Joani Crean has a pretty stressful week ahead with high-pressure IU games against Purdue and Michigan before her family leaves for New Orleans. If that weren't enough, she's also the singular embodiment of the irresistible intersection of two major national sports stories, the historic Har-Bowl and the media-darling Hoosiers. Still, while she might be the &ldquo;most anxiety-ridden sports fan in the United States this week,&rdquo; as the article says, she has to feel better than she did this time last year. Flash back 12 months: Both Harbaugh brothers lost their conference championship games on the same day, and IU was on a three-game buzzkill losing streak.</p>
<p>The article quotes the Hoosiers coach describing his wife as &ldquo;at least as competitive as her legendarily competitive brothers&rdquo; and says he thinks she &ldquo;could have been a C.E.O., or maybe an industrial psychologist.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=85317" target="_blank">This article</a> offers another peek into her personality.)

At 16-2, the team&rsquo;s only other misstep was against a surging <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8861779/hinkle-magic-butler-bulldogs-defeat-gonzaga-buzzer-beater-college-basketball" target="_blank">Butler</a> team that&rsquo;s now No. 9 in the nation. With a 3-0 record on the road in the Big Ten, the Hoosiers have already matched the total number of away victories they managed all last year in the conference. Sure, they&rsquo;ve slipped from a preseason No. 1 ranking to No. 7, but for much of the year, they've led the nation in a number of important categories: points scored, free throws made, and almost certainly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3esIT5R5I" target="_blank">highlight dunks</a> (thank you, Victor Oladipo).</p>
<p>So why do fans seem so worried? Because IU has shown vulnerabilities that typically keep teams from winning championships. First and foremost, the depth the Hoosiers were supposed to enjoy has proven to be rather shallow. <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/iu-basketball-inks-top-recruiting-class" target="_blank">"The Movement"</a> of star recruits has only produced one difference maker, and that&rsquo;s Yogi Ferrell (who himself is only averaging a little more than 6 points a game). High hopes for freshman-year contributions from Hanner Mosquera-Perea (who looks scared every time he takes the court), Jeremy Hollowell (who has a fondness for turnovers), and Peter Jurkin (who never plays at all) now appear quixotic. Add to that the injuries that have plagued Maurice Creek and Derek Elston, and you really have a six-man roster: The five starters and Will Sheehey.</p>
<p>Secondly, opponents have started to identify IU&rsquo;s one-dimensional players and schemes. If you can keep Jordan Hulls from shooting 3s, it&rsquo;s pretty clear he&rsquo;s not going to hurt you any other way. If you can slow the game down and keep the Hoosiers from racing up and down the court in transition (thrilling to watch), then coach Tom Crean&rsquo;s players often appear lost in the half-court game (especially against a <a href="http://www.insidethehall.com/2013/01/22/film-session-the-hoosiers-against-the-1-3-1/" target="_blank">1-3-1 defense</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, the schedule gets a lot worse from here. As much as the team must have enjoyed playing Big Ten bottom-dwellers like Northwestern and Penn State early in the year, now they face a late-season gauntlet: No. 13 Michigan State on Jan. 27, No. 2 Michigan on Feb. 2, No. 14 Ohio State on Feb. 10, Michigan State again on Feb. 19, No. 12 Minnesota on Feb. 26, and a brutal game at Michigan to end the season on March 10.</p>
<p>As my colleague, <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/01/16/the-naysayer-an-ugly-home-loss-for-iu" target="_blank">The Naysayer</a>, says, the Hoosiers are going to rack up six or seven losses. But there are encouraging signs, too. Cody Zeller, who seemed content to get his quiet 15 points a game early on has started to <a href="http://www.insidethehall.com/2013/01/21/five-takeaways-from-indianas-win-at-northwestern/" target="_blank">assert</a> himself more. Christian Watford, who has played pretty soft for a 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; power forward in years past, has started to take the ball to the rim in recent games. And Victor Oladipo has become IU&rsquo;s most-loved player since <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-boozer2320100707154243,0,4366431.photo" target="_blank">A.J. Moye</a>.</p>
<p>Cohesiveness, which was in such abundance last year but has often been mysteriously missing this season, will determine if the Hoosiers live up to expectations in March. Raw talent, as IU has already seen, won't be enough.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/01/22/a-tough-second-half-of-the-season-awaits-iu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/01/22/a-tough-second-half-of-the-season-awaits-iu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 16:13:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Daniel S.

<p>Indiana&rsquo;s loss to unranked Wisconsin at home is not the end of the world, but it gave Hoosier fans a glimpse of just how quickly the lofty expectations of a season can unravel. Let&rsquo;s face it: the Big Ten is a brutal conference. IU is going to rack up five or six losses and have a hard time maintaining a high ranking.</p>
<p>The Hoosiers&rsquo; second half performance was incredibly poor. Poor shooting, poor defense, poor passing, and poor substitution patterns among other poor play. (See Jordan Hulls&rsquo; stat sheet.) IU was lucky to be leading at halftime by one, and they collapsed in the second half. For all the air-time Victor Oladipo <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/the-tipoff/2013/01/12/oladipo-becomes-ius-most-buzzed-about-player" target="_blank">received in the first 20 minutes</a>, his name was conspicuously absent from the commentary when Wisconsin was building a 10-point second-half lead. The Badgers went seven minutes without a point and still maintained their advantage.</p>
<p>Plain and simple, IU lost its way in the second half. Cody Zeller scored 18 in the first half on 8-of-8 shooting from the field, then scored five late points in the second. Hulls decided that a fade-away jumper was the shot for him and ended the game with four points and the distinction of being a player who is shuffled on and off the court in late minutes because he can&rsquo;t play defense. I think Coach Tom Crean must be right: It&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TomCrean/status/217401451868196864" target="_blank">Hulls' haircut</a>&mdash;or lack thereof.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L-IGXFO4ky4?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>There are those who say that the Hoosiers suffered an "off" shooting night, that Indiana's <a href="http://www.insidethehall.com/2013/01/16/wisconsin-loss-is-alarming-but-no-reason-to-overreact/" target="_blank">inability to make shots</a> affected its offense. But not making shots has nothing to do with players standing around watching when they should have been running the offense. That&rsquo;s what stagnated IU. Zeller&rsquo;s first-half offense was superb but the Hoosiers never made it a second-half priority to get the ball inside to the big man. The way he dominated every Badger who tried to defend him in the first half, no offensive set should have been run in the second without Zeller touching the ball. This was a critical mistake. Instead, Hulls decided to heave fall-away jumpers in the lane.</p>
<p>The winner of the Big Ten will be a team like the Badgers that can score road wins and protect their own house. The problem is that by the end of the year, the highest ranked Big Ten team may not even be in the top 10. It&rsquo;s a good thing that IU has Penn State and Northwestern the next two games, although if the Hoosiers aren&rsquo;t careful, it could be a repeat of the Feb. 5, 2003, game when the Wildcats defeated the Hoosiers 74-61 at home for the first time in decades and the <em>Indianapolis Star</em> ran the headline: &ldquo;IU Hits Unimaginable Depth.&rdquo; Could this be Part Deux?</p>

The former is the actress perhaps best known for playing "Sally" to Billy Crystal's "Harry," and the latter is some local corn-fed guy who was born in a small town once upon a time and went on to warble about pink houses and two creatures named Jack and Diane.</p>
<p>"But don't call him Johnny Cougar," said Big Ten Network announcer Gus Johnson, in <a href="http://btn.com/2012/01/12/did-you-see-this-celebs-attend-iu-game/" target="_blank">admitting readily</a> to fellow commentator Jim Jackson that he has a fair number of Mellencamp tunes housed on his iPod. (Frankly, we're just glad to hear that Gus Johnson owns an iPod. See the video of the sighting and their exchange <a href="http://btn.com/2012/01/12/did-you-see-this-celebs-attend-iu-game/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The pair have been an item for years now, and regularly attend IU games in Bloomington. When IM last covered them, Mellencamp had feted his ladyfriend with <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/dish/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10317170" target="_blank">a 50th birthday party</a> in November 2011 at Dunaway's restaurant right here in downtown Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this coupling, IU fans and/or celebrity chasers?</p>

<p>Introducing Hoo-Bans, makeshift Ray-Ban sunglasses with IU's trademark candy stripes in the lenses. You can rock these for just $19.99 for the rest of this season and next and beyond. Order <a href="http://shop.a-maccessories.com/Candy-Striped-Hoo-Bans-SUHOOPH-562.htm" target="_blank">here</a> or see more info at the maker's <a href="http://www.a-maccessories.com/?utm_source=TeamMash&utm_campaign=a2de3cdd74-Hoo_Bans_launch1_7_2013&utm_medium=email" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>But don't stop there. Candy-striped leg warmers, infant and toddler dresses, rugby polos, ties, pants (duh), and more styles are also available, those at <a href="http://tisbookiu.com/MerchList.aspx?ID=22910" target="_blank">the T.I.S. site</a>.</p>
<p>Where does it end? IU fans are asking themselves that question right now in more ways than one.</p>
