I suggest actually sales, not just marketing, is critical, and highlight a couple examples &#8211; Vegas and Chicago &#8211; where we are seeing the start of a new recruiting approach. Here&#8217;s a sample:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The dominant talent paradigm in America today is &#8220;brain drain.&#8221; The idea is to prevent educated people, particularly the young who grew up or went to school in a particular place, from leaving.</p>
<p>This is a model with serious flaws. Notably it implies a sort of &#8220;wages fund&#8221; view of talent in which each community is endowed with a fixed reservoir of it and the goal is to prevent leakage. It downplays attraction, both &#8220;boomerangers&#8221; and true newcomers, and by implication suggests that there&#8217;s not much to recommend about a community if you didn&#8217;t grow up or go to school there. And it misses the point that in an ever more globalized, diverse, complex world, a place&#8217;s best interests are not well served by people who&#8217;ve never lived anywhere else.

<p>Like the captions say, the one on the left shows homicide rates by police district in the early 90s, when crime was at its peak in Chicago, and the one on the right shows the same thing, but about two decades later.* The areas in dark green are the safest; the ones in dark pink are the most dangerous. The colors are calibrated so that green areas are safer than average for the early 90s, and pink ones are more dangerous than average for the early 90s. The 2008-2011 map keeps the same calibration: green is safe <em>compared to the early 90s</em>, so that you can see change in the levels of violence over time.</p>
<p>And, indeed, the first thing that jumps out from these maps is that there&#8217;s way more green nowadays, and it tends to be darker. The city is way safer! Some areas we might consider a bit dicey today &#8211; like, say, the Lawndale/Little Village area &#8211; actually register as light green, meaning that by early 90s standards, they would be considered relatively safe.<i><br />
</i></p>
<p>[For those of you craving numbers, the murder rate averaged 30 per 100k during the first period, and 17 per 100k during the second, a decline of nearly 50%.]</p>
<p>Of course, the other thing we notice is that there are some very distinct patterns to safety. These maps are breaking exactly no news by indicating that the more dangerous parts of the city are on the West and South Sides, but it <em>is</em> striking, I think, to see that nowadays, basically the entire North Side is the darkest green, which translates to a homicide rate of less than 6 per 100k. In fact, the  dark-green part of the city has a murder rate of 3.3 per 100k.</p>
<p>Three point three. In New York City, which is constantly (and mostly correctly) being held up as proof that urban safety miracles can happen in America, it&#8217;s 6.3. Toronto, which as far as North American big cities go occupies a fairy tale land where no one hurts anybody, had a homicide rate of 3.3 per 100k as recently as 2007. The North Side is <em>unbelievably safe</em>, at least as far as murder goes.</p>
<p>But there are none of the darkest green on the West or South Sides. There&#8217;s actually a fair amount of pink, meaning places that are relatively dangerous even by the terrifying standards of the early 90s.</p>
<p>This raises a question: Has the great Crime Decline benefited the whole city equally? Are the South and West Sides still relatively dangerous because they started from such a bad place, or because they haven&#8217;t seen nearly as much of a decline as the North Side has?</p>
<p>Here is the answer in another map:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>CHANGE IN HOMICIDE RATE, EARLY 90s &#8211; LATE 2000s</strong></p>
<p><center><a href="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/murderchange1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178 aligncenter" alt="Murderchange" src="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/murderchange1-e1375601010679.png?w=251&#038;h=300" width="251" height="300" /></a></center></p>
<p>The areas in darkest green saw the greatest decline; red means the murder rate actually <i>increased</i>.</p>
<p>So: Yes, the great Crime Decline is a fickle thing. The North Side saw huge decreases (in Rogers Park, it was over 80%) pretty much everywhere; the few areas that are lighter green were the safest in the city to begin with. The parts of the South and West Sides closest to downtown &#8211; Bronzeville, the West Loop, Pilsen, etc. &#8211; got a lot safer. But <em>most of the rest actually got worse</em>, including some neighborhoods that were already among the most dangerous in the city, like Englewood and Garfield Park.</p>
<p>This is a complicated state of affairs, and probably goes at least part of the way to explaining why, in the face of a 50% decrease in homicides citywide over the last two decades, many people persist in believing that the opposite is true: because in their neighborhoods, <em>it is</em>. It&#8217;s a dynamic that defies an easy narrative, and makes me slightly less angry (though only slightly) at all those journalists who have written in the last year or two about murder in Chicago without mentioning that the city is, in fact, safer on the whole than it has been in fifty years.</p>
<p>Here is one final pair of maps:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>RATIO OF POLICE DISTRICT HOMICIDE RATE TO CITY AVERAGE</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homicideratios90s.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-182" alt="Homicideratios90s" src="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homicideratios90s-e1375601429969.png?w=245&#038;h=300" width="245" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homicideratio2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-183" alt="homicideratio2" src="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homicideratio2-e1375601409564.png?w=246&#038;h=300" width="246" height="300" /></a></p>
<table width="575">
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>1990-1993</strong></td>
<td align="center"><strong>2008-2011</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is slightly less intuitive. These maps show the how the homicide rate in any given police district compares to the citywide average, using ratios; for example, if the homicide rate in West Town is 10 per 100k, and citywide it&#8217;s 5 per 100k, West Town&#8217;s ratio is 2 to 1. If West Town were 2.5 per 100k, its ratio would be 0.5 to 1. (Obviously the numbers in these examples are made up.) Blue areas have ratios below 1, and so are relatively safe; red ones above 1, and are relatively dangerous.</p>
<p>With the help of these maps, I&#8217;m going to ignore what I said about all this defying an easy narrative, and try to supply one: Over the last twenty years, at the same time as overall crime has declined, the <em>inequality of violence</em> <em>in Chicago has skyrocketed. </em>The pattern of what&#8217;s blue and what&#8217;s red in each map is mostly the same; I count only three out of twenty-five districts that switched from one color to another. <em>But the colors are much darker in the 2000s than they were in the 1990s.</em> There have always been safer and more dangerous areas here, as there are everywhere; but the gap between them is way, way bigger now than it used to be.</p>
<p>Numbers will help this case. Imagine that for each of these two time periods, we cut the city into equal thirds: one contains the most dangerous neighborhoods; another, the safest; and the last, everything else. In the early 90s, the most dangerous third of the city had about six times as many murders as the safest third. By the late 2000s, the most dangerous part of the city had nearly <em>fifteen times</em><em> more homicides</em> than the safest third.</p>
<p>In addition, here are two charts (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homratio90.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-199 aligncenter" alt="HomRatio90" src="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homratio90.png" width="575" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homratio201.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-203 aligncenter" alt="Homratio20" src="http://danielhertz.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/homratio201.png" width="575" /></a></p>
<p>The divergence is self-evident. The early 90s look very roughly like a normal curve: most neighborhoods are in the middle, and there&#8217;s a clear, if slightly bumpy, slope down towards the extremes.</p>
<p>Today, any semblance of a normal curve has been annihilated. Or, actually, that&#8217;s not quite right. Now it looks like there might be <em>two completely separate normal curves</em>, one with a peak at 0.2-0.4, and the other peaking at 3.1-4. Plus a few guys who got lost in the middle.</p>
<p>I suppose there are many, many things that one might say about what this means, but here&#8217;s the bottom line: The disadvantages and tragedies that people in &#8220;dangerous&#8221; neighborhoods experience are both absolute and relative. The death of an innocent person** is an indescribable loss no matter what. And, on that count, things are somewhat better for Chicago&#8217;s most violent areas: the homicide rate for the most dangerous third of the city declined from 51 to 39 per 100k in the time period we&#8217;ve looked at here. That is a real accomplishment, and hundreds, if not thousands, of people are still with their families and friends because of it.</p>
<p>But in other ways, it does matter if other parts of the city are getting safer much, much faster. When people weigh safety in their decisions about where to live, they do so by comparing: How much safety am I gaining by living in one neighborhood versus another? The same is true of entrepreneurs considering where to open their next business. The same is true of tourists looking to explore the city. The same is true of locals looking to travel to another neighborhood to eat out or go shopping.</p>
<p>On every one of those counts, the disadvantages that are accruing to already-disadvantaged neighborhoods in terms of lost population, investment, and connections to the rest of the city are now much more severe. The hurdles are that much higher.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bad for those physical neighborhoods. It&#8217;s also terrible for the people who have good reasons to live there, like social networks, nearby family, or the affordability of real estate.</p>
<p>Because I don&#8217;t have the data in front of me, but who would doubt that over these same twenty years, there has also been a growing gap between how much it costs to live on the safe North Side compared to the more dangerous parts of the South and West Sides? Who would doubt that, as the North Side reaches Toronto-level peacefulness, the cost of rent has greatly diminished the number of apartments there affordable to the poor and working class?</p>
<p>In other words, just as the stakes have been tripled as to whether you live in Relatively Safe Chicago or Relatively Dangerous Chicago, it has become much, much harder to establish yourself on the winning side.</p>
<p>So: Next time you hear someone talking about &#8220;record violence&#8221; in the city, tell them that actually, murders are down almost 50% from twenty years ago. And then tell them that what&#8217;s <em>really </em>alarming is murder inequality.</p>
<p>* Why does this data end in 2011? Because I made these maps using data from the Chicago Police Department annual reports, which are available online, and which only broke down crimes by police district in the 1990s. In 2012, the police district boundaries changed, making it not quite an apples-to-apples comparison to prior years. Maybe somewhere data exists by Community Area for the early 90s, and then I could redo all of this.</p>
<p>** And I think reporting like that done by This American Life at Harper High in Englewood ought to challenge conventional middle-class ideas about &#8220;innocence&#8221; in the ghetto. It is very easy for those who don&#8217;t live in the neighborhood to talk about &#8220;thugs&#8221; and &#8220;gangsters&#8221; getting what they deserve. It is also very cruel, and very naive about what exactly &#8220;gangs&#8221; are, and what kind of people join one, and how, and why.</p>

<p>But while commentators try to outdo each other in heaping condemnation on the players, let&#8217;s not forget that the real scandal is the staggering sums of taxpayer money spent to subsidize new stadiums for billionaire team owners at a time when other infrastructure has been crumbling and cities have been cutting back on basic services. (Hey, a bunch of mostly brown-skinned people get the book thrown at them for using drugs while a bunch of rich white dudes get away scot-free with pillaging the public purse&#8230;where have I heard that one before???)</p>
<p>Virtually every baseball team has gotten a new stadium in recent years, with <a href="http://www.american.com/archive/2008/april-04-08/a-closer-look-at-stadium-subsidies">subsidies averaging over $250 million each</a>. This plus <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/09/05/801341/america-4-billion-sports-stadiums/">$4 billion in forgone taxes on bonds</a> issued to pay for them.  As has been repeatedly shown by economists, there is no way to justify these investments on an ROI basis.</p>
<p>Consider this partial list of headline public subsidies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miller Park (home to the Milwaukee Brewers, which Commissioner Bud Selig once owned): $290 million</li>
<li>Great American Ball Park (Cincinnati Reds): $290 million (built at part of a two-fer that has caused <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704461304576216330349497852.html">massive problems for taxpayers</a>)</li>
<li>Yankee Stadium: $550 million (at least &#8211; the public is <a href="http://observer.com/2009/01/ibo-new-yankee-stadium-costing-city-state-528-m/">coughing up $1.2 billion</a> for both NYC baseball stadiums, factoring in tax exempt bonds and other favors)</li>
<li>PNC Park (Pittsburgh Pirates): $228 million</li>
<li>Marlins Park: $347 million (a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2013/02/21/will-an-empty-marlins-park-create-backlash-against-sports-stadium-subsidies/">particularly sad case</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not going to say that every single case of a city spending on a sports team is bad. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2009/11/08/pro-sports-as-naming-rights-deal/">argued myself</a> that these should be analyzed at some level as a naming-rights deal, in which the city is paying for the privilege of putting its name on the team. So some outsized spending may be worth it for branding purposes for small cities, but this can&#8217;t be the case everywhere.</p>
<p>In any event, the sums spent subsidizing billionaire team owners to grace our cities with the presence of their personally lucrative businesses is pretty staggering. Remember this the next time your local government cries poverty when it comes to investments that actually benefit the public. Though not baseball, the state of Michigan is <a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20130724/NEWS/130729926/state-approves-450m-in-bonds-for-red-wings-arena#">pumping $450 million</a> into a new downtown arena in bankrupt Detroit for the Red Wings &#8211; that&#8217;ll help. Chicago is laying off teachers, closing 50 schools, and has pension funds that are less than half of where they should be, but still managed to <a href="http://college-basketball.si.com/2013/05/30/the-obvious-lunacy-of-depauls-new-arena-plan/">find $100 million</a> for a new DePaul basketball arena?  When will the madness end?</p>

It&#8217;s called &#8220;<a href="http://www.publicsectorinc.com/psi_articles/2013/08/why-cities-give-republicans-the-brush-off.html">Why Cities Give Republicans the Brush-Off</a>&#8221; and looks at why the Republican disinterest in providing services &#8211; and in general anything other than budget cutting &#8211; makes their message irrelevant to cities and much of local government in general. Here&#8217;s a sample:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Under Tea Party influence and opposition to President Obama, Republicans have come increasingly to view government purely as a fiscal machine, and their guiding ambition is simply to reduce the amount of money flowing through it. Ronald Reagan, though not a Tea Partier himself, succinctly expressed this attitude when he famously said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I&#8217;m from the government and I&#8217;m here to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>This message doesn’t work at the local level. Most city dwellers are happy, not terrified, to see the fire department, or an EMS crew, or even a garbage truck, show up to help&#8230;.Urban voters tend be less outraged at how much their government is spending (though they care about that, too) than about how poorly it delivers services.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Recently Detroit, under orders from a state-appointed emergency manager, became the largest U.S. city to go bankrupt. This stirred predictable media speculation about why the city, which at 1.8 million was once America’s 5th-largest, declined in the first place. Much of the coverage simply listed Detroit’s longtime problems rather than explaining their causes. For example a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/detroit-decline-cause-auto-industry-segregation-race_n_3635818.html ">Huffington Post article</a> asserted that it was because of “racial strife,” the loss of “good-paying [sic] assembly line jobs,” and a population who fled “to pursue new dreams in the suburbs.” Paul Krugman, who has increasingly become America’s dean of misguided thinking, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/krugman-detroit-the-new-greece.html?ref=paulkrugman&#038;_r=1&#038;">downplayed the city’s pension obligations</a>, instead blaming “job sprawl” and “market forces.” The implication is that Detroit’s problem just arose organically from structural economic changes, and within decades somehow produced a city of abandoned homes and unlit streets. </p>
<p>But a closer look suggests that Detroit’s problems, which include 16% unemployment, 36% poverty, and 60% population decline, were self-inflicted by a half-century of government excess. Thomas Sowell <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2011/03/22/obama_adminstration_is_following_the_detroit_pattern">nicknamed this excessiveness</a> the “Detroit Pattern”, and defined it as the city’s habit for “increasing taxes, harassing businesses, and pandering to unions.” These three problems have proven as instrumental to decline as the “Big Three” automakers once were to Detroit’s rise. Analyzing their background, and potential for reform, could expedite the city’s turnaround. </p>
<p>The foremost measure would be addressing taxes. Currently Detroit has one of America’s largest tax burdens for major cities, offering notoriously bad services in return (police response times average 58 minutes, and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2013/06/15/the-1-25-billion-price-tag-for-fixing-detroit/">40% of streetlights do not work</a>). Its property tax rates are <a href="http://finance.townhall.com/columnists/chrisedwards/2013/07/29/detroits-high-property-taxes-n1651149">the nation’s highest</a>, exceeding 4% for some buildings. This has caused particular disinvestment in the city’s large stock of abandoned homes, some of which sell for below $1000, but are avoided since they get <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130614/METRO01/306140083#ixzz2WDtZocth ">assessed at far above their actual worth</a>, leaving owners with inflated tabs.</p>
<p>Detroit could also help its cause with a business climate that better encouraged entrepreneurship. For decades it has done the opposite, championing a growth policy that mirrored the city’s overly-centralized private sector. It has gambled—with tax breaks, subsidies, and extensive eminent domain—on stadiums, casinos, office towers, factories, and a downtown monorail, only to find that these didn’t produce nearly the anticipated benefits. Meanwhile it has squelched small businesses, which are generally better at creating jobs, with a cobweb of protectionist regulations—on food trucks, taxis, movie theaters, and so on. This was summarized in economist Dean Stansel’s recent <a href="http://www.jrap-journal.org/pastvolumes/2010/v43/v43_n1_a2_stansel.pdf ">“economic freedom” study</a>, which ranked the regulatory and tax climates of U.S. metro areas. In a field of 384, Detroit placed 345th. </p>
<p>These regulations have emanated from Detroit’s vast, union-controlled public bureaucracy. Recent debate about this bureaucracy has focused on retirement benefits, which apologists note are far less generous than in other big cities. But this does not detract from the sheer number of retirees, which at 20,000 are <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-your-pension-disappear-post-detroit-2013-07-24">nearly twice Detroit’s existing public workforce</a>, and account for obligations of potentially half the city’s $18 billion debt. </p>
<p>Less discussed is the way unions protect existing workers also, by stifling needed service reforms. When a philanthropist offered $200 million in 1999 to open the city’s first charter school, which would require changes to state law, the Detroit Federation of Teachers organized a work stoppage to protest in Lansing, ultimately causing <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,526339,00.html">withdraw of the donation</a>. Various other city unions (which total 47) have resisted reduction or privatization of water utilities, trash-pickup, street lighting, and transportation. This is despite the city having proven wildly incompetent at providing these services itself, a point <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323829104578623422748612116-lMyQjAxMTAzMDMwMDEzNDAyWj.html">made recently in the Wall Street Journal</a> by a former transportation chief. He claimed that unionization of the 1,400-employee DDOT had ensured worker protections for rampant absenteeism and poor performance, thus creating a climate in which 20% of scheduled buses did not arrive. Similar protections from firings and layoffs existed in other city departments, he wrote, perhaps explaining why Detroit, at over 10,000 workers, remains <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20110425/METRO01/104250352">one of the most overstaffed big cities in America</a>, while managing to do so little with them. </p>
<p>Of course many would argue that Detroit’s post-World War II racial conflicts were the real reasons for decline. More plausible is that these conflicts were inflamed by that era’s top-down government policies, which became all the worse when enforced by seemingly prejudiced officials. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s white mayors steamrolled roadways through functioning black neighborhoods like Black Bottom, and housed the displaced in dangerous, high-rise government projects. Funding for this and other “urban renewal” came from federal programs like President Johnson’s Model Cities, and using Detroit as a flagship, was meant to modernize aging urban communities. But the programs instead fragmented them, including a Detroit black population that, according to Sowell, then had 3.4% unemployment and “the highest rate of home-ownership of any black urban population in the country.” For them this “renewal” created a housing shortage, and along with discrimination and police brutality, <a href="http://www.67riots.rutgers.edu/d_index.htm">inspired riots in 1967</a>. </p>
<p>These riots killed dozens, injured nearly 1,200, and along with the ones inspired by Martin Luther King’s assassination, immediately spurred a mass white exodus. This cemented the demographic changes needed for both the 1973 election of Detroit’s first black mayor, Coleman Young, and subsequent policies that instead targeted the city’s whites. A <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/curley_effect_1.pdf">paper by economist Edward Glaeser</a> argues that this was done intentionally by Young as a way to further drive political rivals to the suburbs, and increase the share of his poor black voting base. He did this, writes Glaeser, by cutting off services in white neighborhoods, imposing onerous taxes, and displacing thousands of Polish households for a GM factory in the Poletown neighborhood. This led to further white exodus and diminishment of the tax base.</p>
<p>All these are examples of rampant abuses, under both black and white leadership, that have resulted because of Detroit’s notorious governing “pattern.” But one silver lining of its bankruptcy is the opportunity for structural change. This could occur by channeling the urban reforms—from charter schools, to defined-contribution pensions, to looser permitting, to plain-old lower taxes—that have helped other U.S. cities the last two decades. If these reforms can thrive in the Motor City than they probably can anywhere, turning it at the very least back into a functioning city, and at best into a reemerging economic star. </p>

<p>We hear a lot of talk these days about so-called &#8220;global cities.&#8221; But what is a global city?</p>
<p>Saskia Sassen literally <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Global-City-York-London-Tokyo/dp/0691070636/">wrote the book</a> on global cities back in 2001 (though her global cities work dates back well over a decade prior to that book). She gave a definition that has long struck with me. In short form, in the age of globalization, the activities of production are scattered on a global basis. These complex, globalized production networks require new forms of financial and producer services to manage them. These services are often complex and require highly specialized skills. Thus they are subject to agglomeration economics, and tend to cluster in a limited number of cities. Because specialized talent and firms related to different specialties can cluster in different cities, this means that there are actually a quite a few of these specialized production nodes, because they don&#8217;t necessarily directly compete with each other, having different groupings of specialties. </p>
<p>In this world then, a global city is a significant production point of specialized financial and producer services that make the globalized economy run. Sassen covered specifically New York, London, and Tokyo in her book, but there are many more global cities than this.</p>
<p>The question then becomes how to identify these cities, and perhaps to determine to what extent they function as global cities specifically, beyond all of the other things that they do simply as cities. Naturally this lends itself to our modern desire to develop league tables.</p>
<p>A number of studies were undertaken to produce various rankings. However, when you look at them, you see that the definition of global city used is far broader than Sassen&#8217;s core version. Wikipedia lists some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city">general characteristics</a> people tend to refer to when talking about global cities.  It cites a very lengthy list, but some of them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home to major stock exchanges and indexes</li>
<li>Influential in international political affairs</li>
<li>Home to world-renowned cultural institutions</li>
<li>Service a major media hub</li>
<li>Large mass transit networks</li>
<li>Home to a large international airport</li>
<li>Having a prominent skyline</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this is quite a hodge-podge of items, many of which are only tangentially related to globalization per se. In effect, many of them seek to define cities only in term of global prominence rather than functionally as related to the global economy.  That&#8217;s certainly a valid way to look at it, but it raises the point that we should probably clarify what we are talking about when we talk about global cities.</p>
<p>To clarify our thinking, let&#8217;s look at how various ranking studies have defined global city for their purposes.</p>
<p>One oft-cited such ranking was a 1999 research paper called <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb5.html">A Roster of World Cities</a>.  The authors, Jon Beaverstock, Richard G. Smith and Peter J. Taylor, explicitly reference Sassen&#8217;s work, seeking to define global cities in terms of advanced producer services. </p>
<blockquote><p>
Taking our cue from Sassen (1991, 126), we treat world cities as particular &#8216;postindustrial production sites&#8217; where innovations in corporate services and finance have been integral to the recent restructuring of the world-economy now widely known as globalization. Services, both directly for consumers and for firms producing other goods for consumers, are common to all cities of course, what we are dealing with here are generally referred to as advanced producer services or corporate services. The key point is that many of these services are by no means so ubiquitous; for Sassen they provide a limited number of leading cities with &#8216;a specific role in the current phase of the world economy&#8217; (p. 126).
</p></blockquote>
<p>They took lists of firms in four specific service industries &#8211; accounting, advertising, banking, and law &#8211; and determined where those firms maintained branches and such around the world in order to determine the importance of various cities as production nodes of these services.  This has some weaknesses in that it doesn&#8217;t necessarily distinguish whether say a particular accounting firm is doing routine type work of the sort accountants have always been doing, or performing advanced work of a type specific to globalization, but it at least tries to derive lists related to the production of services.</p>
<p>As the global city concept grew in popularity, various other organizations entered the fray. Most of these newer lists take a very different a much broader approach closer to the Wikipedia type lists of characteristics rather than a Sassen-like definition.</p>
<p>One example is AT Kearney&#8217;s list, developed in conjunction with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Their most recent version is the <a href="http://www.atkearney.com/images/global/pdf/2012_Global_Cities_Index_and_Emerging_Cities_Outlook-FINAL3.pdf">2012 Global Cities Index</a>.  This study uses criteria across five dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Activity (headquarters, services firms, capital markets value, number of international conferences, value of goods through ports and airports)</li>
<li>Human Capital (size of foreign born population, quality of universities, number of international schools, international student population, number of residents with college degrees)</li>
<li>Information Exchange (accessibility of major TV news channels, Internet presence (basically number of search hits), number of international news bureaus, censorship, and broadband subscriber rate)</li>
<li>Cultural Experience (number of sporting event, museums, performing arts venues, culinary establishments, international visitors, and sister city relationships).</li>
<li>Political Engagement (number of embassies and consulates, think tanks, international organizations, political conferences)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Institute for Urban Strategies at The Mori Memorial Foundation in Tokyo published another study called &#8220;<a href="http://www.mori-m-foundation.or.jp/english/research/project/6/pdf/GPCI2011_English.pdf">The Global Power City Index 2011</a>.&#8221;  This report examined cities in terms of functions demanded by several &#8220;actor&#8221; types: Manager, Researcher, Artist, Visitor, and Resident.  The functional areas were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economy (Market Attractiveness, Economic Vitality, Business Environment, Regulations and Risk)</li>
<li>Research and Development (Research Background, Readiness for Accepting and Supporting Researchers, Research Achievement)</li>
<li>Cultural Interaction (Trendsetting Potential, Accommodation Environment, Resources of Attracting Visitors, Dining and Shopping, Volume of Interaction)</li>
<li>Livability (Working Environment, Cost of Living, Security and Safety, Life Support Functions)</li>
<li>Environment (Ecology, Pollution, Natural Environment)</li>
<li>Accessibility (International Transportation Infrastructure, Inner City Transportation Infrastructure)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another popular ranking is the Economist Intelligence Unit&#8217;s <a href="http://www.managementthinking.eiu.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Hot%20Spots.pdf">Global City Competitiveness Index</a>.  They rank cities on a number of domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic Strength (Nominal GDP, per capita GDP, % of households with economic consumption > $14,000/yr, real GDP growth rate, regional market integration)</li>
<li>Human Capital (population growth, working age population, entrepreneurship and risk taking mindset, quality of education, quality of healthcare, hiring of foreign nationals)</li>
<li>Institutional Effectiveness (electoral process and pluralism, local government fiscal autonomy, taxation, rule of law, government effectiveness)</li>
<li>Financial Maturity (breadth and depth of financial cluster)</li>
<li>Global Appeal (Fortune 500 companies, frequency of international flights, international conferences and conventions, leadership in higher education, renowned think tanks)</li>
<li>Physical Capital (physical nfrastructure quality, public transport quality, telecom quality)</li>
<li>Environment and Natural Hazards (risk of natural disaster, environmental governance)</li>
<li>Social and Cultural Character (freedom of expression and human rights, openness and diversity, crime, cultural vibrancy)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these were not all equal weighted. Economic strength is paramount.</p>
<p>Yet another ranking comes from the Knight Frank/Citibank <a href="http://www.thewealthreport.net/The-Wealth-Report-2012.pdf">Wealth Report</a>.  This ranking is purely subjective and was based on surveying wealth advisors as to which cities they felt would be most important to their clients today and in the future based on four areas: economic activity, political power, knowledge and influence, and quality of life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Sassen contributed to various of these surveys. </p>
<p>Looking at the newer surveys versus the Roster of World Cities, it&#8217;s clear that the game has changed. Rather than attempting to look at specific global economic functions, the global city game has become effectively a balanced scorecard attempt to determine, as I like to put it, the world&#8217;s &#8220;biggest and baddest&#8221; cities. </p>
<p>There are quite a few differences in methodologies, which is inevitable. But a few things jump out at me. First the focus on aggregate measures in these surveys. For example: total GDP, total foreign population, number of headquarters. There is a remarkable lack of attention to dynamism variables such as growth in various metrics, though the Economist survey includes a couple.</p>
<p>The focus on static totals versus dynamism tends to reward large, developed world cities versus rapidly growing or emerging market cities. (The AT Kearney survey has a separate emerging cities list).  In a sense, these rankings are biased in favor of important legacy cities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to see what was included vs. not included in quality of life type ratings.  For example, items like censorship, media access, the rule of law, and the environment are listed. But measures of upward social-economic mobility or income inequality or not. </p>
<p>Lastly, a number of the rankings suggest a self-consciously elite mindset, such as shopping and dining options. As with many quality of life surveys, these seem to orient them towards expatriate executive types rather than normal folks.</p>
<p>Looking at these, I can&#8217;t help but think that the criteria were the product of an iterative process where the results were refined over time. Thus in a sense the outcomes were likely somewhat pre-determined. That&#8217;s not to say that the game was rigged necessarily. But I suspect if anyone were doing a global city survey and London and New York did not rank at the top, the developers would question whether they got the criteria right. In a sense, a global city is like obscenity: we know one when we see it, but we don&#8217;t necessarily have a widely agreed upon objective set of criteria to measure it by. </p>
<p>I sense that these rankings attempt to look at global cities in four basic ways:</p>
<p>1. <u>Advanced producer services production node</u>.  This is basically Sassen&#8217;s original definition. I think this one remains particularly important. Because the skills are specialized and subject to clustering economics, the cities that concentrate in these functions have a Buffett-like &#8220;wide moat&#8221; sustainable competitive advantage in particular very high value activities. For cities with large concentrations of these, those cities can generate significantly above average economic output and incomes per worker.</p>
<p>2. <u>Economic giants</u>.  Namely, this is a fairly simple but important view of that simply measures how big cities are on some metrics like GDP. </p>
<p>3. <u>International Gateway</u>. Measures of the importance of a city in the international flows of people and goods. Examples would be the airport and cargo gateway figures.</p>
<p>4. <u>Political and Cultural Hub</u>.  An important distinction should perhaps be made here between hubs that may be large but of primarily national or regional importance, and those of truly international significance. For example, there are many media hubs around the world, but few of them are home to outlets like the BBC that drive the global conversation.</p>
<p>There may potentially be other ways to slice it as well.  The fact that these various ways of viewing cities can often overlap can confuse things I think.  For example, New York and London score highly on all of these.  And there are surely underlying reasons why they do.  Yet trying to sum it all up into one overall ranking or score, while making it easy to get press, can end up obscuring important nuance.</p>
<p>So when thinking about global cities, I think we need to do a couple of things:</p>
<p>1. Clarify what it is we are talking about at the time.<br />
2. Relative to the definition we are using, seek to identify the specific parts of the city in question that generate real above average value at the global level. </p>
