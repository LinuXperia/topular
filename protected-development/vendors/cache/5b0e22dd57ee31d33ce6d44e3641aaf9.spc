Social media is not about advertising, nor is it about being that pushy sales guy that is constantly talking about how awesome their products or services are. Social media is about building relationships with those individuals that we care to listen to.</p>
<p><b>Don’t be that guy (or girl).<br />
</b>We’ve all been to parties before and have had the pleasure of engaging in small talk with numerous individuals that we’ve never spoken to before. Let’s think about those conversations that we’ve had for a moment. I’m sure we’ve all talked to that one person who never stops talking about themselves, and before you know it, you’ve heard their whole life story and are quickly searching for the nearest person who would be your way out of the conversation. Likewise, I’m sure we’ve also had those meaningful conversations with people where you swap stories about things that you are interested in. The conversation keeps going and the more you talk to this person, the more you realize how much you have in common.</p>
<p>Like the party, social media is a very similar virtual concept. Your followers don&#8217;t want to listen to the companies that &#8220;hog&#8221; the conversation and just talk about themselves. If your company does, you run the risk of potentially turning off your followers and being labeled as too “sales-y”.</p>
<p><b>Don’t monitor&#8212; listen. Listen often.<br />
</b><a title="Dave Kerpen" href="http://www.davekerpen.com/" target="_blank">Dave Kerpen</a>, author of <em><a title="Likeable Social Media" href="http://www.amazon.com/Likeable-Social-Media-Customers-Irresistible/dp/0071762345" target="_blank">Likeable Social Media</a></em>, says that many people use the word monitoring and listening interchangeably, but both have very different meanings. Monitoring has a bit of a creep factor to it, whereas listening has a human process behind it. Think about it. Would you rather have a company say, <em>“I’m going to monitor you.”</em> Or <em>“I’m going to listen to you.”</em> You don’t want to just monitor someone. It’s like you’re a stalker. You want to listen to people. Listen and join in on the conversation. Don’t try and sell. It’s about having a conversation with people, much like you would at a party.</p>
<p><b>Invest in the right tools.<br />
</b>How do you listen and join in on the conversation? Sure, you follow people, but if your feeds and streams are like ours, they change every minute with hundreds of updates. Your company will need a tool that will allow you to filter out the noise and hone in on what you are really interested in listening to. Luckily for us, Hubspot, our <a title="all-in-one marketing software" href="http://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank">all-in-one marketing software</a>, has recently rolled out social monitoring, a tool that allows you to search for keywords or phrases, listen, and join in on the conversation. If you aren’t a current Hubspot user, that’s okay. There are other tools out there that will allow you to do some of the same things for almost free. Google Alerts and the Twitter and Facebook search are a few of the free options. Hubspot, Vocus, and Radian6 are more advanced and require a monthly service fee.</p>
<p><b>You’re listening now, right?<br />
</b>So now that you are listening, it’s time to put your social media handles and pages to good use. Start listening for things that interest your company. For example, my in-laws recently purchased a refrigerator from Sears. When they had it delivered and set up, after 24 hours, it stopped working. Frustrated, they called the Sears Customer Service line and explained their situation to the company. The rep on the other line said that they could get another one, but it’s backordered and would take 6 weeks to deliver. 6 weeks? Are they serious? Who could be without a refrigerator for 6 weeks? Even more frustrating, the CS rep offered no other solutions or alternatives. Instead, they got the good old fashion, <em>“Is there anything else I can help you with?”</em> scripted line. Um… NO!</p>
<p>Lucky for them and my own social media savviness, I took to social media and vented their frustration. The tweet went like this, <strong><em>“Wow @Sears! You deliver a broken fridge that is brand new &amp; say you can&#8217;t replace it til end of Oct? No other solution offered? Lost our biz!”</em></strong></p>
<p>Within minutes, I had an alert from Sears that simply stated, <strong><em>“@boldthink Sorry for the fridge trouble. We can help you! Please DM us your contact information and we will call you. Thanks-Mike cc:@Sears”</em></strong></p>
<p>I felt better already and so did my in-laws! Someone was actually listening! Better yet, there was a name tied to it. I sent a DM with my in-laws phone number and they had a brand new fridge delivered the next day. It was a different model, but an alternative solution that was just as good.</p>
<p><b>You’ve got unlimited knowledge in your hands.<br />
</b>There is so much yet to learn about the reach and power of social media. Billions of users use social media each year, just talking in an open fashion, about their everyday lives. Think of the research we have at our disposal for free. Search for certain keywords and phrases that would interest your company. Tap into this powerful resource and discover what people want, have problems with, and love to talk about.</p>
<p>How can you best leverage that for your company? We’d love to hear from you.</p>

I’m about to quickly explain to you what inbound links are and how you can build inbound links to your website.</p>
<p><b>What is an inbound link?<br />
</b>In short, an inbound link is basically another link to another website. For example, this is a link to a referral partner of mine that does <a title="advertising specialties" href="http://www.advertisingspec.com" target="_blank">promotional products</a> (You’re welcome, Advertising Specialties!). This link will take you from our Boldthink website to another website.</p>
<p><b>Why are inbound links important?<br />
</b>Inbound links do a couple of things. First, it’s a great way to get referral traffic. When you give someone an inbound link and refer a potential reader, it’s a great way to build reciprocity.  Second, it gives SEO a bit of a boost. Websites built with rich inbound links naturally rank better. When your website works alone with no inbound links, it may not generate much interest. However, when you start adding in links, your website becomes a valuable source of information. You can also think of inbound links as your online referral networking tool.</p>
<p><b>Not all inbound links are valuable.</b><br />
Full disclosure: not all inbound links are created equal. The website that you are getting inbound links for need to have some authoritative rank. This is where many websites get in trouble with blackhat SEO tactics. You cannot buy inbound links. You need to build them from sites that are credible. For example, asking for a link on someone’s food blog that they do on a part time basis will not have much website authority compared to that of Inc., an online resource for small businesses.</p>
<p><b>How to build valuable inbound links.<br />
</b>Building inbound links is crucial for any SEO strategy. When beginning your inbound link strategy, here are a few easy ways to build valuable links:</p>
<ol>
<li>Link to websites in complementary industries. Naturally, when you link with similar companies because it solidifies the obvious relationship between the two websites.</li>
<li>Be a guest blogger on another website.</li>
<li>Link to your clients/partners and ask for a backlink on their website. This is common in the B2B industry because everyone has a vested interest in the success of each other’s business.</li>
<li>Create a joint press release. For example, maybe you got a new client or formed a new partnership. This is a great opportunity for both parties involved to give an inbound link.</li>
<li>Have a blog. This is a great way to continuously get inbound links. Be sure to push out all your posts using social media to get the most value out of our content.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of ways to start building your inbound link strategy. What tactics have you used on your website?</p>

This is both good and bad for those of you who already have a website. It’s good (actually great) because only the most credible websites that contain the most valuable information rank at the top. Spam websites are no longer able to fill their website with keywords that aren’t relevant and take the top rankings, and you can no longer fake having the best website by adding meta-tags. The bad news is that it isn’t easy to rank now for those of you who are relying on old SEO tactics and haven’t updated your website in years.</p>
<p>Many businesses are finding that their website has actually dropped in rankings. I’ve had many of our own prospective leads tell me that they used to be ranked on page one and two a few years ago, but over the past several months, they’ve noticed a tremendous decline. In haste, those in charge of keeping up the website are actually applying old SEO strategies that can now actually hurt the website and have the opposite effect. Instead of increasing in rankings, they are actually decreasing, or worse yet, not showing up at all. If you are wondering why your website isn&#8217;t ranking in search engines, we may have some answers.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the deal?</strong></p>
<p>Google, along with other major search engines, have changed their algorithms. An algorithm is basically a very complex formula that they use to calculate which website actually ranks on top. Prior to this change, rankings greatly depended on links and meta-tags. Today, rankings are based on relevant content. As the old saying goes, “he with the most valuable content wins.” (Okay, maybe that’s my version!)</p>
<p>In order to have a chance in ranking high in search engines, you must be creating great content. Though many companies understand this, they often get frustrated because they eventually realize that creating quality content that generates the right kind of leads and allows you to rank takes a lot of time. Instead, they half-ass it, and create content that actually takes away from the value of their website. This can lead to many problems. First, their customers or clients will eventually realize that they have nothing important to say and will stop relying on them for valuable information related to their business. Second, what makes matters worse is that they will no longer share the information with their own network of friends and family. They may even go elsewhere to get the information that they need, which may include going to a competitor, but even more problematic is that companies really do need their information shared in order for search engines to realize the value of their website. If your content isn’t being shared and no one is reading your blog or website pages, what’s the point? And that is exactly what search engines think too!</p>
<p><strong>So how do you create great content that is being shared, thus helping search engine rankings?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, follow the KISS rule (keep it simple sally). You don’t need to write a book or do loads of research that takes hours to create quality content. Here are some other tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your content to a minimum&#8212; 400 to 600 words will do just fine.</li>
<li>Keep it related to what you are selling. There is no need to write about cooking when you are a veterinarian. Instead, write about things that are industry related such as the best types of organic pet food, the best resources on keeping your pets healthy, etc… These should be things that you already know but just need to put down on paper.</li>
<li>Don’t overload your content with keywords. This is a huge problem for many companies. They think that filling their page with keywords will help with SEO. Instead, websites will actually get dinged. Search engines will calculate a website’s keyword use. If keywords are used too many times, the website will go down in search engine rankings.</li>
<li>Write authentically. You can avoid most problems related to bad SEO tactics by just being authentic in your writing. If you think about it, it’s completely unnatural to use the same word twenty times in your content. By writing authentically and in a style that comes naturally to us, we churn out better content.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that creating quality content takes time. It’s often a struggle for many of us to make the time and devote it to writing. If you look at it this way, there are forty hours in a given workweek. Take three of those hours and devote them to improving your search engine rankings. It’s not always enough, but it’s most certainly enough time for you to start seeing improvements in your rankings.</p>

Don’t get me wrong, social media comes in at a close second… but asking someone to blog is like pulling teeth!</p>
<p>I have blogged for the past few of years, both personally and professionally. Even now as a marketer, I still face challenges at finding topics to write about and finding the time to sit down and devote to writing. It’s incredibly challenging and you really do need self-discipline to keep the momentum going. However, once you find your groove, it’s easy to see why people love blogging. Not to mention, you’ll begin to notice and reap the benefits over time.</p>
<p>Here is just a short list of what I believe are some of the hidden benefits of blogging. Feel free to add to this list in the comments section.</p>
<p><b>Blogging helps you understand and learn about your business</b><br />
When you are challenged to write about topics that your customer would like to know, it forces you to put pen to paper (or finger to key) and really hone in on who your ideal customer is, what challenges they face, what their needs are, wants are, etc. You find new ways of explaining your business as you begin to communicate to specific key audiences. You also become better at communicating the answer to the age-old question, “What is it that you do?”</p>
<p><b>Blogging forces you to keep up on industry trends</b><br />
It’s hard to always find time to research what’s going on in your industry. When you are blogging and looking for inspiration on what to write about, it’s much easier to work this in organically. Not only does keeping up on industry trends keep you informed about what’s going on, it gets you thinking about ways you can integrate some of these trends in your own business plan.  It also allows you to communicate to your customer about what’s going on in your industry because you are in the know. And let’s face it, when you educate your customer, you look smart. Who doesn’t want to look smart?</p>
<p><b>Blogging can help you become a better salesperson</b><br />
<i>“Say what?</i>” Yes, blogging can really help you become a better salesperson. It’s much easier to write and try to sell an idea rather than just trying to come up with a sales pitch on the fly. Blogging helps you articulate what you want to say and how to say it. Bonus: you also begin to build a reserve bank of discussion points about your products or services when you write long enough. By repurposing your old content into something new, it saves you time, money and keeps things looking fresh.</p>
<p><b>Blogging can help your business grow</b><br />
Imagine what could happen if you brought in qualified sales leads from your company blog. No cold calling, no advertising and no spending thousands of dollars on marketing campaigns. Is that hard to imagine? Well, you really can bring in leads from your website. Not only does blogging help your search engine rankings organically, it gives your business credibility and shows that you are an expert. Search engines love that. When you write about topics that are interesting, informative and educational to your potential clients, you are already putting a sales pitch out on your website whether you know it or not. Leverage this and use it to your advantage.</p>
<p>And there you have it! Of course, there are many, many other hidden benefits to blogging. These are just a few that mean the most to many of our B2B clients. If you don’t have a company blog, have no fear. We can help you add a blog to your website so you can begin leveraging your blog as one of your inbound marketing tactics. Now get out there and start blogging!</p>

During my high school days, social media was the new thing. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and later down the line Pinterest, were all new and unique ways to share your information, interests, and opinions to the world. I remember when almost no businesses could be found on social media, it was just your friends and co-workers.</span></b></p>
<p>Things have definitely changed since then. Nowadays, almost every business’ first task besides opening their doors is to develop their presence on social media. However overtime, social media created a business divide. This division changed how business’ developed their strategy and their voice on social media. It was simply whether your company was a B2B (business to business) or a B2C (business to consumer).</p>
<p><b>This article will help erase the confusion between how these two types of businesses should operate on social media</b>. Keep in mind that these tactics and viewpoints below stem from observations and continuous practice. Since each business is different, each one will receive a different and unique outcome. Without further ado, I present to you the 3 Ways B2B and B2C Businesses Differ in Social Media.</p>
<p><b>1. Dominant Platforms</b></p>
<p><strong>B2B-</strong> LinkedIn is notably the most profitable and engaging tool for B2B companies. It has the ability to connect you easily through search and introduction to many other business owners locally, nationally and globally. It is a great networking and knowledge-sharing tool, and can present your business in the best light without having to protect it from spammers and web trolls commonly seen on Facebook and Twitter accounts. However besides LinkedIn, Twitter and Google Plus work quite well due to both their authoritative presence and easy ability to engage in conversation.</p>
<p><strong>B2C-</strong> Twitter, Facebook, and most definitely Pinterest are B2C’s best friends. They can easily connect you with your target market, allow for customer engagement, feedback, and support, and finally allow your business to quickly and freely promote offers and new products. Pinterest is the front-runner for B2C in 2013. It’s visual, addictive, and organized in a way where people can see what they like, but aren’t hassled to buy immediately. Facebook is great for the “storefront” point of view, and Twitter is the Internet conversation sensation.</p>
<p><b>2. Blogging and Digital Media</b></p>
<p><b>B2B- </b>Blogging is easily one of the most essential aspects of a B2B social media strategy. It allows for a business to share it’s services, industries, and opinions in a direct and eloquent way, without all the confusion, dictionary flipping, and glossy-eyed skimming. We all know that sometimes a B2B business can seem quite boring. However, a blog can add life, voice, and spirit to a company, making it much more approachable and lovable by the web community. Blogging also improves your search engine ranking. As you update your blog, Google recognizes that your website is providing more and more useful and practical content, thus pushes you to the top and your competitors down.</p>
<p><b>B2C-</b> In this type of business, blogging is a way to expand and stretch a company’s mission and image. B2C companies have the advantage to go viral. They can create those insane YouTube videos and advertisements that often make no sense, but get a great laugh­­––often without any harm to the company’s bottom line. In fact blogging, video, photo shoots, and other types of media can increase profits because it humanizes the company to the consumer­­. Thus, make your brand a best friend instead of just a shopping cart.</p>
<p><b>3. Peak Times</b></p>
<p><b>B2B-</b> Business hours. If you are a business striving after another, it is key to keep your social media game within that 7 A.M to 6 P.M., Monday through Friday range. Think of social media as your second shop, which stops when you do. LinkedIn is best for the early morning crowd, the go-getters, who are catching up on their favorite articles and group discussions. Twitter is a great slack-off, mid-afternoon platform when people are looking for something interesting to read or watch. Either way, know which platforms you are engaging on and test out which posting times work best for you––it’s all about trial and error.</p>
<p><b>B2C-</b> All the time. The great thing about these types of businesses is that peak times never really die. Facebook is great for the mornings and mid-afternoon. Twitter is an afternoon, all evening platform, and Pinterest thrives in the late-night hour, for those in the midst of insomnia.  Posting on the weekends is also a great idea because people have time off and often are on social media, constantly. It is also key to watch what’s trending and comment on it­­––live! Remember the Oreo Ad from the 2013 Superbowl––post blackout?</p>
<p>If not here is an article about it. This was easily one of the best social media success stories, and proves that if you have your resources ready and aren’t afraid to take a risk that it can really pay off.</p>
<p>Even though it seems as though the hay days of MySpace are over, and people are questioning Facebook’s future, it is easy to say that social media isn’t going anywhere.

Whether your business is a B2B or a B2C, the main takeaway from all of this is to just give it a go<b>. All companies in all shapes and sizes can benefit from social media.</b> Just be smart, be flexible, and never be afraid to take risks.</p>
