  <p><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154865/coby-fleener" class="sbn-auto-link">Coby Fleener</a> has missed practice time this week with a concussion that he supposedly suffered in Sunday's preseason loss to the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills" class="sbn-auto-link">Bills</a>, a game that saw Fleener fumble away a ball and drop another one in the end zone.  Last season, Fleener missed some time with a shoulder injury which caused him to play in 12 games, starting 10.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts" class="sbn-auto-link">Colts</a> absolutely need Coby Fleener healthy this year, and they absolutely need him to play well.  And that's why he appears on this list at number 12.</p>
<p>Coby Fleener is poised to have a breakout year this year.  Many people were disappointed with his rookie 2012 season, as his 26 receptions for 281 yards and 2 touchdowns were much lower than people were expecting and hoping for from the team's second round draft pick (34th overall) and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152649/andrew-luck" class="sbn-auto-link">Andrew Luck's</a> Stanford teammate.</p>
<p>First off, the expectations for his 2012 season may have been unrealistically high; secondly, his teammate <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154893/dwayne-allen" class="sbn-auto-link">Dwayne Allen</a> was absolutely tremendous, which overshadowed Fleener; thirdly, he did miss time with an injury; fourth, Bruce Arians' offense wasn't a great fit for Fleener; and fifth, he was just a rookie after all.  Need any more reasons?  Nope, didn't think so.</p>
<p>Basically, here's where Fleener is entering 2013: he's a bit overshadowed by Allen, but not so much to the degree that people aren't expecting things from him this year, he's in an offense that he is very familiar with and excelled in at Stanford, and he is in his second year in the league.  He's really poised to have a big year, as both <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/3/27/4150244/colts-tight-end-coby-fleener-could-be-poised-for-big-year">myself </a>and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/7/3/4416106/coby-fleener-in-ideal-position-to-flourish-in-2013-for-indianapolis">Tyler Brooke</a> have looked at this offseason.  Ryan Grigson agrees, <a target="_blank" href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/08/06/grigson-thinks-fleener-will-make-a-big-jump-in-2013/">telling Pro Football Talk's Scott Pioli </a>when asked about breakout candidates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; margin: 0em 0em 1.2em; padding: 0em; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4em; text-align: left;">"The first player that would come to mind would be [tight end] <a class="nameLink" href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/7418/coby-fleener" style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Coby Fleener</a>," G.M. Ryan Grigson sold Scott Pioli of <em>Pro Football Talk</em> on NBCSN.  "Knock on wood, he&rsquo;s a guy that you knew had speed, had size being six-six and running 4.51 [seconds in the 40-yard dash].  You know he could be a tough mismatch downfield because he could play above the rim."</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; margin: 0em 0em 1.2em; padding: 0em; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.4em; text-align: left;">Helping Fleener is the arrival of his offensive coordinator at Stanford, Pep Hamilton, who is now running the offense in Indy.</p>
<p><span>"He&rsquo;s doing the same things that made him that guy that we all said, &lsquo;Wow,&rsquo;" Grigson said.  "So I think just him having that comfort with Pep being here and being back in the system, it&rsquo;s really come across like he&rsquo;s ready to have a great year.  We expect that from him, top. He&rsquo;s got to get better as a blocker, he knows that.  We want him to be a threat downfield."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span></span>People who ask me for fantasy advice get two responses: 1) don't listen to me when it comes to fantasy football, and 2) Coby Fleener.  He's a breakout candidate for the Colts this year, and his impact in the passing game will be crucial for this team.  The Colts and Pep Hamilton plan to use Fleener in several different ways, not just at tight end but split out wide as a wideout too.</p>
<p>Fleener's impact in the passing game was evident in the Colts' first preseason game, as he had a 14-yard reception and then a 24-yard reception in limited time, catching 2 of Andrew Luck's 4 completions on Sunday.  The problem, of course, was that he fumbled the ball away at the end of that 24-yard catch and then shortly after dropped a would-be touchdown pass in the end zone from <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2306/matt-hasselbeck" class="sbn-auto-link">Matt Hasselbeck</a>.  That got fans concerned, and it turns out that Fleener suffered a concussion as well.  But the point I'm trying to make is that we saw how involved Fleener will be in that offense and we see that he does get open and put himself in the position to make plays.  Sure, he has work to do, and if he continues to work and improve then we will see him really breakout this season.</p>
<p>If he doesn't, we will see a major component of this Colts' offense taken away and we will not see the level of play from the unit that we expect to see.  Fleener is one of the most gifted pass catching tight ends in the NFL and has the speed and hands to make himself a very dangerous weapon.  Whether it be from the standard tight end position or as a receiver split out wide, Coby Fleener will see the field a lot this season and he will be a major factor in the Colts' offense.  That's why he's number 12 on this list, and that's why he needs to keep getting better.  Because he has the caliber to be a top-notch pass catching tight end, and the opportunity will be there this year for him to prove it.  As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/3/27/4150244/colts-tight-end-coby-fleener-could-be-poised-for-big-year">I wrote back in March</a> on Fleener:</p>

Adding Pep Hamilton should help Fleener perhaps more than anybody else, and as a result the second-year tight end could be staring at a big year. Between Fleener and Dwayne Allen, the Colts could have one of the best tight end duos in the NFL. And what better way for the offense to thrive than giving Andrew Luck two big, dangerous targets in Fleener and Allen?"</p>

  <p>"Ultimately we play to win all of our games... there's no excuse for us not to go out and try to score points every time we touch the football."</p>
<p>That was <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a>' offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton this morning, talking about his team's offense and whether they place more emphasis on winning in the preseason or on getting better. &nbsp;Hamilton talked about how the Colts are clearly a run first and power running team and that he thought that the Colts did a good job with the run and pass balance in the first half of this past Sunday's game.</p>
<p>Except for, when you look at the numbers, the Colts ran 28 pass plays and 11 run plays in the first half. &nbsp;That's 71.8% passes. &nbsp;Not exactly what I'd call balance (unless you're comparing it to the second half, where 22 of the 25 plays were pass plays - 88%).</p>
<p>There's also the possibility that the run emphasis is not on how much they run it as compared to when they run it, as my buddy Tom James keeps pointing out in the media trailer. &nbsp;I think he's absolutely right, but I got to thinking about when a power run game should come into play - in short yardage situations, right? &nbsp;So I looked at every Colts snap that was taken on Sunday with four yards or less to get a first down. &nbsp;There were 9 such instances, and every single time they went to the air. &nbsp;Every single time. &nbsp;There was even a tenth that was negated due to a penalty (the Colts picked up the first down anyway) and on that play, they still were passing it.</p>
<p>It was just one game, so I'm not saying that's how it's always going to be. &nbsp;They will be more balanced going forward, I guarantee you that. &nbsp;It's just that actions speak louder than words, and one game in, the Colts haven't exactly been balanced. &nbsp;That's coming, and even if it doesn't, I bet most people paying to see the Colts play wouldn't be upset at seeing Luck that much. &nbsp;But we both know that it can't happen again this year.</p>
<p>Pep also had a very interesting take on the common saying "limiting bad/negative plays." &nbsp;Pep said that their main goal is not to limit them but to manage them. &nbsp;He explained that, since there are many more bad plays than just turnovers, it's about not compounding on the problem and adjusting to it. &nbsp;The example he gave is that if they are going deep and their primary receiver is covered, they have to come back underneath and check it down, and sometimes they'll even have to throw it away. &nbsp;It's about managing bad plays and making sure that the Colts aren't adding to the problem. &nbsp;That's an interesting way to look at it and I like it.</p>
<p>Greg Manusky also talked today and said that he hopes to see his starters get around 15 snaps playing together on Sunday. &nbsp;He added that it depends on age too, as guys over 30 years old will likely play less than younger guys. &nbsp;Manusky said that he still wants to see his players "blow their lungs out" despite seeing the limited playing time and that he doesn't want them to get to the regular season opener and have guys breathing heavy for the first time.</p>
<p>He also talked about how <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155068/josh-chapman">Josh Chapman</a> played well against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills">Bills</a>' stretch-cut scheme on Sunday, the same scheme that the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a> run (although Manusky acknowledged that they run it better than the Bills do). &nbsp;He also talked about <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130987/drake-nevis">Drake Nevis</a> and how he is picking up where he left off before he got hurt last year and is improving every day.</p>
<p>Here are some notes from this afternoon's practice:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Yesterday I was very critical of <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71518/darrius-heyward-bey">Darrius Heyward-Bey</a> and his drops. &nbsp;He rebounded today with a nice practice, catching most of what was thrown his way (he still had a drop or two). &nbsp;He made two very great plays, the first where it was a real quick screen right to DHB who then turned his speed on and split two defenders on the way to the end zone. &nbsp;The second was on a slant into the end zone guarded by <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71148/vontae-davis">Vontae Davis</a>, and the possession battle caused us to joke about the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/seattle-seahawks">Seahawks</a>/<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/green-bay-packers">Packers</a> game last year. &nbsp;DHB and Davis kept fighting for it and went to the ground still wrestling for it. &nbsp;Neither one would give it up and soon several other teammates came over and were trying to help their guy come out with it. &nbsp;In the end, DHB held on for the touchdown and came out of the pile with it.</span></li>
<li><span>Another funny play came when they ran a reverse to <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154920/t-y-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a> and he took off running towards the end zone and just before he got there it was a close play as to whether he was down just shy of the end zone or whether <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130964/lawrence-guy">Lawrence Guy</a> got him down. &nbsp;Guy yelled, "You think I would have dove for you?" and Pagano came running over with a smile and ruled T.Y. down at the one, which prompted more reaction from the players. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2834/reggie-wayne">Reggie Wayne</a> made a sideline catch along the left sideline but the official ruled him out of bounds. &nbsp;Reggie obviously wasn't happy and was arguing with the official. &nbsp;Meanwhile, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/1497/cory-redding">Cory Redding</a> and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2808/robert-mathis">Robert Mathis</a>, standing a ways back behind the goal line, went crazy and were jumping around taunting Reggie. &nbsp;It was pretty funny. &nbsp;Right after that, however, Reggie came back with a catch&nbsp;across&nbsp;the middle, then pointed back towards either the official or Redding and Mathis (or both), taunting them back. &nbsp;That was the last time Reggie was practicing today so we joked that he got "ejected," but I really doubt it (and if he did, it was in a joking way). </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152649/andrew-luck">Andrew Luck</a> saw some time with some 2nd and 3rd team wideouts pretty extensively today. &nbsp;I think he had at least an entire drive with guys like DHB, T.Y. Hilton, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194751/lanear-sampson">Lanear Sampson</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155538/jabin-sambrano">Jabin Sambrano</a>. &nbsp;He hit the running backs and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154865/coby-fleener">Coby Fleener</a> some on that drive too. &nbsp;It was just interesting because Luck hasn't seen much time at all with Sampson or Sambrano. &nbsp;But he did have a really nice throw to Sambrano, who made a really nice catch, for a score. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194093/justice-cunningham">Justice Cunningham</a> had a nice touchdown where he batted the ball up twice and then caught it.</span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/204845/ashante-williams">Ashante Williams</a> had a pick off of <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2306/matt-hasselbeck">Matt Hasselbeck</a>, as did <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71172/darius-butler">Darius Butler</a>. &nbsp;<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155515/shawn-loiseau">Shawn Loiseau</a> picked Andrew Luck on a pass that was tipped. </span></li>
<li><span>Oh, and Lanear Sampson? &nbsp;Yeah, I think he continues to be the guy I'm least impressed with this camp. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2833/adam-vinatieri">Adam Vinatieri</a> missed three kicks wide left today, something very unusual for him. &nbsp;He obviously wasn't happy with it, as he went over to the side field and began kicking more after the drill was over.</span></li>
<li><span>Robert Mathis may have had the move of camp so far. &nbsp;In the pass rushing drill (personally my favorite drill), he was facing <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130994/anthony-castonzo">Anthony Castonzo</a> and spun outside off the snap, just like a lot of people do. &nbsp;Then, however, Mathis immediately spun back inside and easily blew right by Castonzo. &nbsp;It was an incredible move. &nbsp;I really can't do it justice here. &nbsp;After the play, Cory Redding celebrated by pouring a water bottle on Mathis' head.</span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/193325/bjoern-werner">Bjoern Werner</a> comes off the snap too low and as a result gets driven into the ground at times. &nbsp;It happened again today against <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/34413/gosder-cherilus">Gosder Cherilus</a>. &nbsp;A little bit later in practice, however, he redeemed himself with a pretty nice rush against Cherilus. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155196/chandler-harnish">Chandler Harnish</a> continues to look unimpressive. &nbsp;We had an&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;discussion amongst the media today about whether that is because he really has gotten worse since last year or whether brining in Hasselbeck makes the gap look that much bigger between 2 and 3. &nbsp;I think both are the case, but I'd have a really hard time saying that he is better now than last year (or even the same).</span></li>
<li><span>I haven't seen <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/192533/josh-mcnary">Josh McNary</a> even on the field in a few days. &nbsp;I didn't really look for him yesterday. &nbsp;Today I looked but couldn't find him. &nbsp;I don't really know what's going on there.</span></li>
<li><span>Coby Fleener was in full pads and participating fully in practice. &nbsp;He passed the tests to return to practice but has yet to pass the tests to be cleared to play. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/108532/pat-angerer">Pat Angerer</a> was in full pads today and did some work off to the side.</span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/16850/laron-landry">LaRon Landry</a> came out today with his left knee wrapped and with ice on it. &nbsp;I'm no doctor, but I don't think that's a sign he's ready to practice.</span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154893/dwayne-allen">Dwayne Allen</a> was without crutches today and walking fine, albeit with a boot still on his right foot.</span></li>
<li><span>Overall, today was the healthiest I've seen this Colts team. </span></li>
</ul>
<div>Today was by far the best day of practice this camp. &nbsp;The team was really fired up, really spirited, and really into it. &nbsp;It was really fun to watch, and most of these stories in here are told with a light-hearted feel and with a humorous tone. &nbsp;That's just the type of day it was, but that is all because of how intense and on fire they were today. &nbsp;They weren't taking practice lightly at all, but rather were getting so into it that it created a funny competition between the offense and defense. &nbsp;After yesterday's practice, today was a very welcome one and one that was fun to watch.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>And hey, they looked really good on the field too. &nbsp;That's always good as well.</div>

  <p>We here at Stampede Blue are well ahead of the curve when it comes to Fantasy Football. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/1/4578680/stampede-blue-and-yahoo-bring-you-fantasy-football-2013-sign-up-today">We asked for interested people two weeks ago</a>, got a huge response, and we have a total of <i><b>12 leagues</b></i> we'll be keeping track of this year, all done through Yahoo! Fantasy Football, our choice for FFL here at SB Nation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for anyone who didn't see the original post, all 12 leagues are completely full up, and three of them have already drafted, thanks to my work schedule being pretty busy leading up to opening night. Want some information on where players were drafted?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/19109/adrian-peterson">Adrian Peterson</a> went #1 overall in all 3 leagues. <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152686/doug-martin">Doug Martin</a> went 2nd in two of the leagues (one was to me), while <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71642/arian-foster">Arian Foster</a> went #2 overall in the other league. Martin fell to 5th.</li>
<li>
<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152649/andrew-luck">Andrew Luck</a> went 19th overall, 7th overall, and 55th overall. I'll be interested to see where he goes in all of our leagues.</li>
<li>Other <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> that have been drafted in all 3 drafts: <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2834/reggie-wayne">Reggie Wayne</a> (avg 38th overall), <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/16768/ahmad-bradshaw">Ahmad Bradshaw</a> (avg 59th overall), <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154920/t-y-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a> (avg 74th overall), <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154865/coby-fleener">Coby Fleener</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155100/vick-ballard">Vick Ballard</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154893/dwayne-allen">Dwayne Allen</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71518/darrius-heyward-bey">Darrius Heyward-Bey</a>, and Adam Vinatieri. Donald Brown was taken in one draft, and the Defense is available in all three leagues.</li>
<li>The third draft went deep into the RB field, drafting 59 in total (53 in the other two). Several times I yelled because a guy went at least a round earlier than I thought he would. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be continuing are drafting Thursday night, then pick it back up for our late-night and West-coasters next week. Thank you again to everyone who signed up and got back to me promptly with their choices and accepting draft invites. Usually it's like pulling teeth to fill the last spots, but actually had to turn some people away (sorry!) this year. I appreciate all of you not having to hound you to accept.</p>
<p>For those of you that want to play in another league, we'd obviously <a target="_blank" href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1">recommend using Yahoo to run it</a>. You can now draft on your phone or tablet as well (worked excellent last night on my Droid phone, something ESPN cannot do to my knowledge). Feel free to make your own league with other readers (you can chat in the comments here).</p>
<p>Good Luck drafting everyone!</p>

  <p><span>Well, the injury bug has taken a chomp out of one of the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts" class="sbn-auto-link">Colts</a> yet again, and this time, it&rsquo;s tight end <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154865/coby-fleener" class="sbn-auto-link">Coby Fleener</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>According to the various eyes and ears of training camp, Fleener has suffered from a concussion and will now go through the concussion protocol to be cleared.</span></p>
<p><span>Last week, the Colts were dealt with their first tight end-related injury scare when <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154893/dwayne-allen" class="sbn-auto-link">Dwayne Allen</a> went down with a banged up foot. Thankfully, Allen will be ready to go for the regular season opener, according to head coach Chuck Pagano.</span></p>
<p><span>However, for Fleener, it will require a wait-and-see approach.</span></p>
<p><span>As Colts fans brutally learned with <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71478/austin-collie" class="sbn-auto-link">Austin Collie</a>, concussions are not only nasty (and incredibly scary in Collie&rsquo;s case), but they have a rather unpredictable recovery time. Even if the player feels like they&rsquo;re ready to go, they still must meet and achieve the requirements of the protocol to fully return to action, and for good reason.</span></p>
<p><span>Back in 2010, two years before the NFL&rsquo;s widespread attempt to crackdown on concussions, Collie was cleared to return in a game against the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/new-england-patriots" class="sbn-auto-link">Patriots</a>, and did so, only to suffer what was believed to be his second unconfirmed concussion of the year.</span></p>
<p>Collie would later suffer yet <i>another </i>concussion, putting his career in jeopardy.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be the concussion bogeyman, but needless to say, concussions are absolutely nothing to mess with. Fleener could be ready to go in a week, and we all hope that's the case, but it should be obvious that coach Pagano and crew will err on the side of caution, especially with Allen already recovering from injury.</p>
<p><span>For Fleener, the concussion diagnosis comes after a preseason effort against the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills" class="sbn-auto-link">Buffalo Bills</a> that was fairly unspectacular.</span></p>
<p><span>Fleener had a costly fumble on his second drive with the first team and an end zone drop/strip during the third drive that would&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2306/matt-hasselbeck" class="sbn-auto-link">Matt Hasselbeck</a>&rsquo;s first touchdown.</span></p>
<div><span>There's good news, though: If the Colts' tight ends keep being injured at this rate, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/109214/brody-eldridge" class="sbn-auto-link">Brody Eldridge</a> can make a surprise return to the horseshoe.</span></div>

  <p>A lot of this morning's information (including roster moves, injury updates, and reaction to Jim Irsay's tweet yesterday) was included in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/13/4617936/colts-am-update-roster-moves-injury-update-and-irsay-tweet-reaction">this morning's update</a>, but we've still got some stuff we'll include in the intro to today's notes. &nbsp;It was an interesting day at Anderson University to say the least, as we were very interested to see how the team responded to their ugly loss on Sunday.</p>
<p>The answer? &nbsp;Business as usual.</p>
<p>My reaction? &nbsp;No surprise whatsoever.</p>
<p>There wasn't any hiding the fact that the team stunk on Sunday, with Luck saying that "we definitely could have performed better" and that they need to get better, and the way to do that is to practice. &nbsp;He said that they should improve and that will come with being faster and more confident.</p>
<p>Chuck Pagano's emphasis today was that the team was "disappointed but not discouraged" by Sunday's loss and said that he absolutely expects a bounce back performance this Sunday against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/new-york-giants">Giants</a>, as does everybody else on the team. &nbsp;Pagano said that "top to bottom we were all disappointed" and that "we expect to go out and perform." &nbsp;He stressed the fact that "there is no need to panic" and said that they will keep improving on the good things and identify the flaws and work on them. &nbsp;He told the players to talk with their position coach and get a plan on how to improved individually, and then to do that.</p>
<p>The team should look much better on Sunday, like Pagano expects, simply because the starters will play longer. &nbsp;Pagano said today that "our starters will play more this week. &nbsp;He also stated that the starters have to play more this week to continue to work on playing together and continue to get better. &nbsp;The more that they play, the more that we will see the points of emphasis.</p>
<p>Three guys in particular that Pagano raved about were <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155322/delano-howell">Delano Howell</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/196225/allen-chapman">Allen Chapman</a>, and wide receiver T.Y. Hilton. &nbsp;He was asked about Howell, as the safety played 89 snaps on Sunday, and Pagano said with a smile that "he's in excellent shape. &nbsp;Marathon man." &nbsp;He added that Howell took full advantage of an opportunity when he had it and that "he made a statement." &nbsp;He said that it was a great start towards Howell making himself necessary.</p>
<p>Pagano wasn't asked about Allen Chapman but threw his name out there anyway as a guy that really impressed on Sunday and the coach said he stood out as well, also taking full advantage of an opportunity.</p>
<p>Someone asked about <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154920/t-y-hilton">T.Y. Hilton's</a> tendency to make big plays and whether Pagano expects it from him and he answered that "everybody does." &nbsp;He said that with the way that Hilton prepares, "it's no surprise to us."</p>
<p>So yeah, other than the fact that today was the first day back after an ugly loss, the team had to deal with their owner tweeting something ill-advised, two players being signed and two others being waived-injured, and two guys coming off of the PUP, there's not much to report.</p>
<p>Because, after all, it's business as usual here in Anderson, Indiana.</p>
<p>Here are some notes and observations from this afternoon's practice:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Even though it was business as usual in regards to how practice was run, it was not business as usual when it came to the actual play on the field. &nbsp;Well, at least let's hope not. &nbsp;There were A TON of drops today. &nbsp;Here are just the ones that I wrote down, which I don't think was all of them: <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/131021/delone-carter">Delone Carter</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/187987/jeremy-kelley">Jeremy Kelley</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194751/lanear-sampson">Lanear Sampson</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155538/jabin-sambrano">Jabin Sambrano</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194093/justice-cunningham">Justice Cunningham</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71518/darrius-heyward-bey">Darrius Heyward-Bey</a> (4), <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2834/reggie-wayne">Reggie Wayne</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/156712/dominique-jones">Dominique Jones</a>. &nbsp;I kid you not. &nbsp;And those are just the ones that I wrote down. &nbsp;It was bad. &nbsp;Really, really, really, really, really bad. &nbsp;So bad that even after practice when some receivers were just running routes and the quarterbacks getting a little extra throwing in, we saw a few drops too. &nbsp;Wow.</span></li>
<li><span>Speaking of DHB, I think it might actually stand for "Doesn't Hang-onto Balls." &nbsp; Geez, he was terrible today. &nbsp;On one, he heard&nbsp;footsteps&nbsp;- but they're in freaking shells. &nbsp;He's not going to get hit! &nbsp;On another, Luck threw a really nice comeback route that hit him in the hands. &nbsp;And perhaps the worst one of the day and the last one of the day, Luck aired it out deep downfield to DHB, running into the end zone. &nbsp;He comes back, getting in front of 3 guys getting ready to catch the hail mary touchdown... and it went right through his hands. &nbsp;Ugh. </span></li>
<li><span>Since we're on the topic of drops, how about a guy who really impressed me with his hands today - <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/16768/ahmad-bradshaw">Ahmad Bradshaw</a>. &nbsp;At this morning's walkthrough he was working at the jugs machine and was catching everything, just walking continually towards the machine. &nbsp;At the end, he was literally about 2-3 yards away it looked like and still was catching it all. &nbsp;Very impressive.</span></li>
<li><span>Other than drops, which ruled the day, there actually was other stuff going on today as well, believe it or not. &nbsp;One of them was that <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/199745/daniel-adongo">Daniel Adongo</a> was participating in practice for the first time this camp. &nbsp;He came out, got help adjusting his helmet, got help with his gloves, and then was on the punt rush scout team. &nbsp;He did very well at running right into a blocker. &nbsp;Hey, it's a start, right?</span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2306/matt-hasselbeck">Matt Hasselbeck</a> had a really good day of practice today. &nbsp;He made some really nice throws in individual drills and then led his second team offense to two straight touchdown drives against the first team defense, just picking them apart. &nbsp;The play of the day came via a Hasselbeck throw to T.Y. Hilton on a throw that was absolutely perfect. &nbsp;He threw it to T.Y. on a wheel route deep along the left sideline and it was a beauty. &nbsp;It beat <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71148/vontae-davis">Vontae Davis</a> and Delano Howell and just dropped perfectly into Hilton's hands. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155540/griff-whalen">Griff Whalen</a>, who has a groin injury, was holding for a <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194747/brandon-mcmanus">Brandon McManus</a> kick today. &nbsp;Now I'm not sure, but I wouldn't think that's good on an injured groin. &nbsp;Just me. &nbsp;But hey, what can't the Griffer do?</span></li>
<li><span>The best drill in camp seems to be the pass rush drill, where a defensive lineman goes up against an offensive lineman. &nbsp;Here are some observations from that today: <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2808/robert-mathis">Robert Mathis</a> blew right by <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130994/anthony-castonzo">Anthony Castonzo</a>. &nbsp;Anthony Castonzo did really well against <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/193325/bjoern-werner">Bjoern Werner</a>. &nbsp;<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/196759/caesar-rayford">Caesar Rayford</a> may be too tall to be an effective rusher - his stance is awkward and he's just so stiff coming up. &nbsp;<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130935/ben-ijalana">Ben Ijalana</a> handled him pretty well today. </span></li>
<li><span>Bjoern Werner, honestly, hasn't done a whole lot to impress me this camp. &nbsp;He just hasn't shown me a lot in terms of pass rush. &nbsp;I know he's still learning, so I'm not sounding the alarm bell yet by any means, but he hasn't had the best camp. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154865/coby-fleener">Coby Fleener</a> missed practice today with a concussion. &nbsp;The &nbsp;team is going through the protocol with him. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154893/dwayne-allen">Dwayne Allen</a> was spotted today! &nbsp;He has a boot on his right foot and is on crutches. &nbsp;The thing is, multiple times it looked like he started to walk, remembered the crutches, and then began using them. &nbsp;I still don't know what to make of his injury and still don't know whether to expect him back week one, but we did see him today. </span></li>
<li><span>Because of the injuries to Fleener and Allen, Justice Cunningham and Dominique Jones saw some really good playing time today at tight end. &nbsp;Hopefully that will really help both of them.</span></li>
</ul>
<div>The <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> return to the practice field tomorrow with a closed walkthrough at 9:30 and an open practice at 1:50. &nbsp;We'll see if the Colts seem to have found some hands by then. &nbsp;But until then, I'll try not to drop my computer on the way out of the media trailer.</div>

  <p>We begin our series of the 13 most important players to the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a>' success this season by looking at defensive end <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/1497/cory-redding">Cory Redding</a>. &nbsp;Here's what I wrote of Redding in my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/7/5/4495880/2013-colts-positional-preview-the-defensive-line" target="_blank">positional preview of the defensive line</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 1em; font-family: 'Mercury SSm A', 'Mercury SSm B', Georgia, serif; line-height: 24px; color: #292929; font-size: 16px;" class="MsoNormal">Cory Redding brings the veteran presence to this position, as he is entering his 11th year in the league. He was drafted by the&nbsp;<a style="-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1em; display: inline-block; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: #777777;" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/detroit-lions" class="sbn-auto-link">Lions</a> in 2003 and spent 6 seasons there before being traded to the&nbsp;<a style="-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1em; display: inline-block; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: #777777;" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/seattle-seahawks" class="sbn-auto-link">Seahawks</a>prior to the 2009 season. After that, he signed with the&nbsp;<a style="-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1em; display: inline-block; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: #777777;" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/baltimore-ravens" class="sbn-auto-link">Baltimore Ravens</a> and played 2 seasons there and then he followed Chuck Pagano to Indianapolis last offseason. He has started 115 career games (playing in 145) and has made 342 tackles, 27.5 sacks, 1 safety, 16 pass deflections, 1 interception, forced 4 fumbles and recovered 10. For the Colts in 2012 he started 14 games and recorded 36 tackles, 2 sacks, 4 pass deflections and recovered a fumble.</p>
<p><span>I'll go out on a limb and say that Cory Redding retains his starting spot this year. He is clearly the best player at defensive end for the Colts, the best pass rusher, a team-leader and veteran presence, and someone very familiar with Chuck Pagano.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span></span>Yeah, that was sarcasm there, if you didn't catch that. &nbsp;Redding is absolutely going to be starting this season, and he's really the only one that I see definitely starting the whole season if healthy. &nbsp;Last year, the Colts' defense was noticeably better with Redding in the game than they were with him out of the game, and I would absolutely expect that to continue this year. &nbsp;Redding, speaking to the media last week, explained the role of the defensive linemen in the 3-4 defense, and it was perhaps the best I've heard someone explain it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>"We, up front, the main emphasis is to absorb people. You don&rsquo;t really want to have a 260 or 270 guy down on the front line that&rsquo;s going to get ate up. You want big 300-pound guys demanding two so you keep the linebackers free. You want them to make the plays. If you come off, and beat your guy and you make tackle, yes that&rsquo;s a plus. Great for you, but that really wasn&rsquo;t your play to make. That&rsquo;s the linebacker&rsquo;s play. We have to eat up two guys if we can every single play to keep our linebackers free. If you so happen to get off and make a play, that&rsquo;s excellent. That&rsquo;s pretty much what it&rsquo;s all about."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span></span>Undoubtedly, the defensive line is a huge part of the 3-4 defense. &nbsp;And the most important player on that defensive line this year will be Cory Redding. &nbsp;I know a lot of people probably would like me to say that <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155068/josh-chapman">Josh Chapman</a> is the most important player on the defensive line, but it's not even a sure bet that he'll be starting at the beginning of the season. &nbsp;I have to imagine he will be by the end of the year, but either way Redding should be there each and every game and will play a big role.</p>
<p>Not only does he bring a lot to the field, he also brings a lot of leadership to this defensive squad. &nbsp;Redding said that the mindset of a defender is that "you don't want to give the offense a blade of grass." &nbsp;That's the mentality that he is helping to instill in this defense, and not only does Redding say that but he sets an example of it as well. &nbsp;He fights in the trenches and helps to anchor that defensive line. &nbsp;When the team is in a 3-4 look, he's in there. &nbsp;When the team is in a 4-3 look, he's in there. &nbsp;And each and every play he is in the game, he's fighting to prevent the offense from getting a blade of grass.</p>
<p>Last year he finished with 36 tackles and 2 sacks in 14 games played (starting every one of them), and while his stats may not be overwhelming, for a defensive lineman in this system they're good and his impact goes way beyond that. &nbsp;Their goal, after all, is to take the offensive line on the play so that the linebackers can take the other guys. &nbsp;That's Redding's job every play - doing the work in the trenches. &nbsp;And added to that, he makes quite a few plays himself too.</p>
<p>If the Colts are going to succeed in 2013 on defense and really achieve the results that they want - stopping the run on their way to building a monster - Cory Redding will be right in the midst of it and will be playing a big role in accomplishing those goals. &nbsp;And for that reason, Cory Redding appears on our list at number 13 of the players most important to the Colts' success in 2013.</p>

  <p>The <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> reported back to Anderson University for training camp today for the first time since their 44-20 loss to the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills">Buffalo Bills</a> on Sunday. &nbsp;With it came quite a bit of information, whether it be roster moves, injury updates, or reaction to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/12/4616326/jim-irsays-critical-tweet-totally-uncalled-for" target="_blank">Jim Irsay's tweet yesterday</a>.</p>
<h3>Roster Moves:</h3>
<p>First off, the Colts announced roster moves this morning. &nbsp;The team officially announced the re-signing of linebacker <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/133524/monte-simmons">Monte Simmons</a> and also announced the signing of cornerback <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/194691/johnny-adams">Johnny Adams</a>. &nbsp;To make room for them, the team waived-injured linebackers <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/16849/justin-hickman">Justin Hickman</a> and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/133372/quinton-spears">Quinton Spears</a>. &nbsp;If they clear waivers, they will revert to the team's injured reserve.</p>
<p>Simmons was released back on August 5 to make room for fullback <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/132972/robert-hughes">Robert Hughes</a>, and now he's back. &nbsp;It's the second time so far that the team has released a linebacker during camp only to bring them back (the other being <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/196457/c-o-prime">C.O. Prime</a>, who was re-signed less than a day after being cut). &nbsp;The move&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/12/4615898/colts-move-rb-ahmad-bradshaw-to-active-roster-re-sign-lb-monte-simmons" target="_blank">was reported yesterday</a> and is now official.</p>
<p>Johnny Adams was originally signed by the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/houston-texans">Texans</a> as an undrafted free agent earlier this offseason before being released August 2nd. &nbsp;He started 39 of 54 career games at Michigan State and as a senior in 2012 he was named First Team All Big-Ten by the coaches.</p>
<p>Also news yesterday was that the Colts had activated <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/16768/ahmad-bradshaw">Ahmad Bradshaw</a> from the physically unable to play list, although the news also came out that the move was kind of forced by the NFL after the team violated the PUP rules. &nbsp;Head coach Chuck Pagano said this morning that "we felt like he was going to be off regardless." &nbsp;Bradshaw said that he does not anticipate playing on Sunday but is hoping to get in during the 3rd preseason game to get some work in. &nbsp;Bradshaw said that "we just want to take it slow and make it last all season."</p>
<p>Linebacker <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/108532/pat-angerer">Pat Angerer</a> was also activated from the PUP just this morning, but like Bradshaw the team is going to bring him along slowly. &nbsp;Still, that is good news as well. &nbsp;And for those wondering, both Bradshaw and Angerer already counted against the 90 man roster since they were on the PUP, so therefore there doesn't need to be a move made to make room for them.</p>
<h3>Injury Update:</h3>
<p>There's not much on the injury front to report this morning, other than Bradshaw and Angerer being activated. &nbsp;Pagano said that <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/109540/cassius-vaughn">Cassius Vaughn</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/193713/montori-hughes">Montori Hughes</a>, and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/16850/laron-landry">LaRon Landry</a> are all day to day and that <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/193325/bjoern-werner">Bjoern Werner</a> should practice this afternoon. &nbsp;Interestingly enough, Pagano didn't even mention <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/155540/griff-whalen">Griff Whalen</a> during his introductory injury update.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Pagano was asked why Whalen was not participating in this morning's walkthrough and instead was there with a backpack on that Pagano said that Whalen came out of the game on Sunday with a slight groin injury and that he may miss a day or two. &nbsp;Whalen is also day to day.</p>
<h3>Reaction to Jim Irsay's Tweet Yesterday:</h3>
<p>During this morning's walkthrough, much of the discussion amongst the media members here at camp was at least in some way relating to Jim Irsay's tweet from yesterday <i>(if you don't know what we're talking about, we've got the info&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/12/4614726/jim-irsay-sounds-upset-apologizes-for-colts-preseason-opener" target="_blank">here</a>, one opinion&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/12/4616326/jim-irsays-critical-tweet-totally-uncalled-for" target="_blank">here</a>, and another opinion&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2013/8/13/4616420/what-irsay-probably-meant-by-his-my-commanders-got-n-earful-from-me" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;Yeah, when the owner tweets, we respond!). </i></p>
<p>Chuck Pagano, of course, was asked about what his owner tweeted and he said that "top to bottom we were all disappointed" and that "we expect to go out and perform." &nbsp;He also added that "there's no need to panic" and that "everyone is accountable." &nbsp;Earlier in the press conference he had stated that "I fully expect this team to bounce back from Sunday's performance" and the message of the day seemed to be that the team is "disappointed but not discouraged." &nbsp;Pagano as asked specifically if he talked to Jim Irsay yesterday and he answered "no."</p>
<p>Quarterback <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152649/andrew-luck">Andrew Luck</a> was also asked about his owner's tweet and said that he wasn't really aware of it until someone told him this morning at camp. &nbsp;"You couldn't ask for a better owner," Luck said. &nbsp;"His heart is in this team one hundred percent and his players really appreciate it." &nbsp;He added that the players and coaches really don't want to disappoint him or any of the fans for that matter.</p>
