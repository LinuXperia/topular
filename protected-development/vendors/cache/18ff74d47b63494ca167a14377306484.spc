They have a darkness tempered by bright colors, a masculinity softened by female influence, and a calmness underneath their sometimes feverish, driving hooks. Their most recent release, entitled <em>The Sticks</em>, is full of seemingly conflicting elements. “Dread in my Heart” pairs a bouncy nursery rhyme melody with an acerbic despairing humor, and a poetic string of love metaphors ends with “Believe me when I say / Love, it dissipates” on the aptly-named “Love It Dissipates.”</p>
<p>Away from the stage, it makes sense. I chatted with singer Ryan Guldemond and drummer Ali Siadat before their recent show at Reggie&#8217;s Rock Club in Chicago, and they were a paradoxical pairing themselves. Siadat has an air of peace and benevolence surrounding him, while Guldemond&#8217;s wit drove the conversation, bouncing from shanties to American spittle.</p>
<p>Ali Siadat: It&#8217;s a good day.</p>
<p><em>It </em>is<em> a good day. Actually one of the last days of your tour, right?</em></p>
<p>Ryan Guldemond: Yeah, nothing for a couple weeks. Summers tend to be fairly intermittent, with festivals and things. Nothing really makes sense, you sort of patch it together.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12030" title="Mother Mother Interview - Lost In Concert _MG_0173" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mother-Mother-Interview-Lost-In-Concert-_MG_0173.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="390" /></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s been 2 years since you&#8217;ve been in Chicago. What do you miss most?</em></p>
<p>Ali: We always rush in, set up and play and leave. That&#8217;s unfortunate, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s the best city. When we do get five minutes to drive through and look at things, our eyes are peeled wide open to the spectacular colors and buildings and everything. That drive by the water is quite incredible.</p>
<p>Ryan: The rooftop patio on top here at Reggie&#8217;s is very cunning. I think we&#8217;ll miss it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12031" title="Mother Mother Interview - Lost In Concert _MG_0182" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mother-Mother-Interview-Lost-In-Concert-_MG_0182.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p><em>I read that your latest album was written mostly on the road. What makes the road such a good place to write music?</em></p>
<p>Ryan: You actually just get a lot of time to wait for stuff to happen, a lot of idle time to get stuff done. You log a lot of hours in the green room waiting for the action. It&#8217;s a great time to sit with an acoustic guitar and write and share it with the band, get intimate with the stuff. At home, everyone&#8217;s a bit more fragmented. Life seems to be a bit more scattered and all-consuming.</p>
<p><em>And everyone has their own houses&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Ryan: Shanties, more like. What about you, Ali?</p>
<p>Ali: One of the unsung categories is that when we&#8217;re all on the road, we&#8217;re all in each others face so much that we do get to experience a lot of music together. You hear stuff playing in the bus, you&#8217;ll see other bands playing. I think that just experiencing a lot of that together and talking about it and processing that internally, it all influences the creative process. We often find a lot of stuff that we really like on tour, and it funnels its way into our sound.</p>

<p><em>How do you go about fleshing out songs on the road? Or does that happen later?</em></p>
<p>Ryan: There&#8217;s only so much you can do on the road. You can&#8217;t all get into a studio and flesh it out, as it were. But at home, we undergo a demoing process using our home studios, recording ideas individually and collectively. Then we hash that out at a jam space.</p>
<p>There are a few stages. We gotta work out harmonies; that&#8217;s kind of its own process. Working out the rhythm section and guitar is its own thing, and putting it all together is the final act. There&#8217;s a few different categories of bringing a song to life.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12025" title="Mother Mother Interview - Lost In Concert _MG_0150" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mother-Mother-Interview-Lost-In-Concert-_MG_0150.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="390" /></p>
<p><em>You guys have been away from Canada for a while on this US tour. What&#8217;s the difference between playing and touring in the US and Canada?</em></p>
<p>Ali: More driving in Canada. Fewer centers of population, I think. The US tends to be a bit easier on a logistical front because the cities are closer together. You got NY, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, all of these major cities that are closer together, so you can have a bit of an easier time.</p>
<p>Ryan: Americans are crazier.</p>
<p><em>In what way?</em></p>
<p><em></em>Ryan: More raw, more loud, more vocal. There&#8217;s more spittle in the conversation, if you know what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p><em>Hah, I do know what you mean. I spit on plenty of folks.</em></p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12029" title="Mother Mother Interview - Lost In Concert _MG_0168" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mother-Mother-Interview-Lost-In-Concert-_MG_0168.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="390" /></em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also less attendees. We&#8217;re more of a bigger deal in Canada. Down here, we feel like were on a secret hidden mission, whereas up there, it all feels a bit more exposed.</p>
<p><em>Secret hidden mission! Excellent. So I love the new album, </em>The Sticks<em>, especially the lyrics. Is the disparity between lyrics and music, with dark lyrics over lighthearted music, on purpose or does it just happen that way?</em></p>
<p>Ryan: I think it must come from the brand of humor which the lyrics are borne out of. It&#8217;s a cynicism that wears a smile. I think for the dark subject matter to be presented well, it needs to come from a fairly neutral, almost comical standpoint. I think when the narrator and the message are all wallowing, it&#8217;s just too much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly subconscious, whatever it is. It&#8217;s not very purposeful. It kind of comes out how it comes out. But in having to think about these things and break them down, because we do interviews and stuff like that, people ask me about it.</p>
<p><em>It makes you analyze yourself.</em></p>
<p>Ryan: Yeah, which is a good process, because otherwise we&#8217;d never think about it. I think that has a lot to do with it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12024" title="Mother Mother Interview - Lost In Concert _MG_0147" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mother-Mother-Interview-Lost-In-Concert-_MG_0147.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="390" /></p>
<p><em>How do you reconcile the message/theme of </em>The Sticks<em>, the whole getting away from civilization and into the wild, with being in a band and having to be in cities.</em></p>
<p>Ryan: Well, it&#8217;s very easy to simplify yourself anywhere you are, whether it&#8217;s in the midst of a chaotic city or in a remote place. It&#8217;s less to do about your surroundings and more about your perceptions. <em>The Sticks</em> isn&#8217;t so much about moving into a cabin, it&#8217;s about breaking your perception down into some of the more raw, simpler, human roots.</p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s really the part that I identified most with, that simplification. People are living very complex lives.</em></p>
<p>Ryan: They&#8217;re living very complex lives, but it&#8217;s also very surface. It&#8217;s not complex in a good way, it&#8217;s complex in a simple and surface way. I think the more you strip and shed yourself of all these external things that distract us, the more complex you can be. Complex with your emotions and your soul and how you can use those tools to interact with the world at large in your craft, in your job and in your relationships. [To Ali] That&#8217;s a question you&#8217;d be in tune with. That manner of existing&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12028" title="Mother Mother Interview - Lost In Concert _MG_0161" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Mother-Mother-Interview-Lost-In-Concert-_MG_0161.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>Ali: Anything I would say would be a paraphrasing of what you said. I guess I would add that it is very easy to fall in line. Even if you have those intentions to simplify your life and move to some purer realm of existence, it&#8217;s so easy to fall in line with everybody around you when they are confused or scattered or angry or actively over-emotional. It&#8217;s very easy to fall in line with them, and it takes a special effort to step away. It takes a really strong intention to divorce yourself from that energy and to live differently when everybody else around you is doing that. I think <em>The Sticks</em> addresses that in a very direct fashion.</p>
<p>Ryan: Yeah, I&#8217;m not big for cryptic art. I like the message to be clear.</p>
<p><em>But it&#8217;s clear in a poetic way. Especially on “Love it Dissipates,” that last line surprised the hell out of me. But then you look back at some of the earlier lines, like “If you&#8217;re the wounded, I&#8217;ll be your pain&#8230;” There&#8217;s a little foreshadowing.</em></p>
<p>Ryan: There are some people who think that think that song is a long-winded and trite metaphor. I think it&#8217;s great to hear those kinds of things &#8217;cause it reminds you that people don&#8217;t listen too deeply to the lyrics&#8230; Which may be unfortunate on one hand, but on they other, it&#8217;s really exciting to put a lot of energy into your lyrics. Those that actually do take the time and dig in and get it are gonna have a much bigger reward &#8217;cause they&#8217;re privy to a secret handshake of sorts.</p>

It was a collective fervor not immediately apparent by any obvious cues like thrown panties, but an almost tangible feeling of being a part of something very cool. Some bands make you feel like you&#8217;re a part of some super-secret special club.</p>
<p>This hip new Mother Mother club is very exclusive, and the benefits are many.</p>
<p>The main benefit of this club meeting was an hour and a half set of songs that were even better than the album versions. Mother Mother&#8217;s albums are great, especially their newest effort, 2012&#8242;s The Sticks, but the songs take on a whole new life when played live. The bombastic, rapid-fire chorus “Bit by Bit” hit much harder, and the lighthearted cheerleader-esque shouts in “Infinitesimal” carried much more weight than on the record. Even the simple, stripped down “Dread in my Heart” was a more joyous affair than usual, but how could it not when the whole audience is smiling and singing “There&#8217;s a little shitty Devil in my brain.” Oh, and it turns out that “Dread in my Heart” is about lead singer Ryan Guldemond&#8217;s uncertain feeling about outliving the Forever 27 club. Take that <a href="http://Songmeanings.com/" target="_blank">Songmeanings.com</a>, we got it straight from the horses mouth!</p>
<p>With such vocally-driven material, there were a surprising number of instrumental breaks, and Guldemond was able to show off some excellent guitar flourishes. Drummer Ali Siadat and bassist Jeremy Page have to play simply to serve the pop tunes most of the time, but they got to stretch out a bit as well when the vocals took a break. Sometimes these breaks were longer jams in the middle of a song and some more ethereal jaunts served as smooth transitions between songs. “Infinitesimal” melded into an energetic “Baby Don&#8217;t Dance” and a caustic “Let&#8217;s Fall in Love” found itself suddenly being the ominous first notes of “Oh My Heart.”</p>
<p>Mother Mother also snuck in two Pixies covers (“Gouge Away” and “No. 13 Baby”) and a Nirvana cover (“In Bloom”), making some of their influences apparent if they weren&#8217;t already, but the covers honestly did not stand up to their original material. They played them well, but their originals have such a distinct personality that the covers almost took away from it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that personality that really helps made Reggie&#8217;s feel like a secret cool kid club. Guldemond&#8217;s smiling cynicism is infused in the songs of Mother Mother, and it&#8217;s a unique breath of fresh air to hear such honest and straightforward lyrical sentiments portrayed so thoughtfully. It is clear the band feels the same way about the audience, as well. I think Guldemond said it best with one of his closing remarks of the evening: “Thank you for coming to our secret party.”</p>
<p>And thanks for having us.</p>

The usual melancholy that comes along with overcast skies didn’t seem to be affecting the gathering crowd, maybe because everyone was high from smoking during Cypress Hill’s set, and definitely because everyone was high from smoking in preparation for 311’s impending set. Weed jokes aside, it is impossible to be in a bad mood when you are about to see 311 live, and that’s sort of the point.</p>
<p>They may get pretty heavy and aggressive sometimes, but 311 is all about having a good time with your fellow humans, and that message came through pretty heavily throughout their hit-laden set. I mean, come on, it’s called the UNITY Tour for a reason. No, it didn’t get as love-each-other-with-flowers-everywhere as the more festie festivals, but it was about as positive an atmosphere as you can get with that many flat brim hats. And they even got a little jammy with it sometimes, with guitarist Tim Mahoney having a couple longer solos and a sit-down solo bass jam from infamous bassist P-Nut.</p>
<p>Musically, 311 live is exactly what anyone who knows anything about 311 would expect. It’s really fucking awesome. They sound pretty much exactly like their records and have the great stage presence one would expect from a band that has been doing this as long as they have. Martinez’s voice was as excellent as his shirt was sweaty (from all the constant bouncing and robot dancing, you see), and Nick Hexum’s pipes were solid too. I was worried about Nick based on some past experiences, but besides a couple errant notes early in the set, he was doing it right.</p>
<p>311 play very well to their audience. All us Chicagoans are still high on the Blackhawks winning the Stanley Cup, so they made sure to make the right pandering gestures, like P-Nut wearing a Hawks jersey for a couple songs and dedicating a song to the hometown heroes. I don’t remember what song it was, but they also changed the words to insert “Chicago” in there, and we all sure ate that shit up. It tasted delicious.</p>
<p>Another tasty treat was the group drum jam. My only problem is that they’ve been doing this group drum jam for years, and now every indie band at every festival now inserts a jungle drumming session into their set. It’s losing it’s novelty, so while they execute it very well, it’s like, “Their all drumming now. That’s cool,” and not “Holy balls dude! They just rolled out a standing drum setup!” But 311 at least deserves credit for being one of the first to make it a “thing.” But everybody expects it now, so if they didn’t jungle it up, they’d probably have a lot of disappointed people.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, there weren&#8217;t many unsatisfied customers. Besides them not playing “Beyond The Gray Sky,” I was certainly sated. Both the perfect summer anthem sing-a-long of “Sunset In July” and the MONSTROUS rendition of “Creatures For A While” to close out the show were undeniably badass. The beautiful harmonies on “Amber” gave me chills. And the audience was really employing the whole “good time with your fellow humans” thing which really pushed me up and over into that 311 mindset.</p>
<p>That positive mindset is so important to understanding and enjoying 311, and they make it so easy to get it. You look at them up on stage and they&#8217;re just so obviously having a great time. It looks like they&#8217;re not even really trying to perform. Of course they are trying, but it just looks so natural, like this is just how they party.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like they just happen to enjoy playing songs they love, and we just happen to enjoy seeing them play songs we love. It&#8217;s a good arrangement.</p>

The beloved Blackhawks had a chance to win the Stanley Cup, and this meant that everybody and their grandparents had their eyes glued to the TV and their hand glued to a beer. I, however, was happily at the Subterranean (read: no TVs) and I had my eyes glued to something much different.</p>
<p>This one guy was dancing like a crazy person to Genome, the openers for Moon Hooch. Why is he getting down so hard? This is some good stuff, but you gotta have a lot of self-confidence to move like that when everyone else is just bobbing their heads.</p>
<p>It all made sense once Moon Hooch got on the stage. That dancing dude? He’s Moon Hooch’s  tenor sax/contrabass clarinet player, Wenzl McGowen, and that&#8217;s just how they roll. You have to be at least a little bit nuts to start a band with 2 saxophones and a drummer, and it works for &#8216;em. From the first note to the last, this supposed novelty power trio was nothing short of INTENSE.</p>
<p>On the self-released The Moon Hooch Album, their self-proclaimed “cave music” is raw and primitive, without much creative producing or use of rack effects, but Moon Hooch live is a whole different animal. Ok, it&#8217;s the same animal, but with some really cool extra stripes and mega-fangs or something. Like sticking a huge traffic cone in the bell of a saxophone to drop the pitch to the sub-basement or bringing their own sound-and-effects guy. The effects guy was basically the fourth member of the band, adding effects to the pulsing saxes and drums at the just the right time to enhance the drops and make you want to, nay, need to dance that much harder.</p>
<p>It is that need, that compulsion to dance to Moon Hooch that caused dance parties in the subways of New York City (which got them banned from at least one station), and it worked just as well at the Subterranean in Chicago. Although the crowd was sparser than I had expected, probably due to it being a Monday and that whole Stanley Cup thing, we were all getting down real hard.</p>
<p>And so were Moon Hooch, Jesus Christ. Let me just say that I&#8217;ve seen a lot of sax players in my life, and I&#8217;ve never, ever seen a saxophone played with as much aggression and intensity as Mike Wilbur and Wenzl. Their faces constantly strained to produce the most extreme and varying honks and shrieks, screaming bloody murder at the climax of some songs, and this is somehow all built around great pop melodies. Wilbur had entire solos of controlled sax noise, but even these have a definite melody.</p>
<p>Frenetic drummer James Muschler also got in on the weirdness with a two-minute rhythmic vocal solo comprised of all gibberish about two-thirds through the set. It was one of those things where everybody in the audience keeps looking at each other wordlessly asking, “What the fuck is going on here?” It was a good kind of “What the fuck” though, where you say it with a smile.</p>
<p>Ok, so it is established. Moon Hooch is super cool. The question now is whether they can transcend the novelty band label that they cannot avoid simply because of their unique instrumentation. They have the first part of the answer to that question down pat, which is to be badasses. The next step is to continue to grow musically and produce consistently, and that is tough even for bands with much less restricting instrumentation. That being said, their new songs are expanding well upon their previous material, and the tasteful use of effects in their live show find Moon Hooch traveling down a road only hinted at on their debut album.</p>
<p>Really though, the only indicator of future longevity you need is the response from the audience, and after an hour and a half of cave music, all we did was want more. We wanted it hard enough to bring the band back for two encores, even though the band didn&#8217;t seem to be expecting one. They just stood up there on stage, beaming and not knowing what to do as the audience refused to stop applauding. Then it was a kind of collective head shake and an, “Oh yeah, we&#8217;re supposed to play another song when this happens!”</p>

The crowd at Metro jumped on the chance to catch a full set from the quartet out of London, who had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFUXSZVXNaY" target="_blank">played <em>The Tonight Show</em> <em>with Jay Leno</em></a> just the night before.</p>
<p>The band kicked things off right from the very start, with guitarist Todd Howe riffing down to his knees at the end of opening song &#8220;The Runner&#8221;. This resulted in an eruption of cheers from the crowd that surely rivaled the glee of Blackhawks fans gathered in bars around the city for Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals. It&#8217;s actually Howe who brings the most &#8220;rock&#8221; to this band all around &#8211; engaging energetically with the crowd, tearing it up on the guitar and chiming in with presence on background vocals for tracks like &#8220;If You Run&#8221;. In comparison, Tennessee-born lead singer Nathan Nicholson gets more lost in the music as he delivers vocals that range from tranquil to towering. Bassist Adam Harrison and drummer Piers Hewitt are the two more reserved Englishmen on stage, but bring solid musicianship.</p>
<p>Song highlights include &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKTAXkpGceQ" target="_blank">Diamonds</a>&#8220;, which is the shining&#8230;umm&#8230; gem on new record <em>Promises</em>. Bathed in blue lights, Nicholson&#8217;s compelling voice soared until the song ended on its final kick snare. The fellas also brought us &#8220;Keep Moving&#8221;, &#8220;You Belong to Me&#8221; and &#8220;New York&#8221;, for which they switched things up for Howe and Harrison to join in on percussion as Nicholson took to the keys. Playing well to a Chicago crowd, Nicholson altered the song ending to sing &#8220;Chicagoooooo&#8221; and threw in a &#8220;Go Blackhawks&#8221; lyric for good measure. He then brought up the Cubs and Sox rivalry and went on record as a Cubs fan &#8211; which was too bad for the surprising number of Sox fans in attendance at the Wrigleyville venue. It was song after song of beautifully contrasted low and high vocals; including one track with a crescendo of drumbeats so grand that it could have shaken entire families of squirrels out of all the trees in Lincoln Park. The reaction from the crowd was so tremendous, you&#8217;d have thought Patrick Kane had just blazed a game-winning puck past the Bruins&#8217; goalie.</p>
<p>The Boxer Rebellion has been together for 12 years and it comes through. If you&#8217;re looking for a boisterous rock show, this may not be the set for you; but there&#8217;s no denying they play an incredibly tight set that offers fans a balanced combination of music that is at once emotional and forceful; delicate but strong; vulnerable yet self-assured.This is music well worth knowing, listening to and experiencing live.</p>

Headlining arenas, performing festivals and tonight they are the opener… The night has all the makings for a blockbuster. Anyone who is a fan of their style of music must have been so anxious for this night to come. Their ticket for a show that staged Guster and Dispatch promised roughly 2 hours of musical perfection to some. With all the experience in their back pocket, they know exactly what they are doing at all times. In no way was the crowd off the figurative edge of their seats. (Get it, because no one was sitting. So it’s figurative.)</p>
<p>I’ve seen Guster once before and honestly the second time around watching Brian Rosenworcel play one of his drum sets with his bare hands was just as shocking. My hands were throbbing just witnessing it. I can’t imagine the sensations he actually goes through. Keeping on the visual element of their performance, the lighting helped enhance every musical moment. During guitar glissando the stage lights went from pitch black to full blast. With every low register keyboard strike, the backstage lighting flashed like an exploding star. And the manipulation of moments didn’t only happen with the lights.</p>
<p>During “One Man Wrecking Crew” the intertwining of guitar and harmonica was masterful. This clearly isn’t their first rodeo. What I found absolutely great about their live performance was the simplicity. They didn’t need to play finger blazing, ear melting solos (yes, I know that isn’t their forte), but they make high impact moments through small motifs. The guitar-harmonica duo is a prime example of that. Neither buried the other and each response to the other elevated the performance. They put their musicianship front and center and it pays off. From playing multiple instruments, to dipping into various genre influences, they flexed their musical muscles.</p>
<p>I think the guys in Guster may have had as much fun as the dancing, floating audience did. From smiles across the board, to engaging the fans in conversation at each opportune moment; they were into every second of entertaining Chicago. Wanting to be there is only half the battle. Knowing what you’re doing is the other (and obviously most important) half. They do, and they know it too.</p>

The ideal situation would have included music filling our ears, sipping a cool beverage as the sun set on a warm June night. What did we have? A rainy Chicago day and a concert relocated to an arena due to outside forces. Off to a roaring start. However, the scenery was quickly a moot point as the roar of the crowd rattled my ears inside the UIC Pavilion once the trio walked across the stage. Chad was rocking the left over material from Brad’s jean hem job pinned to his shoulder by our very own set of buttons. And yes, Pete was wearing Brendan’s shoes he acquired during the great 2013 shoe trade off <a href="http://www.lostinconcert.com/interview-dispatch/" target="_blank">after an interview we had with the guys prior to the show</a>. You can say a little bit of Lost In Concert was up on stage that night.</p>
<p>The crowd did not let the venue’s atmosphere change their moods. The lights from behind the stage illuminated the crowd in front of me revealing all the tell tale signs of an outdoor festival. A tightly packed front displayed hands held high, waving slighting out of tempo from the music. In the back open areas allocated for fans dancing in circles, arms extended like airplanes. Location be damned! The smell of a peace pipe, wait what am I talking about…the over powering smell of peace pipes circulated the air. The party was not going to be put on hold because of crummy weather or being vacated from an outdoor venue. The tone isn’t set by where we are. It’s set by the musicians who can congregate an audience. It’s led by musicians that control the pace of the night through highs and lows. Through vocal breaks, guitar solos, textural changes, and visual stimulants.</p>
<p>The complete performance of their song “Passerby” evoked all the makings of an unforgettable live moment. The song grooved hard throughout every vocal harmony and rhythmic guitar strum. You couldn’t help but close your eyes and nod along. Yes, that’s exactly what I did for a while. If you were there I know you did too. When my eyes were open everyone around me was dancing around like they couldn’t see. Well maybe it was the booze, but regardless dancing and head bobbing were surrounding me. Then the guitar solo started. With a few melodic riffs the drum set’s hi-hat started opening a little bit. Energy built and a wall of sound was forming. The three of them, who were all on stringed instruments for this one, started congregating in the middle of the stage. Now in a circle, I can feel the crowd in full Mount Vesuvius mode.  No more swaying, no more drunken dancing. People are jumping and eating up every second of this. As the final chord is strummed the fans erupt. There is no souvenir you can take home like a memory like that. Concerts can be fun or enjoyable but often all anyone remembers is the first song, last song and if there was that “holy shit” moment.  Holy shit.</p>
<p>From top to bottom Dispatch had the crowd eating out of the palm of there hands. It could’ve been leading the crowd in a call in response, or as simple as getting the crowd to clap to the beat. Which by the way, how can so many people be terrible at that? It’s not very difficult. But I digress. It was quite the day for Chicagoans. The Blackhawks won game one of the Western Conference Finals, and Dispatch rolled through good vibes blazin’ to keep the party going.</p>

The three piece group (Chad, Brad and Pete), whose hands are working in multiple pots, balanced the lighter side of life and impactful insight with ease. From music, to futuristic bikes and what lies in between, this ride had a little bit of everything.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11888" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5844" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5844.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="389" /></p>

<p>For those of you who are unaware of Dispatch’s history, in 2002 they decided to take a hiatus. During their time apart they each pursued new musical endeavors. I had asked them if or how time apart had influenced their writing when they were reunited. Chad went right to the point, “I don’t think it changed much.” He went on to compare their reunion to riding a bike, which promptly lead to a shift in tone. The group seemed to have so much going on in their heads at once. And at any moment, like the flick of a light switch, the mood went from light-hearted to rather enlightening. The wheels are always in motion. The bike they ‘were riding’ so to speak, was described in full detail. A bike unlike any this world has ever heard of. This fabled cycling machine is fully equipped with “15 or 16 telescopes” and the unparalleled ability to travel with wheels, skis or underwater. In a way, this bike is Dispatch. Their description reflected the group’s mantra.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11889" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5851" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5851.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="389" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11892" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5876" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5876.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="389" /></p>
<p>To bring some of you up to speed with their abilities, these guys are multitalented to say the least. If it’s not Chad jumping on bass while Pete wails on a blues riff, its Brad jumping off his kit to grab a guitar as well. And their list of accomplishments does not stop with their music. They’ve had their hands in a few philanthropies over the years. They are currently involved with <a href="http://amplifyingeducation.org/" target="_blank">Amplifying Education</a>. From its website, “Amplifying Education campaign is all about exploring how small actions can make a big difference in the lives of children throughout the world”. The guys made it clear to me they are around to not only provide a musical outlet, but are working towards a greater good. “The three of us are united in helping children in any way we can,” Pete said. They’ve done service projects in various cities, including Chicago, with their focus on the well-being of kids. Some of these experiences outside of their musical world have even gone onto help in their writing process. Which in a way takes them full circle; from music writing, to helping others, to then being influenced by what they’ve have learned on their journey.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11891" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5872" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5872.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="389" /></p>
<p>I was curious to know if being influential to people via their music or being a tangible impact on people’s lives via their philanthropic ventures held different places in their hearts. Brad responded, “I think the experience of being in people’s headphones and also being in people’s, like, lives beyond the moment, it’s so amazing if you can accomplish both at the same time. I would never value one over the other.” He genuinely seemed touched by knowing the positive impact he has had on others. It was refreshing to hear. In fact when each of them talked about helping others and giving back, it seemed clear it meant a lot to them.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11896" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5924" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5924.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="389" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11894" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5893" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5893.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="389" /></p>
<p>For a group that has helped others in so many ways, I found it a bit odd they have been called “the biggest band nobody&#8217;s ever heard of”. But they seem to embrace it. Explaining how it held a cool underdog feel to it. How it proved they did not have lazy fans. They seemed positive about everything they talked about. It was really a great vibe to be around people with such passion in what they were doing. All they stand for and take part in separates them quite a bit from their colleagues.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11895" title="Dispatch Interview at UIC Pavillion 2013 _DSC5901" src="http://www.lostinconcert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dispatch-Interview-at-UIC-Pavillion-2013-_DSC5901.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="600" /></p>
<p>What’s next on the docket for Dispatch? Your guess is as good as mine. On June 4<sup>th</sup> they released <em>Ain’t No Trip to Cleveland Vol. 1</em>. An album consisting of live material compiled since their reformation in 2011. Could this be the first of many live releases? It could be. We’ll all have to wait and see. I will wait in anticipation with the rest of you. Wait to see when their next studio album will be. Wait to see what else they plan on doing to give back to the community. And I will definitely be waiting to see when they roll through Chicago again. I can confidently say the next move won’t be ordinary. The guys I met were anything but ordinary. There is absolutely more to them then what meets the eye.</p>
