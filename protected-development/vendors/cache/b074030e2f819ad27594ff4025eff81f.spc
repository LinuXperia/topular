</dl>

<p>I love being able to connect people with new ideas or new
ways of thinking about things.</p>
<p>And that is just what I got to do today during a visit from
Alexis Caudell, director of the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mitchell.lib.in.us/">Mitchell Community Public Library</a>. The
Library is planning a major renovation, and Alexis wants to create an
interactive exhibit about local history. A very cool idea ... but where to begin?</p>
<p>Alexis called me last month to ask me that question. And
while I could have sent her to some great websites and books, I was able to
offer her something even better. As a <a class="external-link" href="../our-services/local-history-services/local-history-partners">Local History Partner member</a>&nbsp;of IHS, the Mitchell Community Public Library can work with Local History
Services to consult with other members of the IHS staff. So I set up a meeting
for Alexis with a couple of people who work on IHS exhibits.</p>
<p>Alexis met with Barb Dirks, the IHS director of Collections
Digital Resources, to talk about the ins and outs of digitizing collections, and
what is involved in researching and writing one of our <a class="external-link" href="../indiana-experience/destination-indiana-1">Destination Indiana</a>&nbsp;journeys, as well as other ways to use
collections images. From Luke Smith, our
senior director of Information Technology, she got to hear about the pluses and
minuses of working with different kinds of software and what's involved in creating
interactive touchscreens. And then there
was the fun discussion about using large wall spaces with <a class="external-link" href="authors/sanderson">Sarah Anderson</a>,
one of our graphics designers who works in our <a class="external-link" href="../indiana-experience/you-are-there">You Are There</a>&nbsp;experiences, as well as many other IHS exhibits.</p>
<p>Barb, Luke and Sarah couldn't answer every question Alexis
had or make decisions about what her interactive exhibit will ultimately look
like, but they could talk about the many possibilities out there and share with
her some lessons learned from their experiences. My job was just to ask
questions and watch as the discovery process unfold. I can't wait to see what Alexis comes up
with!</p>

<p>Journalism in America experienced dramatic growth and
development during the Civil War Era. It
was the first time an American war had been covered by the press, and there was
an extremely high demand for information throughout the country. In order to accommodate the public’s need for
news regarding the war, journalists began to use new practices and technologies
and helped to shape the future of journalism.</p>
<p>One of the most influential publications of the time was <em>Harper’s Weekly, A Journal of Civilization</em>.<em> Harper’s Weekly</em> began publication
prior to the Civil War in 1857 as a venture of the New York publishing firm
Harper and Brothers. At first, it
consisted of a mixture of news, gossip and poetry. However, when the war began,
its pages became filled with stories, illustrations and editorials regarding
many aspects of the war. It played a
crucial role in keeping Americans informed of the war’s progress and eventually
became the most widely read publication of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Harper’s Weekly</em>
expanded the scope of journalism of the time by providing news-hungry citizens
with varied reporting including eyewitness accounts, political cartooning and
photojournalism. It was an innovative
form of news reporting that played political, economic and social roles. It allowed readers to keep up-to-date with
events occurring during the war, positions of foreign countries on various war
issues and the effects the war was having on the economy. Along with this information, it also
presented poetry, songs and essays, some of which were directly from soldiers
themselves. These conveyed to readers
the difficulty of war life and had a great social impact.</p>
<p>As the Indiana Historical Society commemorates the 150th
anniversary of the Civil War, <em>Harper’s
Weekly</em> is featured in glass cases in the William H. Smith Memorial Library
at the History Center. The pages displayed reflect the week’s news from <em>Harper’s Weekly </em>in 1863. This is a unique opportunity to see the publication that was one of the
main influencers of news during America’s greatest conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The library is open to the public
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.</p>

<p>Our senior director of Collections asked me once about
some of my “gee whiz” moments here, which got me to thinking about the
interesting people I’ve encountered in my work. We’re always excited to share
our collections with book publishers, documentary producers and the public.</p>
<p>Last year, I really enjoyed being able to share photographs with the BBC
Scotland for a documentary they produced about Alexander Gardner, the Scottish
immigrant famed as one of the principal photographers of our Civil War. Books and
documentaries enable us to share history on a grand scale, but there are also
some small, almost private moments that I’ve been privileged to experience.</p>
<p>Many years ago, an elderly man came into the library and said he had seen a
picture of himself on the wall of a local restaurant; he wanted copies for his
children. After some searching, I found it. In the photograph, he was just
walking down the street with a small box in his hand. It turned out that he was
a jewelry engraver and was carrying something away from a store to his studio.
As I talked with him about the photograph I wondered what it felt like to find
oneself in the historical society. Over the years I’ve encountered a lot of
people who find themselves here – in one way or another. I know I did. <br />_________________________________</p>

<p>Did anyone else catch the Scripp's Spelling Bee on ESPN last week? My wife and I caught the last half of the final contest, and since we both work with kids of varying ages, we love watching the personalities and "quirks" of the students. I was also impressed that ESPN, the "Worldwide Leader in Sports," was carrying the contest. How cool is it for them to give those students a stage like that? I will also add that I did spell one word right somewhere in the final10. It was pure luck and I went about 1-for-74.</p>
<img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/BeforeLugar.JPG/image_preview" alt="NHD 2011 Capitol" />
<p>The spelling bee is a classic, but <a class="external-link" href="../historyday">National History Day</a> is a&nbsp;program that is just as exciting and, we would argue,&nbsp;more analytical for students. Indiana's NHD State Contest took place at Marian University on April 27 and we are sending 57 very bright students to the national contest. You can see a list of our <a class="external-link" href="http://in.nhd.org/ud/php/winnersPubResultsSTATE.php?cid=13">medalists heading to D.C. here</a> and a <a class="external-link" href="http://in.nhd.org/ud/php/winnersPubSA.php?cid=13">list of special award winners here</a>.</p>
<p>With many of us staying in the University of Maryland dorms, we have a busy schedule next week including two full days of presentations and competition, student parties and dances, congressional visits, opening and closing ceremonies, and a swanky night at the National Museum of American History for NHD attendees only. I have done the math, and it looks like I will have 3.5 hours total to explore 38 museums and monuments this year. Can't wait.</p>

<p><img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/BeccaBlogMay.jpg/image_preview" alt="History kids" />In March, I wrote a blog post about our collaboration with Decatur Middle School and Valley Mills Elementary School on an activity for our upcoming Indiana Bicentennial Train project. I met with this group of bright young people last week and wanted to share their idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team chose a 1907 railroad map from our collection as the basis for a game visitors can play when they visit the Train this fall. Emma Key, one of the 8th graders on the team, said her objective was to make it active. "We wanted something active with competition, and that's when we got the idea for a game," she says.</p>
<p>Using the railroad routes and stops on the map, visitors will engage in a race to travel across the map. Miniature depot icons will mark where players need to stop and answer a question in order to move forward. The questions will focus on the locations with some broader Indiana history to make connections to the academic standards.</p>
<p>The next step is for the team to write a few questions for each depot site and for the IHS team to figure out the best way to fabricate the map so it is large enough and holds up in the elements. We are excited to work with Decatur Township learners and are looking forward to featuring this activity at the Train!</p>

<p>Abe Lincoln here. Although it has been 100, two score, and eight years since I was shot to death while attending a play with my Mary, Major Rathbone and his fiancée, Miss Harris, I decided to stop by the Lanham Gallery on the fourth floor of the History Center to see the exhibition commemorating the sesquicentennial of our Civil War. The people there have put up the second part of the exhibition, covering essentially the second half of this bloody conflict. Its title is <em>The Civil War from Gettysburg to Appomattox </em>and it includes items depicting the war from the beginning of 1863 through Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse on April 9, 1865. I was killed less than one week after that.</p>
<p>The exhibition includes representations of events, places and people of particular interest to Hoosiers, including myself, as it was in Indiana where I spent my formative years. These include Confederate Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan's raid into Indiana; a panoramic photograph of an 11th Indiana Battery encampment at Chattanooga, Tenn.; photographs of Camp Morton in Indianapolis, which held Confederate prisoners of war; a diary entry from a Miami County soldier in the 26th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment; and an emancipation record of a former slave who became a member of the Weaver Settlement in Grant County.</p>
<p>There are also prints illustrating battles at Vicksburg and Gettysburg; 1864 election-year political cartoons; a couple of illustrations by Thomas Nast in <em>Harper's Weekly; </em>maps; letters; lithographs of my generals and admirals and of my little speech at the dedication of the cemetery at Gettysburg, Penn. (which I am surprised to find has been remembered all these years); and depictions of the fall of Richmond, Va., and Gen. Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. There are some likenesses of me hanging on the walls of this gallery, but it was a strange experience to encounter a life-size statue of myself.</p>

<p>I’m a fairly private person, so it has taken me a while to warm up to social media. I’ve only been on Facebook for three years (yes, only three!), and I only have about 100 friends (yes, only 100!). I haven’t yet sent my first tweet or created a profile on LinkedIn. But even so, social media has now become a daily part of my life. I check out what my friends and favorite organizations are doing every day. I watch everything and anything on YouTube. I log on to Pinterest when I’m in need of aesthetic nourishment. In short, I can interact at the level I want, with the content I want – and I have tailored my social media use to fit my life.<br /><br />So how do museums fit into this picture? Even though, by many standards, I’m a social media newbie and minimalist, I am engaged with the world virtually in many ways I couldn’t be offline. Often, I only learn about new animals at the zoo or what happened this day in history or an event I really want to attend at our local museum through social media. This, I suppose, is the crucial point. I don’t have to search for the news – it comes to me. And it makes me feel connected to these people, sites and organizations on a personal level because they are taking the time to share their world with me.<br /><br />Even if I hadn’t decided to sign on, social media is here to stay. The sites may change, and perhaps Facebook (currently with 1.06 billion monthly active users), Twitter (500 million users), YouTube (4 billion views per day), Flickr (8 billion photos) and others will be replaced by new outlets in the years to come (<a class="external-link" href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/resource-how-many-people-use-the-top-social-media/http://">data source: Digital Marketing Ramblings</a>). But no matter the platform, museums who want to continue to engage with their audiences in creative ways are using social media to achieve this. Of course, social media can never replace the value of face-to-face communication and the authentic experience in a physical space, and it won’t reach everyone. Yet these virtual platforms, when used well, can be powerful tools to help you make new friends and keep more people connected to your museum.<br /><br />Here are a few interesting resources to check out:</p>

<p>So, I never knew my great grandparents were bee keepers.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/SiteSearch.jpg/image_preview" alt="Site search" />This might not sound like a big deal, but when you are researching your family history, finding fun facts like these can make the story that much more complete and interesting. I found a reference to their involvement in a beekeeping convention in a 1920 newspaper article from the <em>Mooresville Times</em>.</p>
<p>We have been discovering a lot of interesting facts about people and events with our new newspaper database. Researchers have found ancestors on both sides of the law (both arrest records and reports of stopping crime). We have found texts of speeches made to the state legislature, how Hoosiers coped with the 1913 flood, and advertisements to early businesses in the state.</p>
<p>Newspapers can be a great source for research and now they are much easier to search and access. The Indiana Historical Society recently partnered with Newspaper Archive to digitize 5,625 reels of microfilm, which represents more than 2.5 million newspaper page images dated 1924 or earlier. Now, 760 individual Indiana newspaper titles representing the vast majority of the state are now available for research on the web. Researchers can search newspaper pages by keyword or browse particular issues. To make the news even better, folks can access the database for free in the reference room of IHS’s William Henry Smith Memorial Library.</p>
<p>The Library is open to the public fro 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. If you are unable to visit, personal subscriptions are available for purchase through NewspaperArchive.com. Come and try the new database – maybe your ancestor was a beekeeper or a bank robber!</p>

<p>My grandfather passed away three weeks ago. I'm 31 years old, and this is the first grandparent I've lost. I consider myself very lucky.</p>
<p>After the funeral, we gathered at the house to start going through his stuff. The voice behind the stories was gone but the stuff remained. The bowling trophies and golf equipment. The clocks and wind chimes. The crazy as-seen-on-tv gadgets. Pieces of a life well lived.</p>
<p>In the history field, we work with objects from the past all the time. Artifacts are categorized, labeled, assessed and conserved. Decisions about what to keep are based on a collections policy. But I didn't know how to translate my professional knowledge to this personal situation. It was overwhelming to see all of his things knowing he wasn't there.</p>
<p>We each handle death and grief in our own way. I chose to remember my grandpa by taking his bowling pin clock, the 1963 newspaper announcing Kennedy had been shot he had shoved in the rafters of the basement and the teddy bear I made for him when I was little. Each triggers memories of him so they remain out of sight for now. That's how I assigned value to his things – what reminds me of him the most?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, until I find a great spot for that bowling pin clock, here's to the memory of my grandfather, Kent Loofbourrow. Rest in peace, gramps.</p>

 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px">The History Center's 1913 exhibit features and assembly line where students work together to build relief bundles.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you have followed politics and education trends over the past few years you have probably noticed the&nbsp;shift in focus toward a few key subjects, for this blog posts' sake, most notably the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) initiative.&nbsp;There are many critics of STEM, both for and against, and all of their points are for a different blog post. What I want to talk about here is how we use STEM ideas for the newest You Are There Experience: <em>1913: A City Under Water. </em>Whether you love it or hate it, STEM has serious influence in the education world today which only seems to grow with time.</p>
<p>First, some context: STEM supports many things, notably for our purposes, "a strong emphasis on learning environments on hands-on, experimental, inquiry-based and learner-centered student experiences and activities" and "integration of STEM-focused activities ... directed at learning environments outside the K-12 classroom." To me, the prior quote is a fancy way of saying that we as educators should not be presenting <em>to</em> or <em>at</em> the children, but involving them as active participants in our experiences and activities. And the latter, well, that's us. So, kinesthetic learning and establishing a culture where learning exists not <em>solely</em> in the classroom? Sign me up.</p>
<p>The 1913 experience puts visitors in Wulf's Hall, the second floor of a saloon-turned-relief-station in Indianapolis in the wake of a massive flood event. Our task as educators was to develop an activity that related to STEM subjects, met the ideas mentioned above while staying true to the people, the time and the event.</p>
<dl class="image-right captioned">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/1913ReliefCard.jpg"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/1913ReliefCard.jpg/image_preview" alt="1913 Relief Card" title="1913 Relief Card" height="300" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px">Students interpret information on cards to determine the supplies and quantities needed to complete a task.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this experience, students assemble relief bundles for flood sufferers who need supplies like bread, beans and rice. Upon entering the space, they&nbsp; receive relief cards with a family and the supplies requested. Students then work in teams to determine how much of each supply go into the bundles based on the number of adults and children in each household. This is&nbsp;an activity that occurred in the Wulf's Hall in 1913, staying authentic to the space, while the students work with math, fractions, problem-solving and teamwork skills. Ideally this activity will drive conversation with interpreters while changing the space itself, as students deposit their assembled bundles in an area for delivery.&nbsp;Another activity is the supply depot, where students measure and count bags of supplies that will go on the assembly line.</p>
<p>While environmental science seemed like the natural (pun intended) focus, it would have been difficult to include that in the context of the 1913 recovery inside the space. However, flood science is discussed in a supplemental content room and will be featured in an upcoming flood science cart. With the science cart, students will consider the story of the 1913 flood, a pre-human settlement flood, and what a similar event would look like today, using maps and experimenting with water saturation of different building materials from each time period.</p>
<p>We feel that all of these activities stay true to the <em>history</em> of the story while also integrating STEM subjects and principles. What STEM-related activities would you like to see in You Are There 1913:<em> A City Under Water?</em></p>

<p>Often when I visit museums, I overhear bits and pieces of conversations and random comments. Frequently I hear people complaining about kids walking around museums, holding their phones and texting.</p>
<p><em>“Those kids are not paying any attention.” <br />“They’re being disrespectful and not listening.” <br />“How can they be in a museum and not be completely absorbed by the history and art that’s right in front of them?”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I have one of those kids. She’s attached to her phone. It’s her connection to the world beyond school and family. I’ll admit that I’ve been frustrated on occasion because I want her to communicate the way I did when I was 15. But, she doesn’t. She is very much of her generation. And, she texts when we’re at museums.</p>
<p>I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who also happens to be the director of a small museum. Our conversation was about kids, cell phones and museums. She said that very often those kids are texting about what they’re doing at that very moment. They’re sharing information about their world. My friend told me that if they’re texting about her museum, that’s great. She says that a kid will listen to another kid and that they’re communicating with each other in a way she never can.</p>
<p>In fact, my daughter volunteers at the Carnegie Museum of Montgomery County. At their recent Pi Day event, she texted some friends about what she was doing that day. Later, those friends came to the museum. It seems to me that we should stop being frustrated by those kids and their phones and embrace the fact that they are our connection to new audiences.</p>
<p>Kids communicate better with each other than with adults. They do what their peers do. They share their cool moments. When those cool moments include museums, they’ll text/tweet/chat about it.</p>

<p>One of the things that I enjoy about my work at the Indiana Historical Society is the interrelatedness of our collections and, through those collections, my introduction to ordinary people – the common men and women of history, many who have done extraordinary things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though we have much material at the William H. Smith Library dating from the Old Northwest Territory period and earlier until the present time that focuses on the famous and infamous, most of our more than 50,000 printed cataloged items (including books, pamphlets, periodicals, broadsides, sheet music and maps), 1.7 million photographs, 5,400 manuscript collections, 3,400 artifacts and paintings, and 57,000 online digital images give evidence to the lives of little- or lesser-known individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several years ago when Laura Sheerin Gaus wrote <em>Shortridge High School, 1864-1981</em>,<em> in retrospect,</em> she included a reference to Mary Rann, the first African-American student to gain entrance to Indianapolis High School (later Shortridge). Prior to Gaus’ 1985 book, Pastor Moses Broyles <em>(History of Second Baptist Church) </em>detailed the advocacy work of he and others to get Rann enrolled in the high school in 1872.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school was located on the northwest corner of the Circle and Market Street, later moving to Pennsylvania Street, before opening at 3401 N. Meridian St., its current location. With help from Abram C. Shortridge, then superintendent of the Indianapolis Public Schools, Rann enrolled and graduated in 1876.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day when I was in the vault researching an unrelated reference inquiry, I looked at the Record of Examinations, 1868–1883 (M0482, Shortridge High School Collection). As my eyes scrolled down a page, I came across some 1876 student grades. Before I thought to look for it, Mary Rann’s name stood out on the page. I was ecstatic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a history high moment.</p>

<p>The <a class="external-link" href="http://www.digitalarchives.in.gov/">Indiana Digital Archives</a> has made available new materials for researchers interested in Indiana’s heritage. The Marion County Court Records Index includes information on nearly 130,000 court records created between 1822 and 1930. The database includes case files, bonds and licenses, summonses, subpoenas, jury lists and coroner’s inquests.</p>
<p>This index encompasses most of the records transferred to the Indiana State Archives during the early 1960s by the Marion County Clerk. It includes the first session of the Marion County Circuit Court in 1822, the 1829 establishment of a probate court, the courts of common pleas, and the 1871 establishment of the Superior Court of Marion County.</p>
<p>“The inclusion of the Marion County Court records into the Indiana Digital Archives creates one of the best resources for legal research and genealogy in the state,” says Jim Corridan, Indiana State Archivist." This database brings to life the stories of thousands of Hoosiers and the legal conflicts faced by our ancestors.”</p>
<p>While not all of the Marion County Court documents have survived, Marion County court order books and complete record books are available at the State Archives for further research. Marion County court documents created after 1930 are not included in this database.</p>
<p>The Marion County Court records were indexed by Indiana State Archives volunteer Mary Etta Boren, who began working on the project in 2005. Friends of the Indiana State Archives volunteers have been hard at work for nearly two decades creating indices for many of the state's records. From before statehood in 1816 and on through to its approaching bicentennial, Indiana has been home to millions of settlers and immigrants. The Digital Archives enables Hoosiers and people worldwide to view the vast collection of historical and vital records housed at the Indiana State Archives.</p>

<p><img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/HT%20Meeting%20Pic.jpg/image_preview" alt="Train meeting" />The Indiana Bicentennial Train will make its debut this fall in northern Indiana. An exhibit on the train will look at pieces of Indiana's 200 years of history while tents outside the train will contain hands-on activities, a first-person interpreter, and a community art space. It will be free to visit, and school groups are encouraged to make a reservation and attend.</p>
<p>While brainstorming activities for the tent, we hit a road block. We knew we wanted to use maps from our library's vast collection but struggled to come up with a way to get young people engaged on site. Our solution was to go straight to the source: collaborate with a school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Decatur Township Schools on the southwest side of Indianapolis were already doing project-based learning with their kids. They present learners (students are called learners in this environment) with real-world problems so they can work on solutions that are relevant and usable. Corporate and organizational partners are used as much as possible. Each learner has a netbook and is encouraged to use Twitter to communicate. (Follow them @ApexNTCommunity.)</p>
<p>I met with a small group of bright 6th and 8th graders yesterday and was impressed with their professionalism. I gave them an overview of the train project, a list of suggested maps from our collection and sent them on their way. We regroup in a few weeks to see what ideas they have come up with. I am so excited to work with this group and can't wait to hear their ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often in our "adult" world, we try to create things we think kids would like. Then, we evaluate our ideas after they have been completed. I challenge my colleagues in the museum world and beyond to think of young people first and get their ideas in the brainstorming phase. Kids are smart – let's treat them that way.</p>

<p>This is my favorite part of exhibit design. It's that time in the process when all the planning and designing starts to come together. Last week, <a title="Making of  You Are There 1913: &lt;em&gt;A City Under Water&lt;/em&gt;" class="internal-link" href="/blog/making-of-you-are-there-1913-a-city-under-water">you might remember</a> the You Are There space looking like this:</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_WulfHallBefore.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_WulfHallBefore.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_WulfHallBefore" title="5_WulfHallBefore" height="282" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>Well, as you can see from how it looks this week, our fabricators, Roger and Jim, are well on their way to completely transforming the space:</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_WulfHallAfter.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_WulfHallAfter.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_WulfHallAfter" title="5_WulfHallAfter" height="279" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>After removing all the brick and painting everything black, they are now installing the wood planks that will make up the walls of our 1913 relief station.</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">

 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:268px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>We have big plans for the room that prepares our visitors before they <a title="You Are There" class="internal-link" href="/indiana-experience/you-are-there/you-are-there">travel back in time</a>. Some of you might remember the little room that we had for our Prohibition exhibit being on the cozy side. Our team decided to extend that space into a larger exhibit room that will be able to adequately house all the important content we have planned.</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_ContentRoom_01.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_ContentRoom_01.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_ContentRoom_01" title="5_ContentRoom_01" height="267" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>Our design interns from Herron School of Art and Design, Cory and Ellie, spent a lot of time in the room during its construction. Being in the space with your sketchbook in hand really helps your designs translate from drawings into physical objects.</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_ContentRoom_02.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_ContentRoom_02.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_ContentRoom_02" title="5_ContentRoom_02" height="300" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>Roger and Jim extended the walls, drywalled and prepared the space for painting.</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_ContentRoom_03.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_ContentRoom_03.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_ContentRoom_03" title="5_ContentRoom_03" height="267" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px"></dd>

<p>The space will be very dramatic.&nbsp;We are blowing up two images of the destruction from the 1913 flood&nbsp;from our collection&nbsp;and wallpapering the space.&nbsp;Our interns from the Art Institute of Indianapolis, Lani and Jojo, painted the walls last week. This creates a nice smooth surface for the large images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things are very busy in our studio. The team is working hard on all the little elements that will come together over the next three weeks.</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_LaniComputer.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_LaniComputer.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_LaniComputer" title="5_LaniComputer" height="267" width="400" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>Lani is making a custom font based on period appropriate hand writing&nbsp;just for this exhibit. We will use the final font throughout the relief station. We always reference original items from the time period when dressing the space. These custom reproductions make each You Are There space unique and realistic.</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_LukeTouchscreen.JPG"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/blog/uploads/exhibition-images/5_LukeTouchscreen.JPG/image_preview" alt="5_LukeTouchscreen" title="5_LukeTouchscreen" height="400" width="268" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:268px"></dd>
</dl>

<p>The larger items are worked on, in stages, by multiple people.&nbsp;The Senior Director of Information Technology, Luke, has been spending time in our studio testing out an interactive developed by our design intern, Ellie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ellie has been designing and developing this beautiful touchscreen interactive for the exhibit for many weeks. When using the touchscreen, the user will feel like they are looking at images through a window. Roger built this custom box for the touchscreen inside a vintage window. It is gorgeous in person. I can't wait for the touchscreen to be installed inside and see it hung on the wall.&nbsp;</p>
<dl class="image-left captioned image-inline">
