The Indianapolis Motor Speedway's ambitious digital media crew wanted to go big this year. The plan was simple: Ask race fans to upload photos on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #Indy500orBust. &ldquo;We wanted our biggest advocates, our fans, to share their experiences, their journeys, and their 'or bust' moments with their friends in hopes that they, too, would participate,&rdquo; says Brian Simpson, digital media producer for the IMS.</p>
<p>Thus a web- and app-based photo album of nearly everything imaginable was born, including images of glittery nails, inebriated couples smooching (Snakepit, ahoy!), and one Mike Tyson holding an &ldquo;Indy 500 or Bust&rdquo; sign. The catchy slogan was even seen speeding around the track on race day courtesy of IndyCar driver and Indy 500 competitor Josef Newgarden&rsquo;s helmet. (He became the campaign&rsquo;s unofficial spokesman.)</p>
<p>The total of 11,400 photo submissions (as of press time) was expected and nothing to tweet home about&mdash;but 240 million impressions on Twitter and reaching more than 53 million Instagrammers wasn't to be scoffed at either. Thanks to its viral nature, Instagram's blog featured the campaign on Saturday, May 25, the day before the race. Says Simpson, &ldquo;To be acknowledged by the platform that we built the campaign around was incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, this noble assistance from race fans doesn&rsquo;t excuse their own naughty ways. When asked about potentially shocking photo submissions received, Simpson says, "The most probably came on Coors Light Carb Day. It&rsquo;s tough to say is there was just one that really shocked me, but there were several that we deemed inappropriate for the campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stay classy, Indy.</p>

She got to experience the <a title="Kanaan" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1322807">celebration</a> of Kanaan's Indy 500 victory firsthand. </em><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>FOUR TIPS FOR WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND WINS THE INDY 500</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />1. <strong>To prepare for the waning moments of the race</strong> that your boyfriend's team is winning, you will want the following on your person: a paper bag (for aid in breathing); tissues (for the inevitable weeping&mdash;see next tip); a throat lozenge (due to screaming); and brass knuckles or a taser (to clear path to boyfriend at conclusion of race). Also helpful: tranquilizers. If unavailable, <a title="Best Bars" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/best-bars">drinking</a> four caipirinhas will suffice.<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/team-kanaan.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /><br />&nbsp;<br />2. <strong>You will shed copious tears.</strong> Sobbing, gulping tears. After that, you will probably look pretty blotchy, and your nose may swell up a bit. This is not a tip per se; it is more a warning.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. <strong>If, after your boyfriend's team wins, you and he get invited to the post-race dinner,</strong> be aware that the skirt you bought at Target and the shirt you purchased second-hand are probably not the right sartorial choices. In the event you do wear the skirt you bought at Target and the shirt you bought second-hand, expect to be upstaged by literally every other woman in the room. Including the waitress.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/wreath2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="204" />4. <strong>Remember: Not everybody cares.</strong> A partial list of people who don't care includes the following: your dog; the cashier at the gas station where you bought lottery tickets the next day, figuring you were on a roll (you were not); and the non‒English-speaking waitress where you ate breakfast the following Tuesday.<br /><br /></p>

Not because he can&rsquo;t write&mdash;he&rsquo;s editor-at-large for <a title="Yahoo" href="http://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/alex-lloyd-goes-racecar-driver-car-critic-yahoo-125939233.html" target="_blank">Yahoo! Autos</a>&mdash;but rather because, as he peered through the glass that separates the scribes from the crowd roar and turbocharged thunder of the Indy 500, it was clear that he&rsquo;d rather be on the other side of it.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a title="Lloyd" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2012/05/17/the-drivers-seat-alex-lloyd">Lloyd</a> drove the Boy Scouts of America car to a fourth-place finish in this race. Now, like so many quality drivers who have sniffed success here&mdash;recent top-fivers like Vitor Miera and Tomas Scheckter&mdash;he&rsquo;s on the outside looking in, and not by choice. He has the drive, but not a ride.</p>
<p>The fate twist was all the more poignant this afternoon, when perennial oh-so-close finisher Tony Kanaan, who had previously placed fifth or better five times, finally raised the Borg-Warner <a title="Kanaan" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1320539">Trophy</a>. &ldquo;Being here and seeing this,&rdquo; Lloyd said as he surveyed the mechanics closing up shop on pit row below the Media Center, &ldquo;I want to be out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lloyd hasn&rsquo;t given up on the dream, though, and the Brit has found a way to stay behind the wheel while he waits out an IndyCar ride. Since March, he&rsquo;s been driving and <a title="Yahoo" href="http://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/2013-shelby-gt350-lives-carroll-shelby-legacy-motoramic-180039879.html" target="_blank">reviewing</a> exotic production cars for Yahoo!. True, the gig doesn&rsquo;t quite match the thrill of charging down the backstretch at 200-plus miles per hour and plunging into Turn Three. But it&rsquo;s still pretty darned cool. This isn&rsquo;t <em>Consumer Reports</em>, pushing minivans around a closed course and rating grocery-bag capacity. Lloyd is driving some of the finest, fastest vehicles allowed on the road, and in romantic, far-flung locales to boot. In a kind of classier, European version of <em>The Canonball Run</em>, he and four other auto journalists recently drove through the Italian Alps in $180,000 <a title="Audi" href="http://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/2014-audi-r8-everyday-supercar-motoramic-drives-212530043.html;_ylt=AixIh.H9427kIr3u5uAKViRGca9_;_ylu=X3oDMTFxbGRudXJhBG1pdANCbG9nIEF1dGhvciBJbmRleDIgTW90b3JhbWljBHBvcwM0MwRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nSW5kZXg-;_ylg=X3oDMTFrODdzYXZuBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANhdXRob3IEcHQDc2VjdGlvbnM-;_ylv=3" target="_blank">Audi R8s</a>. It wasn&rsquo;t until they finally arrived in Germany that the hosts of the media junket informed them they had racked up $20,000 in speeding violations along the way. Which the carmaker politely paid.</p>
<p>The writing keeps paychecks coming while Lloyd waits out the possibility of meeting the team owner or investor who would underwrite his return to the 500. But with IndyCar&rsquo;s adoption of the Dallara chassis and its higher buy-in costs, he says, the prospect of finding a ride feels even more remote.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lloyd will have to make do with driving the new Dodge Viper scheduled for delivery to the driveway of his Indianapolis home later this week. He&rsquo;ll drive it around for a few days, try to share the experience of sitting in a dream car with a longing Internet audience, and hope his article gets main-page placement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the Indianapolis 500. But it&rsquo;s not so bad. &ldquo;Going into it, I didn&rsquo;t realize what people get to do in this job, and how much I would enjoy it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun.&rdquo;</p>

Beer for breakfast on the lawn, Jagermeister girls handing out shot-sized bottles, and of course, an overly-amped crowd at the front of the stage. A chilly morning began with small groups of tank-topped girls and boys sporting styles including the American flag to overalls, looks that would be weird anywhere else.</p>

<p>As containers of liquor and beer emptied, these small groups married into one loving bunch. The volume shot through the roof by 9 a.m. as homegrown Topher Jones and huge national DJs Diplo and Afrojack took turns enlivening the crowd. My challenge amidst the fray: To stay starkly sober as partiers raced each other to the finish line of utmost intoxication. </p>

<p>By 10 a.m., “Can I take your photo?” had become rhetorical. Of course they didn’t care. Who doesn’t want their photo taken while drunk? As it turned out, my scanning the crowd for good photo opportunities turned into miscommunicated stares exchanged with belligerent boys. “Why are you standing alone,” one asked. Holding back giggles, I explained my purpose at the Snake Pit—but I can't say he comprehended it.</p>

<p>Girls rushed to the stage during the party's third hour, eager to participate in the Snake Pit's customary "twerking" contest—so far from <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>. I want to say their mothers would be proud. Perhaps the party’s accelerated buzz slowed down after my departure. That said, I doubt it.</p>

(Former U.S. gymnast <strong>Shawn Johnson</strong>, the winner of <em>Dancing with the Stars </em>season 8, fell ill today after the parade and didn't appear tonight.)</p>
<p>Here's what they told me, a few stories among picking favorites in tomorrow's 97th running of the Indy 500:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wieber, looking resplendent in purple&mdash;and who hasn't been to Indy since Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions ("for all of half a day")&mdash;said she has no particular fave in Sunday's race: "Whoever has the prettiest car."<br /><br /></li>
<li><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/2013/SnakepitBall-JordynWieber.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="355" /><strong>Kelly Hansen</strong>, lead singer of Foreigner, appeared in a paisley-detailed jacket and Puma kicks, saying, "I'm kind of tweet buddies with Graham Rahal, so I have to root for him. Other than that, I just like to see things go fast."<br /><br /></li>
<li>Gregarious actor Middlebrooks said he was amazed by the comfort for fans at the 500 Festival Parade, noting the bleachers and the seats both, and he thanked the weather gods for today's overcast cool: "I sweat like a pig, so this was perfect." He added, "I'm in such awe of these drivers, and they're giving me this adrenaline, and I'm just gonna be eating everything in sight." Beware, IMS elephant ears: Your days are numbered if this guy has his wish.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Mayor Ballard displayed a great grasp on racing culture and the mechanics, referring to perennial favorite Tony Kanaan as "TK" and noting that Simona De Silvestro is driving a better car than last year. "I love Simona, she's hilarious, and I'm sad that TK hasn't won yet. He's been doing it for so long. I also enjoy Hinch [James Hinchcliffe]." Ballard also had Sunday's Pacers game, Game 3 of the NBA's Eastern Conference Finals, on his mind, saying that he expects an Indiana win and will be bookending his day with that contest after the race.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Tyler Clary, the London2012 backstroke gold winner, mentioned his interest in stock-car or IndyCar racing, as he transitions his career away from swimming. His 500 fave? Close friend Conor Daly, appearing in his first race in this "Greatest Spectacle." Said Clary, "I've always been a racer at heart." He then delved into a great story about how his grandmother drove him around as a tyke and, when she was passed by another driver, he thrust his entire body forward. She realized that, pressed the gas, and passed that driver, at which point her young grandson grinned up at her. Clary went to the IndyCar Academy early this year and is quite serious about his next maneuver to car racing, complimenting Indy 500 drivers like so: "Swimming and racing have many similarities. You have to be presentable all along the way, and the physicality of those G forces for two hours gives me huge respect for them as athletes." Clary was earnest, involved, and thoughtful as we spoke. Consider him the anti-Ryan Lochte.<br /><br /></li>
<li><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/2013/SnakepitBall-McAfee&amp;princesses.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="264" />Pat McAfee brought up the checkered carpet's rear, and what a show he put on for reporters, telling me that security guards didn't freak out when he left his parade car today to take a photo with a fan. "I had no security guy in a suit," he said, "It was free reign. I just enjoyed seeing all the people." His horse of sorts in Sunday's 200 laps? Why, pole sitter Ed Carpenter, the only driver who is also a racing team owner. "I've befriended him, and he's an Indy guy. He lives here. Absolutely I have a favorite."</li>
</ul>

The drivers kicked off this otherwise relatively dreary Saturday with a celebratory breakfast at 10:30 a.m. Without time to spare for digestion, they settled into their designated convertibles with significant others, family, and—in Helio Castroneves’s case—buddies. Pleased, Ms. Judd? </p>

<p>At this time, I was running (read: trotting) to that Central Library location for a chance to interview the wives, girlfriends, and any possible boyfriends of the racers. Naturally, I missed it, but was told to stick around for the celebrities. Appearances were made by notables including rocker Eddie Money and Colts punter Pat McAfee. </p>

<p>The prop- <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2013/05/25/what-we-saw-500-festival-parade-take-2">and poop-filled</a> parade began at noon. Drivers waived. Fans yelled “Good luck tomorrow” to their favorites, who more often than not responded right back to them. Everyone in Indy is a polite Hoosier, at least on this day. </p>

<p>Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee, <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/best-of-indy/2012/12/27/profile-kickin-it-with-pat-mcafee">no stranger to controversy</a> and ever the huckster, even left his car at one point to <a href="https://twitter.com/IndyMonthly/status/338365645748072449" target="_blank">take a photo with a fan</a> sporting a shirt with McAfee's "Boomstick" moniker emblazoned on it.

"They hugged!" he exclaimed, faux-disappointed with a wink in his eye.</p>
<p>As he departed the Central Library steps for his ride, I said to Eddie Money, "Have fun today." He put his hand on my shoulder and said, "We will. It's what we're here for." His blonde wife, Laurie, looked on, amused as ever. They descended the steps and, with that, the parade was ready to go. Not quite "two tickets to paradise," but it'll do for now.</p>

It's exciting! It's &hellip; well, it's a real sausage fest.</p>
<p>Sure, there are female drivers. In fact, this year there are four: <a title="Simona" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1311337">Simona De Silvestro</a>, Ana Beatriz, Katherine Legge, and Pippa Mann. And yes, there are any number of smart, savvy women working the PR and administrative functions of the racing business. But lady pickings are slim among crewmembers, such as engineers and mechanics&mdash;and by "slim," I mean there is one: Anna Chatten. Indeed, it is believed that Chatten is the first and only female ever to work "over the wall" on a pit stop during the Indianapolis 500.</p>
<p>Chatten, who currently tends to Panther Racing's No. 4 car, piloted by <a title="JR" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2012/05/18/jr-hildebrand-rides-again">JR Hildebrand</a> and sponsored by the National Guard, developed a taste for motor racing at the tender age of 7, when her dad, a former motorcycle racer, bought a go-kart. Chatten recalls, "He drove me to the go-kart track, and I saw a bunch of little guys doing it, so I said, 'Hey, I want to give that a shot!'"</p>
<p>Chatten spent the next 11 years karting, but hung up her helmet when she turned 18. "My driving skills were definitely not next-level good," Chatten says with a laugh. Her mechanical skills, however&mdash;developed thanks to her father, who insisted she maintain her own kart&mdash;were. Chatten further honed those skills during high school, working in the machine shop at Caterpillar in her hometown of Peoria, IL. "My initial plan was to go to college and get an engineering degree and go to work at Caterpillar," Chatten says. "But I realized there was no way I was going to get up and to go the same place every day for the next 40 years of my life." Instead, Chatten skipped college and headed west, to Russell Racing School at Sears Point Raceway (now Sonoma Raceway), which offered a yearlong program for aspiring mechanics.</p>
<p>"It's pretty hard to get into this business, and it's even harder when you are me," Chatten says with a laugh. Meaning, of course, that some people seem to be bothered by the fact that Chatten has lady parts. Fortunately, however, contacts made at Sears Point helped Chatten land her first job, on an ALMS team. Since then, Chatten has worked in several series, including Barber Dodge Pro, Champ Car, Atlantics, and now, IndyCar. "It's definitely gotten easier&mdash;much easier&mdash;over the years," she notes. "It all starts with the person in charge. If they respect you, everybody else tends to fall in line with that."<img style="margin: 10px; float: right;" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/chatten2.JPG" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>So what, exactly, does Chatten do? During races, Chatten works the air jack&mdash;a pneumatic hose that plugs into the back of the car and helps to lift it off the ground so other crewmembers can change the tires. Needless to say, this job involves some level of physical risk, as Chatten herself discovered in 2010, when driver Mario Moraes ran over her foot at Mid-Ohio. The rest of the time, Chatten builds, sets up, and maintains the car's gearbox. "There's a lot of math involved in it, a lot of precise measuring," says Chatten. "I like that stuff."</p>
<p>When asked why there aren't more female mechanics, Chatten shrugs. "I have no good answer for that," she says. "There should be." One reason might be the difficulties involved in starting a family while working in racing&mdash;something Chatten, who is engaged to be married this fall, thinks about more and more. "It'd be pretty tricky," she acknowledges. "But the way I'm looking at it right now is that when I started in this business, everyone said I wouldn't make that work either. I figure there's only me, and I make the rules as I go."</p>

In a competition of communication skills, poise, academic performance, community and volunteer involvement, these young women&mdash;princesses for a time&mdash;are beyond beautiful smiles. Among more than 200 applicants, Allison Jacob was crowned this year's 500 Festival Queen at the Breakfast at the Brickyard on May 18.<br /><br />The three-month process whittled down those applicants to 32 princesses and a queen who serve as ambassadors of the 500 Festival and the Indianapolis 500. The young women selected represent 21 Indiana communities and nine Indiana colleges and universities.<br /><br />"Being a 500 Festival Princess was always a dream of mine since I was a little girl," says Jacob. "I vividly remember attending the 500 Festival Parade and pointing the float of princesses out to my mom. I would then ask her, 'Who are they?' and 'How come they are princesses?'"<br /><br />Those questions were answered when Jacob was not only crowned a princess, but later also a queen. Because of this, she was given a $2,500 educational scholarship for her junior year at Ball State University, where she studies public relations and communications. But to whom much is given much will be expected: Along with her scholarship and crown comes a list of activities to fill the next year.<br /><br />Among making <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2013/05/24/memorial-service-lends-gravity-to-500-festival">appearances throughout the week</a> leading up to the race, participating in the pre-race and victory circle celebrations, or representing the 500 Festival for a year, being royalty is sure to keep Jacob and the princesses busy.<br /><br />"I knew from the beginning that I was going to get out of it what I put into it," says Jacob. "Therefore I was going to give it my all. My eye was never set on the G. Thrapp Jewelers queen crown, but more importantly on getting everything I could out of the opportunity I was given."<br /><br /></p>

<p><em>&mdash;Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States, <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/reagan-0582.htm" target="_blank">on May 31, 1982</a></em></p>
<p><em></em><br /><strong>Indiana Gov. Mike Pence included that quotation </strong>among his remarks at the 500 Festival Memorial Service held today at noon on the steps of Monument Circle's Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Pence followed Indianapolis mayor <strong>Greg Ballard</strong>, himself a former Marine, and spoke solemnly and frankly about his standing before those assembled: "Unlike the mayor who just spoke, I am not a soldier. I am a soldier's son. ... I feel like the smallest man here."</p>
<p>About 2,000 onlookers attended as Pence, Ballard, and <strong>General Daniel B. Allyn</strong>&mdash;who earlier this month became the 20th commander of the U.S. Army Forces Command&mdash;addressed the fallen, surveyed the present, and glanced at the future. "I wonder how many times that scenario has played out&mdash;the last hug, the last kiss before heading off to war," said Mayor Ballard. "Sometimes, though, it really is the last war, the last kiss. And that is why we are here today."</p>
<p>"It is our duty to carry on despite the pain that never quite leaves." Ballard intoned those words on this day, but it was <strong>Autumn Letendre</strong> who personified them. Self-described as a singer, songwriter, mother, "and proud widow of <strong>Capt. Brian Letendre</strong>," who died in combat in Iraq in 2006, Letendre brought profound gravity to these proceedings, which included performances by the Capital City Chorus, Major Lisa Kopczynski, and the 38th Infantry Division Band, not even so much with her words (which were powerful) but by her very presence&mdash;and by the great honesty and weight of her quivering voice as she recounted two Marines arriving at her door in 2006 to relay word that her husband had given his life on duty. She described being married a decade ago not far from the monument's steps, and how she and Brian "spent less than 90 days together in three years." She also sang a few lines in the midst of her speech from a song she wrote and recorded, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPshGnrAhpw" target="_blank">"Raise Your Flag."</a></p>
<p><img class="image_align_top_right" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/2013/500-Memorial-Service-2013.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="454" />"The bitter lesson of history is that freedom comes with no guarantee," said Gen. Allyn among remarks considering the nation's history and its respect for those who have served. Bells tolled during this service as the names of 12 Hoosiers were read, names of those killed in the line of duty in the past year. In keeping with tradition, the presentation of the caisson included eight casket bearers and a riderless horse, called the Caparisoned Horse, marked by a set of cavalry boots and spurs placed backward in its stirrups with a U.S. Army saber affixed to its saddle. The symbolism was obvious; the 2,000 observers were completely quiet.</p>
<p>The first Memorial Day service was held on May 30, 1868, in Arlington National Cemetery, after the day was forever consecrated as such earlier that month. Also of note is that <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/2013/01/10/on-duty-a-sailors-story">the <em>USS Indianapolis</em> disaster</a> was mentioned in today's service; 317 men survived that tragedy.</p>
<p>"This is honestly the most memorable event that I will participate in, remembering Hoosiers who died for us," said <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2013/05/24/500-festival-queen-allison-jacob-begins-her-reign">500 Festival queen</a> <strong>Allison Jacob</strong>. "To escort the little boy [Gold Star child Austin Dan] to lay the wreath in place will be one of the most memorable parts of my reign."</p>
<p>Jacob says she will continue to reach out to children in Indiana schools and to hospitals during her year in service as the 500 Festival queen. She&mdash;and everyone else who witnessed today's service&mdash;is unlikely to forget the dedication and the ultimate sacrifices that make such efforts possible.</p>

<p>Speedway PD Lt.

Theobald is talking to? If you&rsquo;re guilty of pulling a keg (or one of those large Gatorade drinking jugs used by football teams) into the infield in a little red wagon, if your kid&rsquo;s birthday is in late February (nine months after May 24) and you have yet to identify the father, or if you simply can&rsquo;t remember your last Carb Day experience, then he&rsquo;s talking to you.</p>
<p>According to the 15-year veteran, patrol officers do not turn a blind eye to the <a title="Myrydd Wells" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2012/05/25/im-intern-has-first-carb-day-hilarity-ensues">shenanigans</a>.

Nevertheless, as you might expect, compared to the average patrol day &ldquo;there is a spike in <a title="Star" href="http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=BG&Dato=20130523&Kategori=THINGSTODO21&Lopenr=305230050&Ref=PH&gcheck=1?odyssey=mod%7Cskybox%7Cimg%7CIndyStar.com" target="_blank">crime</a> on Carb Day,&rdquo; says Lt.

Theobald&rsquo;s words of caution.)</p>

Also, excise police will be keeping a close eye on the youngsters. Under-21ers, no one really believes that plastic bottle of clear liquid you are chasing with Coke and juice is water.</p>
<p>If this little chat with the police is killing your buzz, try to look on the bright side. Our friend Lt. Theobald does. &ldquo;The weather shouldn&rsquo;t be too bad,&rdquo; he says.

But the estimated 400 <a title="photo gallery" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=139000">attendees</a>&mdash;including numerous IndyCar drivers and their significant others, as well as several Indy 500 notables&mdash;didn&rsquo;t seem to mind. The tunes only added to the pre-race party atmosphere. (<em>A list of some of the attendees appears below; click <a title="photo gallery" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photos.aspx?AlbumID=139000">here</a> for photos.</em>)</p>
<p>This year welcomed the inaugural <strong>Fashion in the Fast Lane</strong> event, hosted by the Indy Family Foundation. The show replaced the popular, long-running CARA Charities fashion soiree, previously held the Thursday before the Indianapolis 500. (CARA ceased operations earlier this year.)</p>
<p>Fashion in the Fast Lane&mdash;co-chaired by <a title="Boles and Daly" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1317830"><strong>Beth Boles</strong></a>, mother of IndyCar rookie and Noblesville native <a title="Boles and Daly" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1317830"><strong>Conor Daly</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1317822"><strong>Megan Krisiloff</strong></a>, vice president of IFF&rsquo;s board of directors&mdash;treated guests to small bites from Ritz Charles and mimosas and bloody marys courtesy of Fuzzy&rsquo;s Ultra Premium <a title="Fuzzy's" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2013/05/14/fuzzys-checkered-flag-bottle-off-to-fast-start">Vodka</a> and the northside <a title="Ruth's Chris" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/dining/articles/2011/12/28/supersize-meat">Ruth&rsquo;s Chris</a> Steak House. Many chose to purchase a multicolored &ldquo;blinky ring,&rdquo; which threw their name in the hat for one of four prizes, including a two-seater ride around the IMS and a $500 gift card to Kirles Jewelers.</p>
<p>Before the show, a &ldquo;glam squad&rdquo; of stylists from <a title="Bobby Cooper Salon" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/PhotoPages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=828662">Bobby Cooper Salon</a> and Makeup by Sparkle went to work on hair and cosmetics for drivers&rsquo; girlfriends and wives. The Broad Ripple boutique<strong> </strong><a title="8Fifteen" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/hoosierfeatures/2012/09/27/perfect-formula-pattern-paper">8Fifteen</a> provided the clothing.</p>
<p>Before the figurative checkered flag dropped, a live charity auction moved a Firestone tire autographed by all 33 Indy 500 starters, which netted $2,800, and a $4,800 pace-car ride for three with, as emcee <a title="Calabro" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/PhotoPages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=932589"><strong>Dave Calabro</strong></a> of WTHR called him, &ldquo;<a title="Andretti" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2012/05/18/vintner-mario-andretti-regales-guests-at-wine">Mario Freaking Andretti</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeds benefited the <strong>Indy Family Foundation</strong>, a locally based nonprofit that provides aid to needy families in the motorsports community.</p>

<p>Located on the corner of Main and 15th streets and facing Indianapolis Motor Speedway, <a title="Dawsons" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/dining/dish/2012/10/05/food-truck-big-rons-curbside-bistro">Dawson&rsquo;s on Main</a> fills with high-profile customers as race day draws near. The local favorite&mdash;known for its juicy tenderloin sandwich and cocktail sauce with a kick comparable to that of <a title="St Elmo" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/dining/dish/2012/05/14/st-elmo-wins-at-the-2012-james-beard-awards">St. Elmo&rsquo;s</a>&mdash;transforms into a see-and-be-seen eatery worthy of Beverly Hills. &ldquo;This time of year is so crazy,&rdquo; says former Dawson&rsquo;s server Justin Johnson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better money than what I made during Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 23-year-old waiter and bartender describes the Month of May in Dawson&rsquo;s as &ldquo;racecar drivers galore.&rdquo; He has seen appearances by Indy 500 notables such as IndyCar team owner <a title="Sarah Fisher" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1306030"><strong>Sarah Fisher</strong></a>, who holds the record for most starts among female drivers, and current NASCAR phenom <strong><a title="Danica" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/features/story.aspx?ID=1892011">Danica Patrick</a></strong>, who placed third in the 500 in 2009 (and who, of course, showcased her <a title="SI" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/swimsuit/video/0901.swimsuit.danica-patrick/model/danica_patrick/index.htm" target="_blank">enviable</a> body in two <em>Sports Illustrated</em> Swimsuit Editions). &ldquo;They both just stopped by like it was no big deal,&rdquo; says Johnson.</p>

<p><em></em>Still not impressed? Justin has served food to the legendary voice behind <em>Ladies and Gentlemen, Start Your Engines!</em>, Indianapolis Motor Speedway chairman <a title="IMS Class Photo" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=900945"><strong>Mari Hulman George</strong></a>, who is a Dawson&rsquo;s regular in May.&nbsp;Although she is a fantastic tipper and a tiny woman, Johnson confesses he had no idea who the 78-year-old customer was at first. &ldquo;She always wears sneakers, a t-shirt, and jeans,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Her hair is usually down, sometimes in a ball cap.&rdquo;<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/Dawson's%202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></p>

<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>How to Sing the National Anthem, by Sandi Patty</strong></p>
<p>1. Never try to make sense of the lyric.</p>
<p>2. Memorize it like you would a <a title="Stall" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/hoosierist/2012/03/29/fishy-source">license plate</a>.</p>
<p>3. Make sure you start on the right note. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re history.</p>
<p>4. Try to push out of your mind the wish that you were singing <em>God Bless America</em>.</p>
<p>5. If you make a mistake somewhere in the song, compensate by holding out your last three notes in long, dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>6. Save the <a title="Best Restaurants" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/editorsnote/2013/05/07/editors-note-may-2013">big meal</a> that you were planning until after the performance.</p>
<p>7. Act like you&rsquo;re having a good time.</p>
<p>8. Try to ignore the fact that the ballplayers standing in front of you have heard this song 100 times in the last four months. Don&rsquo;t take it personally when they yawn.</p>
<p>9. Pray.</p>
<p>10. Above all else, be proud. You are a citizen of the greatest country on earth.<br /><br /></p>

In 2012, Sun King donated $10,000 in product (wholesale price), and recently the company decided to add something a little different. They’re partnering with other like-minded Indiana businesses to create gift packs for various holidays and special events, starting with this weekend’s Indy 500. “We always try to include things from other local companies that we know and love, so it seemed like a no-brainer to put one together that people can take to the track,” says Robinson. </p>

To stay safe from the sun, the kit comes with a Sun King-branded trucker hat (or visor) along with a half-ounce silver tin of all-natural lip remedy from <strong><a href="http://ambreblends.com">Ambre Blends</a></strong> (<em>317-257-0202</em>). The lip balm has a gender-neutral flavor and natural SPF. The kits are $50 (valued at $80) and are available on a first-come, first-served basis at Sun King’s tasting room at 135 N. College Ave. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2013/05/21/track-survival-kits";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2013/05/21/track-survival-kits";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Tue, 21 May 2013 14:54:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Trisha Brand";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"A Hoosier Homecoming for One Snake Pit DJ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3444:"<p>Sharing the stage with the star DJs set to peform at IMS before the Indianapolis 500 this weekend is a face that might look familiar to some local race-goers: Indy native and &ldquo;house&rdquo; DJ Topher Jones.</p>
<p>Jones will play at the pre-race <a title="Snake Pit" href="http://www.indy500snakepit.com/" target="_blank">Snake Pit</a> party (now in its <a title="Benassi" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/2012/05/27/dj-benny-benassi-rocks-indy-500-snake-pit-par">second year</a>) alongside headlining DJs Diplo and Afrojack on May 26th starting at 7 a.m. in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway infield.</p>
<p>A loyal Hoosier, Jones, who now lives in Chicago, feels nostalgic about the chance to perform in his hometown for the race. &ldquo;I lived in Indy for 25 years and had never been to the actual race day,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for this weekend. Indianapolis is always home."</p>
<p>House music is a subgenre of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the 1980&rsquo;s&mdash;which is one of the reasons Jones made the move from Indy to the Windy City in 2010. Since the beginning of the year, Jones has been on the &ldquo;Hello North America&rdquo; tour, a clever reference to his hit &ldquo;Hello Chicago.&rdquo; It is his first branded tour. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing a lot of new markets that I&rsquo;ve never played before, and it&rsquo;s exciting,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hit a lot of angles of the United States that I&rsquo;ve never hit before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jones has been called a &ldquo;rising star&rdquo; and has produced hits such as &ldquo;Brohammer,&rdquo; which reached the top 10 on <a title="Beatport" href="http://www.beatport.com/#/artist/topher-jones/46765" target="_blank">Beatport</a>, an online music community for EDM artists. He has also received praise from renowned DJs such as Skrillex, Knife Party, and Tiesto.</p>
<p>Although European DJs are very prominent in house music, Jones is appreciative that the Heartland has made itself a hub for artists working in the genre. &ldquo;The Midwest has put out a lot of amazing musical talent,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty surprising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jones, for example, was living in Indianapolis when he got his first turntable as a 15 year old.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was really into hip-hop, and in the background of artists that I enjoyed they would always have DJs that would scratch records,&rdquo; Jones says. As he grew older, his taste switched from hip-hop to house music, which focuses more on sound selection and mixing rather than scratching records.</p>
<p>As much as he looks forward to returning to his old stomping grounds, Jones relishes sharing the bill with DJs the caliber of Diplo and Afrojack&mdash;and the chance to lay down a little something for his own fans as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its pretty special that my name is next to them, because those guys are two of the biggest house artists in the world right now,&rdquo; says Jones. &ldquo;I think that the highlight of everything is when you play your own tracks and they go over really well, and the audience knows them. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything cooler than that while playing a show.&rdquo;</p>

Or maybe they just want a glimpse of the newest member of Pagenaud&rsquo;s entourage: a 13-week-old Chow Chow named <strong>Hufflepuff</strong>.</p>
<p>Pagenaud, a <a title="2012 rookies" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/PhotoPages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=938387">driver</a> for Schmidt Peterson Motorsports, and <strong>his girlfriend, Hailey McDermott</strong> (pictured below), are fostering Hufflepuff at Indianapolis Motor Speedway this month. She&rsquo;s the fourth dog Pagenaud has fostered in partnership with the <a title="Debbie Paul" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/deborahpaul/story.aspx?ID=1631660"><strong>Humane Society of Indianapolis</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Pagenaud didn&rsquo;t name Hufflepuff but has started calling her HP for short. Coincidentally, the initials also refer to his car&rsquo;s primary sponsor, Hewlett-Packard.</p>
<p>With the exciting grounds of IMS to explore, HP is rarely left alone. While Pagenaud is on the track or in meetings, Hailey takes HP for walks, making frequent stops for pets and tummy rubs. At night, HP sleeps in Pagenaud&rsquo;s <a title="Haley" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=1311361">motorcoach</a>, an environment to which she&rsquo;s adapted well. The only disaster&mdash;so far&mdash;has been spilled coffee on Pagenaud&rsquo;s cellphone. And, like most puppies, HP does occasionally wake them up for 3 a.m. bathroom breaks. But overall, Pagenaud says, she&rsquo;s quite well behaved.</p>
<p>Fostering works out well for the driver, since his busy schedule makes it hard to own a dog longterm. But Pagenaud, who lives in Indianapolis, admits it can be tough giving the pooch up for adoption after he forges a bond. (The consolation: All three dogs he fostered before HP found their &ldquo;forever&rdquo; homes.) Despite the mild heartache, though, it&rsquo;s something he plans on continuing to do.</p>
<p>After all, who wouldn&rsquo;t want a fluffy, four-legged mascot?<br /><br /></p>

A gentleman from Anderson, Ind., posed in his garb of choice&mdash;not burlap and sandals but a "Praise the Lord" T-shirt and a headdress featuring the phrase "Jesus Is the Way." It was all devoted to his favorite team, <strong><a href="http://www.kingdomracing.net/" target="_blank">Kingdom Racing</a></strong>, and also to his maker, as it turns out.</p>
<p>It may seem at first a fluke or a flash in the pan, but Kingdom Racing is <a href="http://www.kingdomracing.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90&Itemid=84" target="_blank">a very real thing</a>.

Think of its workers as the Gideons of IndyCar, a nondenominational operation not hell- but rather heavenbent on fulfilling their mission, that being to share the gospel with as many folks as possible in motorsports, including some drivers, with testimonials on its website from a few of them.</p>

Girls, put down your mascara and pick up your pencils. In today&rsquo;s world, brains trump beauty. <em>But what about the pageants? </em>you wonder. For 500 Festival Princesses, the <a title="Olivia with princesses" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=942826">glamorous</a> ambassadors of racing&rsquo;s greatest spectacle, a pretty face is only a small part of the equation. Among the college-aged women who compete each year for the 33 coveted positions are future doctors, lawyers, and teachers.</p>
<p>Becoming a princess requires a solid resume. How solid? Oh, you know, just the typical stuff: Several internships, community leadership roles, school involvement, and an honors society membership. Just to name a few of the criteria. The 237 girls who didn&rsquo;t make the cut this year can attest to the difficulty of qualifying.</p>
<p>Some will be back to try again next year. That&rsquo;s what IUPUI journalism student <strong>Sydney Willmann</strong> did, before receiving her tiara this year. The 21-year-old senior is president of her sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha, heavily involved with student life, and juggling two internships. &ldquo;I decided to apply again because I love racing, and I didn&rsquo;t want to give up on something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for so long,&rdquo; says Willmann. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The competition is grueling. Each year, in late January, candidates face two interviews on the same day by separate judges, but only after filling out a lengthy online application, crunching out several essays, and sending in transcripts, references, and a photo (for identification purposes, Sydney says). After the January interviews, the girls wait nervously for results that same evening from the judges. Good news is given to 66 finalists, who are scheduled for a final interview in early February.</p>
<p>Once princesses, the girls attend IMS and Indy 500 events and travel Indiana for <a title="Ballard" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=942837">outreach</a> activities, visiting nursing homes, reading to elementary-school classes, and spending time with patients at Riley Hospital for Children. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve personally visited elementary schools, cooked breakfast at the Ronald Mcdonald House, done award assemblies, and much more,&rdquo; says Willmann.</p>
<p><em><img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px;" title="2013 500 Festival Princesses" src="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/Pics/Blogs/May%20Madness/2013%20group%20shot.jpg" alt="2013 500 Festival Princesses" width="336" height="217" /></em></p>
<p>And the contest isn&rsquo;t over when princesses are chosen. After an additional interview and public speaking competition, the 500 Festival <a title="Taylor Adams" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/PhotoPages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=938390">Queen</a> is announced at the annual Breakfast at the Brickyard event, held this Saturday on May 18 at 8:30 a.m. Sure, the $2,500 scholarship, G. Thrapp Jewelers crown, and exclusive honor is enough to make any college girl go coo coo, but for most candidates, the princess experience is rewarding enough. &ldquo;The ultimate goal of a 500 Festival Princess is not to be the <a title="Taylor Adams" href="http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/photopages/Photo.aspx?PhotoID=941831">Queen</a>,&rdquo; says Willmann. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to represent the 500 Festival and Indianapolis Motor Speedway in a positive light.&rdquo;</p>
