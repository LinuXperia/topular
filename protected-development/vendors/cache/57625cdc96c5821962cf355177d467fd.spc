<p><em>Maddy, obviously you&#8217;ve had a lot of experience in the fashion industry &#8211; everything from producing your own line to blogging and attending fashion shows. Tell us a little bit about your blazer line, Madison Maxey &#8211; what were some of your big takeaways? And, how did attending Parsons and your early career in fashion design lead you to your current projects in technology? </em></p>
<p>I started the blazer company when I was 18 and I was so in over my head. I had no idea what I was doing &#8211; but I learned and I grew as a person in ways I hadn&#8217;t previously imagined possible. Above all, I learned how to balance life and work and how to be self directed. I would recommended starting a business to anyone who wants an immense challenge and who wants to get to know themselves better.</p>
<p>Parsons is a fantastic school, but unfortunately was not a great fit for me. However, if I didn&#8217;t leave school, I never would have started my own business and it was truly entrepreneurship that brought me into the technology space. I realized that I would never be independent if I didn&#8217;t learn programming and even more so, I realized that technology is a fantastic industry that provides opportunities that fashion simply cannot.</p>
<p><em>How is your <a title="Thiel Fellowship" href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/" target="_blank">Thiel Fellowship</a> project&#8211;technology for manufacturers to ensure better fitting clothes&#8211;coming along? What have you learned so far? </em></p>
<p>The Thiel Fllowship project is making great progress and we&#8217;re excited to dig deeper into the research when I return to NY and can work with Mari in person. We&#8217;re currently keeping details of the project under wraps, but are looking for sponsorship for our research!</p>
<p><em>Your newest project, <a title="CRATED" href="http://thecrated.com/" target="_blank">CRATED</a>, sounds awesome! Tell us a little bit about how it came about and the team behind it. What are your plans for it?</em></p>
<p>CRATED is a multifaceted project, featuring a front facing digital content site for user engagement and a fashion and technology lab in order to lead innovation in the garment manufacturing process. We focus primarily on research in textile and pattern manipulation and are currently developing our pilot product- MELD. MELD is an B2B solution that aims to revolutionize the garment manufacturing process.</p>
<p><em>What would you consider to be your &#8220;big break?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think my big break was when I was 16 and started a fashion blog in France that took my co-founder and I to fashion shows and events in Berlin and Paris as press. This moment was absolutely pivotal as it made me realize that rules can be broken and that the sky is the limit if you&#8217;re willing to work hard and dream big. <b><br />
</b><br />
<em>Do you have any words of wisdom for young or recent entrepreneurs and designers out there, in fashion, tech, or fashion tech?<b> </b></em></p>
<p>I would say that anyone who aspires to make an impact must know that they are capable of absolutely anything. You can learn to program, learn about textiles, learn how to pitch to VCs &#8211; even learn smaller things like how to cook to souffle  - if you believe that you can and if you put the time and effort into it.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s a strategy or tactic that&#8217;s working really well for you right now? </em></p>
<p>Go forth with confidence. I&#8217;ve noticed that when ideas and plans are presented with a sense of confidence, everyone is more inspired &#8211; including yourself.</p>
<p><em>What is your guiding principle for design? </em></p>
<p>A touch of whimsicality is essential for every design I create. It&#8217;s important to me that there&#8217;s a bit of wonder in everything, whether that be a unique color palette or a surprising silhouette.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s next for you?<b> </b></em></p>
<p>I feel as though the future can be best described as adventuring into the land of rule breaking. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s next but it&#8217;s going to be something great and hopefully involve experimentation in textiles and patternmaking.</p>

<p><em>Mari, You have done some really great work with 3D printing. Why did you choose to work in this new medium? What have you learned about it? Why jewelry?</em></p>
<p>While putting together the inspiration for the Kimberly Ovitz Fall 2013 season, we were drawing a lot of inspiration from “natural defense mechanisms”. This meant poisonous frogs, microscale views of venom, and exoskeletons. Seeing as the inspiration for the collection was nature, it was almost uncomfortable to not attempt a “zero waste” approach. 3d printing was the obvious choice and had been on my radar for some time. <b></b></p>
<p>I have since learned that 3d printing is still in its infancy, despite all of the hype- there is so much further to go! The list of printable materials is expanding rapidly, and the possibilities for consumer engagement through customization are endless.</p>
<p><em>Did you work with <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com/" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>? What was that like? How did you choose your partners?</em></p>
<p>Shapeways was our collaborator in this particular jewelry collection. They are extremely accommodating and easy to work with. Through their forums- designers and 3d modellers can connect to work on projects together. This way, a designer at any skill level is able to hire a modeller to execute their design. For our collaboration we worked with an very talented architect Kostika Spaho, who has received a great deal of press through his early collaborations in 3d printed shoes.</p>
<p><em>How does your interest in fashion tech play into your role at Kimberly Ovitz, and/or past ones at Helmut Lang, Alvin Valley, and Chado Ralph Rucci?</em></p>
<p>Well, this is interesting as I would say that my interest in innovation is reactionary to what I experienced in contemporary garment manufacturing. There are so many possibilities for automation in the fashion industry that have not at all been explored, which would not only allow for designers to concentrate more on designing, but increase the efficiency in the concept to landing products as well as generate humane factory working conditions.</p>
<p><em>What would you consider to be your &#8220;big break?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Oddly enough, I think this would be my early experience working as an assistant perfumer to Christoper Brosius of “CB I hate perfume”. Christopher was a great influence on my life, as his passion was to create “experiential perfumes”. This meant tapping into the most primal sense we have as humans: the olfactory bulb, which can evoke the most visceral memories. I learned through this experience the importance of a product feeling personal and the intimacy of customization which is the big picture trajectory of CRATED.</p>
<p><em>What excites you about working at the intersection of fashion and technology?</em></p>
<p>EVERYTHING. Ahem. Though truthfully, it is the confluence of my greatest passions merged into one. There is a tendency to assume that caring about the way that you look is materialistic, though we all wear clothes and make these daily aesthetic decisions. Why is it that we are not using this medium to communicate our specific ideologies as well as diversity through customization?</p>
<p><em>What does the future of your field look like?</em></p>
<p><i>I</i> would hope that we can begin to confront the issues of image vs. reality. This pertains to brand vanity sizing, photoshopping to unrealistic ideals of beauty etc. We should also be striving for sustainably produced longer lasting products with attainable price points.</p>
<p><em>What is your guiding principle for design?</em></p>
<p>Is it timeless? Is it inclusionary? Does it contribute to the dialogue of culture?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Technology Entrepreneurs Prove That Customer Insights Drive Results</h2>
<p>Two co-founders pitched their growing startups on the Verge stage, and neither of them would have much to talk about if it weren&#8217;t for the market traction they gained after leveraging market insights they gleaned from close relationships with their customers.</p>
<h2>BoxFox&#8217;s Chris Palmer Makes a Major Breakthrough Based on Customer Insights</h2>
<p>Chris Palmer pitched BoxFox. It was only through the experience of testing his market hypothesis with SupplyKick that Chris was able to identify and pursue the business model that has now taken the front seat, BoxFox. After doing some market research, Chris found some rather striking statistics.</p>
<p>“99 percent of US retailers have four or less locations,” he said on the Verge stage. “That makes up over 700,000 retailers in the US that collectively have over $6 billion dollars of excess merchandise every year that they have no good way of liquidating.”</p>
<p>Without understanding the nature of his customer&#8217;s problems, Chris would never have developed the market knowledge to offer his solution to a bigger market problem. Getting out and validating your learning through making sales is the fastest way to determine the best direction for your startup.</p>
<h2>Lesson.ly&#8217;s Max Yoder Solves Customer&#8217;s Problems Better Than the Big Guys</h2>
<p>Max Yoder pitched Lesson.ly. Max and his team identified the problem Lesson.ly aims to solve through first-hand experience managing companies. In other words, their first tier of market research was their cumulative direct encounters with the business problem they solve. After some market research, Max was able to sharpen the Lesson.ly market hypothesis to address specific pain points around cost, ease of use, and effectiveness.</p>

<p>As we gear up for this year’s <a title="The Innovation Showcase" href="http://theinnovationshowcase.com/" target="_blank">Innovation Showcase</a>&#8211;which is coming up this Thursday&#8211;we’re taking a look at some of those companies that will be pitching and the creative solutions they’re providing to practical business problems.</p>
<p>Our first pitch for June’s Verge event came from Chris Palmer, founder and CEO of <a title="BoxFox" href="http://www.boxfox.co/" target="_blank">BoxFox</a>, an online B2B marketplace for small retailers to appraise and sell excess merchandise to authorized resellers.</p>
<p>BoxFox grew out of Chris’ first venture, SupplyKick. Chris has a friend who owns a retail clothing store here in Indy. Last fall, this friend ended up having to give away over $4,000 worth of great inventory because he just couldn’t sell it. Furthermore, his vendors were very strict about where and how he could sell their merchandise, so putting it on a site such as eBay wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>Chris began to wonder how many other retailers have this problem. After all, large retailers have online stores where they could move their excess inventory, how do small retailers cope with this issue?</p>
<p>After doing some market research, Chris found some rather striking statistics. “99 percent of US retailers have four or less locations,” he said on the Verge stage. “That makes up over 700,000 retailers in the US that collectively have over $6 billion dollars of excess merchandise every year that they have no good way of liquidating.”</p>
<p>And so SupplyKick was born.</p>
<p>SupplyKick has been successfully buying and selling small retailers products in the Indianapolis area over the past year. Currently in their first year, SupplyKick has already achieved over half a million dollars in revenue. BoxFox aims to scale what works well with SupplyKick in Indianapolis to the national marketplace.</p>
<p>BoxFox is designed to allow small businesses to get a real time appraisal of their merchandise and quickly and easily liquidate it to other businesses. All retailers have to do is scan their merchandise, get an appraisal, and send it off. It’s both easy and safe, with their system acting as a double blind transaction, masking both the buyer’s and seller’s identity.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for Chris and the BoxFox team. They were invited to Silicon Valley as a finalist for the next class at <a title="Y Combinator" href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a>, one of the country&#8217;s most prestigious accelerators  a few months ago. Though they did not secure a spot at Y Combinator, BoxFox was able to secure funding from <a title="Start-up Chile" href="http://startupchile.org/" target="_blank">Start-Up Chile</a>, a globally recognized startup incubator. As Chris gears up for the Innovation Showcase, he is looking for retailers who are willing to give some feedback on their product, a lead Ruby on Rails or Python developer, and potential investors.</p>
<p>I was able to sit down with Chris a few weeks ago and discuss his lessons learned from the Y Combinator and Start-Up Chile experience. Here are  few key pieces of advice for startups applying for well-regarded accelerator programs.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">When you get the invitation to come pitch, usually two or so weeks before the pitch date, book your travel plans immediately&#8211;then clear you schedule until then. It&#8217;s worth setting your ongoing activities aside to ensure you make the most out of the chance to catapult your company to the next level. </span></li>
<li>Before you pitch, find existing companies that have worked with your accelerator and reach out to them for input on your business. Chris flew out two days before pitching at Y Combinator and met with a company at their headquarters in California. The advice and strategies he gleaned from them had a big impact on how he pitched BoxFox to the YC team.</li>
<li>The accelerators need to hear that your company is going to reach massive scale. When it comes to your projections, &#8220;They&#8217;re looking for a B, as in billion, not an M,&#8221; said Chris.</li>
<li>Be brief in your responses on the application itself. Most applications will have a video segment anyway, and the individuals reviewing your application probably don&#8217;t have more than five minutes for it. They are, after all, reviewing thousands&#8211;so do your best to be short, sweet, and memorable.</li>
<li>Make sure you are able to demo your product or application at the pitch. They want to <em>see</em> and interact with it&#8211;not hear about it.</li>
<li>When given the choice to either know your market or build your product, you absolutely must know your market. Understand your competitors and exactly how you are differentiated from them&#8211;and why your customers need <em>you</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll be able to learn more about Chris, BoxFox, and 59 other innovative Indy startups at the 2013 Innovation Showcase. Be sure to <a title="The Innovation Showcase" href="http://theinnovationshowcase.com/" target="_blank">grab your tickets</a> and I&#8217;ll see you there!</p>

<p><b><a href="http://vergestartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tim-Jahn.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1825" alt="Tim Jahn" src="http://vergestartups.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tim-Jahn.jpg" width="140" height="140" /></a>1. Made-Up Titles</b><br />
I can&#8217;t wait to see terms like &#8220;growth hacker&#8221; go away because they don&#8217;t make any sense. A &#8220;growth hacker&#8221; is simply a data/analytics person, a role that has been around for years and years. Startup folks love to make up new titles for decades-old roles every few years.<br />

<p>I&#8217;ll admit that when we changed our logo to the lobster font over a year ago, I loved it. We hired a designer on 99designs for a new logo. The whole team loved it. We trashed the fancy logos.</p>
<p>Now, I see lobster font everywhere, both in print and online. It seems like every new startup is putting its logo in lobster. It&#8217;s practically a startup meme. In fact, we made a website<br />
(http://f***yeahlobster.tumblr.com/) &#8212; replace the ***&#8211; to track the deployment of lobster font around the Internet and Bay Area!</p>

<p>Launch parties make you a joke in my book. I&#8217;m not talking about launch events, like conferences or even self-hosted events to attract your target market to your company as part of a launch strategy. I&#8217;m talking about parties that celebrate a company launching its product. Seriously? You couldn&#8217;t find something smarter to do than burn up a cash bar? I never root against entrepreneurs but, if I started, these are the ones I&#8217;d pick first.<br />

Unremarkable &#8220;Pivots&#8221;</b></p>
<p>A startup &#8220;pivot,&#8221; popularized by Eric Ries and the Lean Startup model, has many meanings. Most frequently, a &#8220;pivot&#8221; is a change in your business model, a strategic move that a company makes after lots of experimentation and customer feedback.</p>
<p>Many companies seem to use the term as a badge of honor: &#8220;Yes, we have tested and listened to customers! We&#8217;re a lean startup!&#8221; Too often, however, the company has only made a small shift in a small part of the business. Changing an email template is not a pivot. Nor is rearranging a customer service flow. Change your business, then own your pivot!</p>

<p>I am a proponent of entrepreneurs sharing ideas and bouncing ideas off each other. I&#8217;m not a fan of mastermind groups that charge a $20,000 entry fee and appear to be more about ego than real idea-sharing. I&#8217;ve seen a trend lately of entrepreneurs talking about what mastermind groups they are in before they discuss which companies they work on. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a positive trend.<br />

<p>&#8220;So, do you have an app?&#8221; is always one of the top three questions off the bat at any &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; or &#8220;startup&#8221; networking event. The minute it becomes apparent that I have nothing to do with apps (and that I happen to be tech illiterate!), it&#8217;s as if I told the Mean Girls to add me to the Burn Book. The last time I checked, the $10 million consumers spent on &#8216;ZinePaks in 2012 outweighed the 10,000 people who downloaded your app in the last year. Don&#8217;t be so quick to discount something that doesn&#8217;t come from the App Store.<br />

The Belief that the Amount of Money Raised is Equal to How Successful You Are</b></p>
<p>As an entrepreneur at business school, the first question my classmates always ask is &#8220;how much have you raised!?&#8221; as if success is tied to funding amount. \I hope people quickly realize that raising a lot of money doesn&#8217;t equal success, rather, that success should be judged by an amazing product, market demand, a strong brand and a great team.<br />

<p>The trend of establishing a BYOD (bring your own device) policy at a business should probably just go away. It&#8217;s debatable whether it makes employees more productive, and it can cause plenty of security issues. You also run the risk of overloading your IT department, as well as alienating older staff members who may not want to buy a mobile device just to comply with the policy.<br />

<p>Plenty of startups are founded with the goal of a short-term exit. I&#8217;m not necessarily against looking for exit opportunities for a new company, but if that&#8217;s your only plan &#8212; starting a new company, just to sell it off within a few months or a year &#8212; you&#8217;re doing it wrong. Even assuming that you can be sure you&#8217;re building something that another company will want to purchase, the attitude that you&#8217;re not in it for the long haul can make it hard to create a quality company worth selling.<br />

<p><b>10. Mashup Descriptions</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see people stop describing their startups in terms of other companies. I cringe when I hear things like &#8220;It&#8217;s Yelp meets LinkedIn, with a twist of Airbnb running cloud-based apps on AWS.&#8221; Find a simple way to describe what you do, nicely and elegantly. Latching on to successful companies is not a recipe for success, and it&#8217;s more likely to confuse people.<br />

<p>One pitch from our June event came from <a title="Max Yoder" href="https://twitter.com/MaxYoder" target="_blank">Max Yoder</a>, Founder and General Manager of <a title="Lesson.ly" href="http://www.lesson.ly" target="_blank">Lesson.ly</a>.  Lesson.ly is a corporate education tool used primarily for employee and client onboarding.  My own company, <a title="Biz Props" href="http://www.bizprops.com/" target="_blank">BizProps</a>, actually just started using Lesson.ly and the tool is great. And if you spend 30 seconds talking to Max, you’ll instantly see his passion for helping educate others in this space.</p>
<p>Max and his team noticed a problem.  Growing companies are spending too much time, money, and effort getting their primary stakeholders up to speed and keeping them there.  As they started to research solutions, they found that there is a perception in the market that the current learning solutions are either too inefficient, too expensive, or both.  Max found that most of those learning solutions were built in an offline world and had to be translated to an online world.  Some solutions transitioned very well, but they tended to price small businesses out of their solution.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Max and his team came up with a simple premise: “If we can make it easy and affordable for companies to build, distribute, and measure the effectiveness of their learning materials, we can do something really special.”</p>
<p>With that, they built what they call “The simplest way for businesses to teach and learn.”</p>
<p>Lesson.ly is built to be simple to use. The product experience can be boiled down into three steps:</p>
<p>-Build</p>
<p>-Distribute</p>
<p>-Measure</p>
<p>There is beauty in this simplicity. Lesson.ly&#8217;s goal was to do three things and do them very well.  Everything is built to be intuitive.  The authoring tool is so easy that, in Max’s words, “If you can type, you can teach.”  You can easily assign lessons that are automatically distributed to learners and have report cards automatically sent back to you.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves.  In their first five months, Lesson.ly has acquired 2,000 learners across a multitude of clients.  A big part of that success has to be credited to the simplicity that Max and his team embraced.  When asked about what made his product different from other LMS services, Max responded, &#8220;We’re trying to build a really refined application.  We don’t want to follow the example that the existing LMS space has set, with calendaring systems and a bunch of different features that users may or may not even think are important.  The benefit of Lesson.ly is that we have a really refined application, we can offer a low price point, and we can scale to your needs. That’s something that I think is very important.  I’m not about to go follow somebody else’s lead.”</p>
<p>That’s something that I think all entrepreneurs can learn from.  Understand your product&#8217;s key value prop and pursue that ruthlessly.  Breaking from the herd isn’t a bad thing; in the case of Lesson.ly, it’s a differentiator.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to learn more about Max, Lesson.ly, and 59 other innovative Indy startups at the 2013 Innovation Showcase.  Click <a title="here" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5516632396" target="_blank">here</a> to register and we’ll see you there!</p>

<p><strong>We&#8217;re thrilled to announce the next group of Innovators to watch:</strong></p>
<p><strong>ShopTalk </strong>was founded in September 2012 to solve the most talked about pain point for online retailers today – how to best capitalize and engage potential customers through Facebook. ShopTalk’s subscription-based product gives retailers exposure to their customers’ social network by providing shoppers an instant discount (or other direct incentives) for sharing their purchases to Facebook, while also providing retailers analytics behind customer profiling and the reach/interaction of posted products.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative Photonics Technologies, LLC</strong> Increases the performance of electronics systems used in communications and computing networks by miniaturizing current fiber optic architectures onto photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Development work has included fiber-optic architectures for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADC / DAC), photonic switching, and optical processing of multiple simultaneous radio frequency (RF) communications and radar signals for antenna arrays. The first product InPhoTec is bringing to market is a high-speed and high-resolution all-optical ADC based on an architecture developed by Dr. Siahmakoun that takes advantage of the reduced path lengths and high-speed devices available in photonics chips to achieve market leading performance. Currently raising funds to complete implementation of this photonic ADC.</p>
<p><strong>DermaLife, LLC </strong>provides advanced skin care solutions. Since our company&#8217;s founding in early 2010, we have focused on launching in the U.S. an improved formulation of a classic French remedy that generates $50M in annual revenues and is used in over 70% of French households for burns, wounds anti-aging. Since Dermal Life achieved FDA clearance on May 1, 2013 and recently launched LaFONTAINE to achieve revenue generation, we are pursuing both strategic private-label partnerships and strategic angel-investor funding of up to $1 million to launch Rx indications into radiation oncology and dermatology market segments.</p>
<p><strong>Infinite AI, Inc.</strong> builds intelligent end-to-end automation systems for supply chain operations and healthcare organizations that utilize artificial intelligence, robotics, RFID and high performance computing.</p>
<p><strong>MYTM8</strong> is a management tool for youth sports teams that simplifies the lives of parents and coaches. The application was developed to alleviate the day-to-day management and fundraising challenges uncovered by conversations with local sports teams. In the past several months, we have built and beta tested a functional team management application. MYTM8 is currently expanding our user network and engaging the feedback of our existing member teams.  To build upon this success, MYTM8 is working to enhance the fundraising potential of youth teams &#8211; enabling team parents to give back to their organization through everyday purchases on their smartphone. Within the past few weeks, we have developed a relationship with the state&#8217;s governing soccer body, the Indiana Soccer Association, to eventually test and promote our fundraising application to their member base of 60,000 players.</p>
<p><strong>Envigilator</strong> We solve the problem that teachers don&#8217;t have any insights into the methodology or steps their students use in completing assignments by recording data and syncing it to the cloud for further analytics and review. You might remember us from the Innovation Showcase last year. At that time, we were capturing data for the purposes of cheating prevention. We&#8217;ve learned that there isn&#8217;t much of a market for cheating prevention software. However, our users loved using our recordings to help students who struggled in their classes. So we listened and now we&#8217;re working on building Envigilator into a complete assignment level learning analytics system to help students and teachers discover and correct the difficult points in the learning process. Do you know educators that give computer-based assignments? It could be coding exams, graphic design, or even english or history papers written on a computer. We&#8217;d love to talk to them!</p>
<p><strong>Curvo Labs, LLC </strong>Hospitals and surgery centers purchase $200 billion in medical devices each year. Medical device companies spend more to sell a product than to manufacture it. Hospitals and surgery centers need to save money. Medical device companies need to sell products efficiently. With Curvo, they both win.</p>
<p><strong>MedDiary.com </strong>solves the challenge of remotely managing patients with multiple chronic conditions by enabling healthcare providers to truly &#8220;prescribe&#8221; a personalized health management plan directly to their patient&#8217;s mobile device. The idea for MedDiary.com originated when the Founder of the company was diagnosed with a second chronic condition, after having launched an app (MyGiTrack) specific to his first chronic condition (Crohn’s disease). The Founder didn’t want to use two different apps to manage his health. The MedDiary.com health management platform has evolved into an enterprise-level SaaS-based system, supporting population management and care coordination for patients with multiple chronic conditions. The MedDiary.com system will soon receive approval from Allscripts to integrate into their Enterprise EHR system. We are now pursuing partnerships with regional hospital groups for clinical evaluations.</p>
<p><strong>Bookacoach</strong> For decades, the $6B sports coaching market has operated on an archaic and unsafe process of finding, booking and buying private instruction. The complexity of managing private lessons for one athlete involves the use of yard signs, word of mouth, cash/check, and lengthy email exchanges. With more than 700K active coaches and 40M athletes ages 6 to 18 participating in sports instruction in the US, growth is expected to exceed $7B by 2017. bookacoach is an online mobile responsive web app platform that offers a simple and robust solution to the complexities of managing private lesson instruction for both coaches and parents. Coaches receive their BAC Safety Certification thru our exclusive background check API, offering parents peace of mind while booking. Upon launch, we were the featured trending story on mashable.com and since then have taken bookacoach to over 600 coaches in 33 states and 200 cities. This number continues to grow at a 50+ % growth month over month.</p>
<p><strong>Courseload,</strong> the leading innovator in the aggregation, delivery and use of digital course materials in higher education, helps institutions increase student access to course materials, improve affordability and enhance learning outcomes. Courseload eliminates the barriers that have impeded the print-to-digital evolution in academia through a business model inclusive of all stakeholders, an innovative platform incorporating study tools and analytics to enhance learning and pedagogy and a team with deep experience in implementing educational technology solutions. Most recently, Courseload was identified as the leading contributor to a 12.5 percent increase in student retention at one of our partner institutions, Berkeley College. In addition, the IMS Global Learning Consortium recently awarded Courseload and its partner, Indiana University, with a Gold Learning Impact Award. Courseload has also been identified as an Indiana Company to Watch and Best Place to Work (2012,2013).</p>
<p><strong>7PSolutions, LLC</strong>  delivers one comprehensive GPS-GSM monitoring solution to the pharmaceutical, biotech and life science industries for the transportation of climate control cargo, with integrated security and quality management. This technology is also being recognized by high-value and time definite manufacturers and service providers. Our company was founded in 2010 to fulfill an unmet need in the life sciences and transportation industries. Our management team consists of logistics, quality assurance and operations veterans who have cold chain and pharma experience. Our current clients include small and medium sized trucking companies, manufacturers of climate controlled cargo carriers, cargo airlines and major couriers. We are currently expanding our product offerings to include telematics fleet management for small vehicles, and enhancing our software to provide greater visibility to our clients of their location and environmental data.</p>
<p><strong>Sapphire Education, LLC</strong> is using analytics and social collaboration to improve student academic performance. By allowing students to forecast their grades and share their academic knowledge with one another, we intend to use social metrics to enhance learning. We have seven confirmed high schools and colleges ready to beta test our software in the fall. Currently we are working on an algorithm that screens the web for relevant education content.</p>
<p><strong>IN3</strong> is a digital products company in West Lafayette that focuses on developing paperless solutions. These solutions include a note taking tool for conferences and classrooms named paperlessMe; survey tools; mobile documents; and directory applications.</p>
<p>Wasatch Photonics Wasatch Photonics is developing an imaging device using Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT)that will provide new information and evidence to physicians to aid diagnoses and treatment of vascular disorders. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major complication of diabetes – about 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease and stroke. Our product development is driven by trends in medical care requiring higher value physician patient interactions along with the growth trend of vascular disorders mirroring diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Wasatch Photonics</strong> (WP) was founded in 2002 in Logan, Utah to build volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings initially for the telecom industry. In 2010 Wasatch Photonics expanded into optical systems with the acquisition of Kiara Biosystems. This systems division has been focused on optical systems for Raman spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography. In the OCT space we have sold systems to researchers and OEM’s.</p>
<p><strong>Evacua</strong> is using the ride-sharing business model to create an evacuation marketplace during emergencies of all kinds. Members can get out before a hurricane strikes, or even avoid missing that important meeting when their commercial flight gets cancelled. Resource sharing during these scenarios can lead to exponential savings, and improved efficiency. We have already secured sponsorship of the Global Congress of Travel Risk Management, and have been mentioned in articles surrounding travel startups on Tnooz and Skift.</p>
<p><strong>SpeechVive</strong> enables people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease to speak louder and communicate more effectively through a spontaneous reflex (the Lombard effect). Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system which affects over 1.5 million people in the U.S.<br />
90% of people with Parkinson&#8217;s (PWP) have hypokinetic dysarthria and cannot speak loud enough to be heard. SpeechVive has 4 years of clinical data which demonstrates the ability of the SpeechVive device to revive the patients voice immediately in over 75% of cases. Another 15% show significant improvement after wearing the device for 8 weeks. One patient recently commented, &#8220;I am tired of people talking over me as if I didn&#8217;t exist.&#8221; She is excited to try SpeechVive as soon as it is commercially available along with thousands of other PWP.</p>
<p><strong>Animated Dynamics&#8217;</strong> Biodynamic Imaging platform is a breakthrough biomedical technology that is like putting vital signs monitors inside living tissue to measure its health and how it responds to drugs&#8230;simply by shining light on it. It has applications for the selection of personalized cancer therapies, the discovery of new drugs and improving the efficiency of in-vitro fertilization.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Auto Dealer Solutions, Inc.</strong> has created a Cloud-based Dealer Management System that supports the entire Dealership Lifecycle. Both New and Independent Dealers can now benefit from Internet Technology that doesn&#8217;t require additional sotware products to run on tablets or cell phones &#8211; our products already run on them because they were built from scratch on state of the art technology. Needless rekeying of data between business units and business partners is eliminated. With crisp designs and similar screen layouts, the front and back office adoption is quick and easy. We provide CRM, Inventory, Desking, Finance and Insurance, Service, Parts, and Integrated Accounting and E-Mail. New technology allows dealerships to reduce costs, time, and errors and provides real time reporting for both Sales and Service. We have joined forces with key automotive and financial companies to create a true Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) package that also improves upon current DMS products.</p>
<p><strong>Enfront.com</strong> empowers small business owners and field sales personnel to deliver person-to-person communication to the individuals and small groups important to success, for either relationship building or revenue building. Our software platform is online, putting custom content and actionable contact &#8220;at your fingertips.&#8221; Output media includes postcards, email, letters, and 3-dimensional mail. All production is handled behind the scenes by Enfront partners. Delivery can be immediate or at pre-defined future intervals. Enfront has established accounts coast-to-coast via independent Consultant Partners and headquarters sales to National Accounts. Our multi-media capability is providing an increasingly sought-after alternative to email only marketing, and Enfront is pursuing production partnerships with email players such as Indy&#8217;s Weblink International. We believe that e-glut and related marketplace noise represent an enormous opportunity, and we are positioned ideally.</p>
<p><strong>BoxFox</strong> helps small brick-and-mortar retailers appraise and liquidate their excess merchandise via its B2B marketplace. Retailers can automatically determine their inventory value through proprietary web-based software and then sell it to authorized resellers. BoxFox charges resellers a tiered subscription fee and takes a small transaction fee from both parties.</p>
<p><strong>PeeqMe</strong> For employees working in the &#8216;people economy,&#8217; dizzying levels of value-destroying disengagement exist because people often feel misunderstood, misused and abused. How people work matters. PeeqMe socializes the personality, behavior and talent assessments that over 100 million people have taken with the right level of intimacy and simplicity to be useful. When people understand their style and their teammates&#8217;, when they use their strength and not weakness, and when they get positive not negative feedback, people do better together. By applying the smartest science, best practices, and social trends, PeeqMe allows professionals to know themselves, show their best, and grow with crowd-sourced, positive feedback. PeeqMe launched beta in June on iTunes for our high-potential, early adopting members. We are signing up small enterprise clients to pilot in higher ed, non-profit, professional services, and high tech. PeeqMe is developing enterprise functionality for a 2014 launch.</p>
<p><strong>CloudOne</strong> Driving our business (and the cloud in general) is the dissatisfaction with the old ways of information technology: buy the hardware and software up front, pay to have it installed and configured, and then make expensive maintenance payments year after year that offer few new features or updates. Organizations were stuck with whatever they owned, even as their needs evolved. We’re using our unique capabilities to address this issue: 1. It’s economical, because organizations pay only for what they use, and we operate their software in the most expert and efficient way. 2. It’s elastic, because it grows and shrinks with changing business cycles. 3. It’s global, because everyone involved can connect from anywhere, anytime: sharing data, processes and knowledge with each other. Everything about business has become on-demand: utilities, facilities, staffing – and now we’re helping customers in all industries make the move to dynamic IT.</p>
<p><strong>3DLT.com</strong> There are 200,000 3D printers currently around the world, and that number is growing fast. With a growing number of printers, there will be a growing number of 3d printable content. 3DLT.com is the Istockphoto of 3D printable designs. We provide makers the content to do much more with their 3D printers. Recent successes include TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield Finalist/Alum, SXSW V2V Venture Finalist, X-Lab Winner.</p>
<p><strong>AlGalCo, LLC</strong> has the exclusive license from Purdue University to commercialize a new technology in which hydrogen is generated on demand simply by adding water to a solid alloy comprised of 90% common aluminum. The deployment of hydrogen reduces the demand for oil as it replaces gasoline and diesel when powering any internal combustion engine or fuel cell. When hydrogen is combusted, it burns with zero harmful emissions, only water vapor. Since our feedstock is aluminum, it can be recycled indefinitely. AlGalCo is currently involved in numerous applications both commercial and for the military. Weekly, we invite all interested parties to visit our beta test site located at the city of Carmel Street Department garage. We operate a standard F 250 pick-up truck partially on our hydrogen. The results are a 15% increase in mileage and a reduction in harmful emissions. Testing for Revision 2.0 of our hydrogen on demand system is also demonstrated on the test vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Tymora Analytical Operations, LLC</strong> has been established to provide new research products and reagents to Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations within the life sciences market. Tymora has developed a set of highly effective technologies for the analysis of protein phosphorylation that relates to the onset of numerous diseases, most notably cancer. Tymora’s flagship products, PolyMAC and pIMAGO, greatly enhance an organization’s ability to discover and develop new therapies that combat disease.</p>
<p>As you can see, this is going to be an action-packed Showcase. I hope to see you there!</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s one thing you learned from raising funding that you wish you&#8217;d known BEFORE you started?</h2>

I run a service-based company and see lots of great products come through our door. When I finally had &#8220;my idea&#8221; for a product, I took it to two or three investors. The product was solid. We quickly built the tech and started spending marketing dollars.</p>
<p>I learned I should have lined up my buyers. We needed big advertising partners, and I didn&#8217;t have them lined up. If I did it again, I would have commitments from &#8220;buyers&#8221; who, if we hit X, would get on board. Validate the concept with real customers and real contracts.</p>

<p>Most startups fail. Raising funds from others is a serious commitment, and it will keep you up at night when things aren&#8217;t going well. See what you can do on a limited budget and raise in milestone increments. If you can bootstrap, do it. Luckily, entrepreneurs can now use crowdfunding sites like Fundable (http://www.fundable.com) to raise capital by preselling their products or services and providing something of value in exchange to their backers quickly. This allows you to reduce the risk for yourself and the investors by first validating market demand.<br />

<p>I&#8217;ve now seen about 500 pitches live. I&#8217;ve given that many just in two years as a founder, some to investors and some to the market/community. What&#8217;s become abundantly clear is that 95 percent of us are actually talking about building businesses that take 10 seconds to explain. However, we keep thinking 15 minutes or a great story will make those 10 seconds more interesting. Just say what you are. Then, say where you are now and where you&#8217;re going. Then, if you don&#8217;t have any questions from an investor, ask him for feedback on something that&#8217;s bothering you. Rinse and repeat.<br />

<p>Many entrepreneurs discuss fundraising as a &#8220;full-time&#8221; job and recommend that you give up your day-to-day responsibilities for the 6 weeks (or 3 months!) it will take to close the round. That sounds amazing, but I do not believe it&#8217;s possible, at least not for a seed or &#8220;A&#8221; round.<br />
The drivers of a startup are its people. As a founder, you cannot afford to disappear for a few months. You should prep your team before you begin fundraising. Be prepared to work twice as hard during the fundraising process. Your investors need you, but so do your customers and team.<br />

<p>One thing many entrepreneurs fail to understand is that if you raise too much money, it could easily lead to overspending. The adept entrepreneur will set a specific number for how much money he or she needs to start a business. Fundraising initiatives should be scaled back significantly (if not halted) once that goal is reached.<br />

Master Capital Efficiency</b></p>
<p>More isn’t better when it comes to raising money. What you do with your money is what determines your future success &#8212; not how much you get. Capital efficiency is a better indicator of your startup’s success than capital access. Large amounts of capital result in unnecessary dilution at a lower valuation. With smaller funds, you can preserve ownership, scale at a steady pace and set more manageable milestones.<br />

<p>Term sheets are where you really find out the investor&#8217;s intentions. Look out for exit clauses. If they are not clearly defined, ask for them to be.</p>
<p>Term sheets can be very carefully crafted to fool even the most thorough people into believing that they’ve struck a great deal. In reality, it can be far from it. If you’re at this stage, it wouldn’t hurt to have your term sheets validated by experienced entrepreneurs who’ve gone down this road, as well as your lawyer, who has relevant experience.</p>

<p>Fundraising is a very relationship-centric process; it&#8217;s less science than art. Before starting the fundraising process, I wish I had begun to develop relationships with investors. Cultivating relationships with investors before looking to raise funds is a practice I recommend to every early-stage entrepreneur now. Developing trusting, robust relationships with investors before starting the fundraising process formally will speed your meeting setup and team-vetting process.<br />
