Key Indianapolis Recorder</strong></p>
<p>The Northeastside of Indianapolis is an area that has its assets and disadvantages like any other neighborhood in the city, yet residents and community stakeholders aren’t satisfied with the status quo. They would like to see the area reach its full potential.</p>
<p>In order to harness that desire and turn it into action, the Northeast Corridor Quality of Life plan will be created.</p>
<p>“The area has a lot of potential as far as the parks, the Monon, businesses and some solid residential areas. It also has some real challenges,” said Bill Taft, executive director of the Indianapolis Local Initiatives Support Corp.</p>
<p>While there have been some improvements, the area has seen an increase in vacant houses and industrial sites. Crime rates are less than favorable, which adds to the declining reputation of the area.</p>
<p>Taft attributes some of the challenges to an interstate that would have run through the area that never materialized. Businesses also stopped investing in the area and families moved to other parts of town. Of those that live in the area, many consist of single, Black female-led households. The Monon trail is not being used to its fullest capabilities like other parts of the city. There also has not been a unified, clear vision of area improvement. That’s where the plan comes into place.</p>
<p>The Northeast Corridor Quality of Life Plan offers communities an opportunity to create a shared vision of a better neighborhood.</p>
<p>“We want to empower people to create change. What the plan does is give us direction to what we should be focused on,” said Amandula Anderson, executive director of United North East Community Development Corp.</p>
<p>Thus far, community based groups such as the Edna Martin Christian Center, Habitat for Humanity, The Excel Center, the Forest Manor Multiservice Center and neighborhood representatives from areas such as Devington, Crosstown, Keystone-Millersville and others have come together to first agree to the idea of a plan.</p>
<p>They are currently doing outreach to gather as many organizations, businesses, churches and residents as possible to introduce the plan, get people thinking about what they want to see from the Northeast Corridor Quality of Life Plan and most importantly attend the Vision Summit on June 22 at the Farm Bureau Building at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.</p>
<p>The summit is attendees’ opportunity to give their input to changes they’d like to see.</p>
<p>Janine Betsey, executive director for the King Park Area Development Corp. said at the summit, general data on the neighborhood will be shared including vacant houses, crime statistics and education statuses.</p>
<p>People will also be able to sign up for one of eight action teams, which are: health and wellness, education, housing, commercial services, public safety, livability and connectivity.</p>
<p>“The worst thing for someone to say is ‘we’re telling you all our problems and you’re going to tell us how to fix them.’ That’s not what we want to do. There will not be a consultant coming in. We want the neighbors to say ‘these are our problems, now what resources are out there to fix them,’” said Anderson.</p>
<p>Once the eight teams gather input, another meeting will be convened this fall. The plan will then begin being implemented early next year.</p>
<p>In a recent meeting attended by area stakeholders such as the Indiana State Fair, and the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis, said, “We need to make sure there’s follow through. So many plans have been put into place and no action. We need to make things happen.”</p>
<p>Prime organizers said the Northeast Corridor Quality of Life Plan will certainly have accountability measures. Anderson said that while they hope average citizens remain invested in the plan, they’d like to get the ball rolling right away with small, manageable developments that can help teams see change immediately. One example of that is a commercial façade grant that was given to Mary’s Seafood on East 38th Street used to upgrade the exterior.</p>
<p>Over 19 organizations within the community have signed a memorandum of understanding vowing to be completely engaged and involved in the plan. Also, goals per year for a five-year period will be built into the plan to make sure progress is being made.</p>
<p>“The groups create what they see as success and that will be our benchmark,” said Anderson.</p>
<p>Taft said this plan doesn’t specify how many of these plans will be funded, but Anderson said there may be opportunities to lobby the City of Indianapolis for infrastructure dollars, federal and state grants and recruit businesses directly to the area and encouraging them to invest.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this Northeast Corridor Quality of Life Plan sets a vision and assigns responsibility to start moving that vision forward. While organizations and established businesses are at the forefront of moving the plan along, they’d like the real stakeholders – residents – to get involved and make their voices heard June 22.</p>

<p><em>(Indianapolis, Ind.) </em>On Saturday, June 8, from noon until 5 p.m., the block of East Washington Street between Rural and Oxford will be transformed. Residents, volunteers, artists, businesses, and neighborhood organizations will change the current configuration of five traffic lanes and vacant lots into a vision of what  could be: pedestrian-friendly, tree-lined sidewalks, enhanced transit stops, outdoor dining, public seating, public art, and a mix of small commercial storefronts and businesses – even a protected cycle track.</p>
<p>The project – Better Block Indy: East Washington Street offers a living scale model of how the street could look, feel and be cared for by the neighborhood. It gives residents a possibility to shape East Washington as they imagine it – if only for a Saturday. It will bring to life the best hopes for the corridor to become the economic and civic heart of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the hardest part of community and economic development is envisioning something greater for a place, and then believing the change is possible,” said Joe Bowling, director of the East Washington Street Partnership. “The benefit of the Better Block event is that it transcends the conceptual rendering or charrette in favor of an experience that people can feel and touch. It’s motivating, and turns the block into the kind of vibrant complete street we know it can be.”</p>
<p>Numerous activities and events happen all day during  Better Block, including “Read Together: Right Now”, the kickoff of the summer reading program by the East Washington Street Library, the grand opening of Tlaoli Tamales, beer sampling by Flat 12 and Indiana City Brewing, and art displays by local artists.</p>
<p>“While Saturday’s event is focusing on one block, it’s really a way to celebrate the work of the entire Near Eastside,” said Megan Fetter, Near Eastside community builder. “It’s the physical representation of goals set out in our Quality of Life Plan, which represents years of hard work by residents, organizations, and businesses working hard to create positive and lasting change in this neighborhood.”</p>
<p>The block of East Washington designated for the living demonstration is mentioned in several neighborhood and city plans. Not only is it a part of the Near Eastside Quality of Life Plan (<a href="http://neareastplan.org" target="_blank">http://neareastplan.org</a> ), but also Complete Street policies, bus rapid transit, and various economic development initiatives. It is identified as a strategic development redevelopment site in the East Washington Street Vision Plan (<a href="http://www.eastwashingtonstreet.org/" target="_blank">www.eastwashingtonstreet.org</a>) as the Englewood Town Center. The hope for this sort of project is that it will eventually become permanent, but there is no initial cost in the “study”. Participants can actually try out the vision and adjust based on lessons learned. Feedback is quick, impact is lasting, and implementation builds community in a new way.</p>
<p>Organizers of Better Block Indy: East Washington Street include the East Washington Street Partnership, the Englewood Community Development Corporation, the John H. Boner Community Center, Indy-east Asset Development, and Big Car.</p>
<p>The “Better Block” project is a national initiative. It provides a demonstration tool to help cities around the U.S. that are looking for ways to redevelop communities that enable multi-modal transportation while increasing economic development, and reducing carbon emissions. “Better Block” events act as a living charrette so that communities can actively engage in the buildout process and provide feedback in real time.

Washington St. that originally housed the Irvington Post Office is one step closer to being restored. Hosted by Irvington Development Organization (IDO) and the Irvington Historical Society (IHS), partners in the acquisition and eventual redevelopment of the building, the April event, entitled Save the Irvington Post Office, raised an impressive $12,000 through the generous donations of Irvington-area business owners and residents.</p>
<p>“We wanted to throw together a little event to raise awareness and funds for the building’s renovation,” said Margaret Lawrence Banning, executive director of IDO. “It was going to be a low-ticket, low-key fundraiser with live music, refreshments and a cash bar, and we thought we’d raise maybe $3,000. But, we received an overwhelming response from the Irvington community. Everybody pitched in.”</p>
<p>It started with local band Marc &amp; Friends, featuring IHS board member Paul Diebold, donating its services for the night, followed by Q Artistry Theater in the Irvington Lodge building offering to host it. Neighborhood businesses made financial contributions as well. Reverie Estates and Axia Urban—local developers specializing in the redevelopment of historic properties—both came forth with significant donations to the cause.</p>
<p>“It’s very telling how Reverie Estates and Axia Urban know a thing or two about restoring old buildings and have been such great supporters to this effort,” Lawrence Banning said. “They know what it takes, and they’ve stepped up to help us.”</p>
<p>Another key contributor to the event was popular east side eatery Papa Roux Po-Boys &amp; Cajun Food, which helped boost attendance by offering a free po-boy sandwich coupon with each ticket purchased. More than 100 people attended the event, which offered craft beer from Irvington microbrewery Black Acre Brewing Co., and food from Mac Genie and Chef Dan’s Southern Comfort food trucks. IDO and IHS were thrilled with the turnout and money raised for this noble project.</p>
<p>“It was a spirited event, and it gave neighbors an opportunity to come together for a fun evening and help save the oldest commercial building in Irvington’s Washington Street corridor,” Lawrence Banning said. “Whenever you’re talking about old buildings in Irvington—and there’s Black Acre beer involved— you can count on your friends and neighbors coming to the rescue. We know how important that building is to our community’s history and to the present wellbeing of the business district, and we’re happy that so many of our neighbors are behind us.”</p>
<p>IDO and IHS formed a limited liability corporation (LLC) and purchased the two-story, 2,400-square-foot building last December through a $120,000 loan from Citizen’s Energy Group. Since then, IDO has worked to secure funds for stabilizing the building. At this point, the building has a large hole in the roof and other issues that need immediate attention. A $10,000 grant from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and a $5,000 grant from Indiana Landmarks have been secured, and a matching grant from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology for $50,000 is in the works to restore the original storefront facade. LISC will also provide another $100,000 loan to complete the first phase of the building’s rehabilitation.</p>
<p>IDO is currently looking for parties interested in buying or leasing the building, as well as more donations toward the renovation.

<p>Schools are the most obvious barrier urban family living, with IPS’s chronically-weak overall academic performance dominating this issue.  However, Urban Indy now has the greatest concentration of innovative schools in the state, with a growing list of public and private schools that are at the top of regional academic performance.  In fact, a recent analysis by IFF showed that downtown was very well-served by its schools in comparison with other areas of the county.  My children have received an excellent education in urban schools…it just required more intentional parental involvement to find and support these schools.</p>
<p>After concerns about schools, the biggest objection to urban childrearing is a concern over safety.  A close examination of real safety in the city reveals that crime must be separated into two categories: violent crime that largely impacts people (or their families) engaged in illegal activity, and property/nuisance crimes that isn’t dangerous but frustrates a much larger number of people.  There are essentially “parallel universes” of safety and violence in the city that almost never intersect.  In 21 years of living downtown, none of my children have experienced a violent act.</p>
<p>The perception that urban neighborhoods house only the very poor and small clusters of young singles is another argument made against urban living for children.  This argument seems to be based on the assumption that kids thrive when surrounded by children and families like theirs, as is often the case in newer suburban areas.  However, I really believe that the mix of young professionals, empty-nesters, college students, and elderly people, (and a growing number of like-minded families) has enriched childhood for my kids, equipping them to interact with a wide range of people around them.</p>
<p>The suburbs are designed around recreational facilities for families, so many assume that the city lacks places for children and young adults to interact.  While downtown may not have the density of youth sports and recreational amenities of newer suburbs, it offers unique sports opportunities downtown like gymnastics, fencing, synchronized swimming, and cycling, that are world-class and unavailable in the suburbs, that have opened up amazing scholarship and travel opportunities to urban kids.  These sports are complemented by an array of parks, libraries, and museums that provide educational and recreational activities at low cost and can be accessed on a bicycle or a bus when parents are unavailable to play taxi.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that kids who grow up immersed in the complex beauty and ugliness of urban culture are more likely to mature quickly and skip the typical anger and alienation from family and surrounding culture experienced by so many teenagers.  It is hard to feel that this year’s family vacation or beater car your parents let you drive aren’t good enough when you know families that can’t even afford one car that could make it to another city.  The peer pressure to conform that causes so much suburban angst is far less potent at an urban school with so many distinct sub-cultures that there is no dominant model of conformity.  I believe that the experience of growing up in new schools and neighborhoods struggling to revitalize themselves has given my children a big, compelling cause to be part of that puts real demands on their intellect and unites them with their parents, neighbors, and teachers.  What more could parents want for their children?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty amazing how accessible we are by bus!  Certainly cheaper to ride the bus to a meeting at the Platform than pay for parking. More than 20 IndyGo routes drop you practically at our front door. </p>
<p>Or how walking or biking along that amazing Cultural Trail?  The Alabama Street portion gets you right to our office in the West Wing of the Indianapolis City Market.</p>
<p>So ditch the car and bus it, bike it or trail it toThe Platform and leave your parking woes behind &#8212;- or at least look at your options <a href="http://theplatformindy.org/contact/parking-at-the-platform/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

The Indy Food Council will unveil its vision and a call for community support on Thursday, April 25, from 5-7 p.m. at the Platform in the west wing of the Indianapolis City Market. The public is invited to learn more about the Indy Food Council and how to get involved.</p>
<p>“Ensuring access to nutritious food such as fresh fruits and vegetables is critical to good health,” said Dr. Virginia Caine, director of the Marion County Public Health Department. “A healthy food system will help us address issues such as the continued rise of obesity and diabetes in Marion County.”</p>
<p>The Indy Food Council is a collaboration of several community groups and universities that want to connect food system stakeholders and advance ideas and initiatives that will grow a healthier, more sustainable food system in Indianapolis. To move forward, the Indy Food Council Organizing Committee is seeking involvement from anyone with ideas for strengthening the local food economy and creating healthy communities.</p>
<p>The organizing event on April 25 will include a brief presentation on the four core elements of the Indy Food Council—economy, ecology, social justice and health—and will outline how to become involved in building the Indy Food Council. Afterward, participants will be invited to enjoy local foods provided by Indianapolis vendors and learn more about the Indy Food Council’s first two initiatives: the Indy Food Fund and the Indy Food Fellows.</p>
<p>“The Indy Food Council is a necessary piece of healthy food infrastructure that will allow Indianapolis to improve quality of life for all citizens,” said Jeremy Efroymson, whose pioneering support of the local food system through the Efroymson Family Fund has been critical in laying the ground work for this effort. “We want to get members of the community actively involved. The Council will only be successful with broad community support and consensus.”</p>
<p>The Indy Food Council Organizing Committee includes the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, Butler University’s Center for Urban Ecology, Marion County Public Health Department, Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County, Growing Places Indy, Indy Grown, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, Indiana Recycling Coalition, Indy Hunger Network, and the City of Indianapolis/Office of Sustainability.</p>

<p>In the past decade, Indianapolis has become a hotbed of reform efforts aimed at radically improving public education. At the same time, our urban neighborhoods often suffer from poor reputations and declining populations due in large part to the public perception of their schools. A recent analysis shows that some of Indy&#8217;s neighborhoods are well-served by their schools while others are terribly underserved. Reform efforts are attempting to improve existing school districts, start new charter schools, prepare pre-school children for school, and effectively challenge and support many more youth to attain college degrees.</p>
<p>What exactly is the nature of the connection between these reform efforts and neighborhood vitality? Are there opportunities to improve the synergy between education reform and neighborhood development efforts?</p>
