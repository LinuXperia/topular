<p>Even though the state took over four IPS failing schools in 2011, the President of the Indianapolis Public Schools Board says the recent controversy regarding of the Christel DeHaan Charter School is forcing it to request all internal records regarding the process despite the fact it was a year later.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br/>In a news release put out by the District,  IPS has submitted public records requests to both the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) and the State Board of Education for any internal records pertaining to the state’s decision to award “Fs” to four combined IPS schools that serve both middle school students and high school students and to intervene in those<a name="_GoBack"></a> four schools.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to IPS Board of School Commissioners’ President Diane Arnold,IPS believes a review of the specific circumstances surrounding the IPS combined schools is warranted given the recent media reports concerning IDOE’s treatment of Christel House and a handful of other combined charter schools.</p>
<p><span> </span>“The accountability system is supposed to be transparent,” Arnold said. “It is in the best interest of our students and their families for all of the facts surrounding the school takeovers to be disclosed to the public and reviewed in the light of day.”</p>
<p>IPS filed the public records request with the Indiana Department of Education on Tuesday, August 13 and filed with the State Board of Education on Wednesday, August 14.</p>
<p>It is worth noting the IPS takeover occurred in 2011, while the Bennett grading controversy was in 2012.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58338366876";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58338366876";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 12:09:47 -0400";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Pence Names Auditor";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1426:"<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/63a0d61a7bfee2c4f532d5ab628909e0/tumblr_inline_mrkuwnxDbk1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>Although there is a lot of speculation as to who Indiana Governor Mike Pence will pick tomorrow for State Auditor tomorrow to replace Tim Berry, Indy Politics has learned at least three names can be ruled out.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Sources tell Indy Politics that former Marion County Clerk Doris Anne Sadler, State Representative Tom Saunders and Jillean Long Battle were all notified that they way not being selected.</p>
<p>That would mean that still in the running are Brownsburg Town Council President Dwayne Sawyer, Indy City-Council Minority Leader Mike McQuillen and Fishers attorney Celia Castro Coble.</p>
<p>An announcement will be made tomorrow at 9:15 a.m.</p>

Indy Politics has not been able to connect with Sawyer yet, however we do know Pence was very intrigued with his information technology background. </p>

<p>by Abdul-Hakim Shabazz</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58154836789" target="_blank">announcement</a> of a $14 million settlement between the Indiana State Teachers Association (ISTA), the National Education Association (NEA) and the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office is raising some questions that I think the current Superintendent of Public Instruction, <strong>Glenda Ritz, </strong>needs to answer and do it soon.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>ISTA and the NEA were accused of engaging in a &#8220;Ponzi-like&#8221; scheme where they would sell health insurance plans to teachers and school districts and then use the proceeds to fund its disability program while misleading schools and educators about how much they had in their accounts.</p>
<p>Ritz served on the Board of ISTA during the time as well as being the head of the Washington Township Educators Union in Indianapolis.  In those capacities as a Board member and union head, Ritz would have had a fiduciary duty to look out for the best interests of her members.  Which in turns raises several questions&#8230;</p>
<ol><li>Did Ritz have any knowledge that ISTA and the NEA were engaging in what the Secretary of State&#8217;s office called a &#8220;Ponzi-like&#8221; scheme?</li>
<li>If so, when did Ritz first become aware of the scheme and what was her reaction?</li>
<li>Was she involved in any active or passing selling/promoting of the ISTA-NEA health insurance plan to her bargaining unit in Washington Township schools?</li>
<li>Did Ritz herself purchase any of the health insurance plan that that was pushed by ISTA?</li>
<li>Once the scheme was discovered, did she speak out against it, either as an ISTA Board member or Union President?</li>
<li>Will Ritz demand that ISTA and the NEA fully refund all teachers and school districts for the original $28 million that was lost in the scheme, as opposed to the $14 million that both sides have initially agreed to settle?</li>
<li>Are there any other ticking time bombs out there regarding ISTA that teachers, school districts and the taxpayers should know?</li>
<li>Will Ritz make public any and all correspondence (memos, emails, etc), electronic and otherwise, regarding the ISTA-NEA alleged &#8220;Ponzi-scheme&#8221;?</li>
<li>Does Ritz think teachers and the public can trust ISTA and the NEA?</li>
<li>Will the answers to any of these questions ever see the light of day?</li>
</ol><p>Of course critics will try to dismiss these questions as the rantings and sour grapes of a Tony Bennett supporter, but that does not change the fact that millions of dollars were funneled away from school districts and teachers and used in a scheme that at best was irresponsible and worst, securities fraud.</p>
<p>The current Superintendent of Public Instruction has a responsibility to disclose to the public and her fellow teachers what she knew and when she became aware of it. </p>
<p>It is the least she can do.  Hopefully, she will do it soon.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58235416536";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58235416536";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:43:23 -0400";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"glenda ritz";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"ista";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"nea";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"superintendent";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Tim&#039;s Last Day";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1108:"<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/cd739110deda173c69b0a359896db5a4/tumblr_inline_mrips445pi1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>Berry says he is proud of the work he has done as Auditor, helping protect the taxpayers&#8217; dollars.  And as Chairman, he looks forward to reaching out individuals who he see says shares Republican values, but don&#8217;t necessarily vote for the GOP.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Secretary of State Connie Lawson announced today that her office has reached an agreement in principle regarding terms of a settlement for $14 million with the Indiana State Teachers Association (ISTA) and the National Education Association (NEA) for allegedly defrauding Hoosier teachers out of over $27 million.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>The Secretary of State’s office alleged that ISTA and the NEA sold health plans, which were unregistered securities, to 27 school corporations. ISTA and the NEA then made misrepresentations regarding these securities and improperly commingled funds. The tentative $14 million settlement will go to the school corporations to compensate for their lost investments. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> “This is the right result for teachers and schools,” said Secretary Lawson.  “The tentative amount puts roughly 50 cents for every dollar lost from this mismanagement back to the school corporations.  While $14 million is a significant amount, it does not cover ISTA’s nor the NEA’s full financial obligation to the school corporations. We remain confident in our case, but took the leadership step to get this money in hand for schools as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ISTA offered teachers and other school employees a medical plan that allowed school corporations to invest their excess balances to offset future health care costs. In the Secretary of State’s complaint, the office alleges that ISTA didn’t invest the money, but instead used the money to cover significant shortfalls in their long-term disability plan. ISTA continuously issued quarterly and annual statements to schools misrepresenting fund balances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> ISTA and the NEA have made several attempts to have the case dismissed and skirt their financial responsibilities to the schools. ISTA has tried to portray themselves as the victim and tried to push all of the blame on David Karandos and state-level ISTA employees who managed ISTA’s investments. ISTA was a victim in the David Karandos case, but this case against ISTA and the NEA is distinct. In this case, the Secretary of State’s office believes ISTA used the money it took from school health plans to cover shortfalls in its long-term disability plan and to invest in risky securities with David Karandos for its own benefit, instead of investing on behalf of the schools as promised.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> “ISTA was blatantly covering up their Ponzi-like scheme through falsified account statements,” said Secretary Lawson. “Repeatedly doctoring account statements to create the illusion that investment funds exist after they’ve been misappropriated is shameful. I hope this case will serve as a warning to others who think they can take advantage of their investors and as a reminder to investors to keep a vigilant eye on their investments. I further believe that ISTA and the NEA have the moral obligation to repay the full amount of losses suffered by these schools.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ISTA and the NEA have agreed to settlement terms that would return $14 million to the 27 school corporations.  The settlement must be agreed upon by each school corporation to avoid sending the case to trial. An October trial date is still on the docket of U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> This litigation was not fought at the taxpayers’ expense.  All legal fees were paid from fines collected from violators of Indiana’s securities laws.  Secretary Lawson waived the right to levy fines against ISTA and the NEA and to seek repayment of attorney fees so as not to diminish the total amount the school corporations will receive if the settlement is finalized.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> “I want to thank my team, Securities Commissioner Chris Naylor and Associate General Counsel Carol Mihalik, for their diligent work over the last four years,” said Secretary Lawson. “It has been a long road, but I believe this agreement, while tentative, is a victory for cash-strapped school corporations and a moment of closure for teachers whose healthcare premiums were misused.”</p>

<p>Although his office says he is not necessarily calling for a tax increase, Marion County Prosecutor <strong>Terry Curry</strong> says the Mayor and City-County Council need to find a way to put more officers on the street.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Curry sent a letter to the Mayor expressing concern that IMPD was by some estimates down by 700 officers for a city the size of Indianapolis.   However, the Ballard administration has pointed out their previous plan to reallocated IMPD&#8217;s manpower and put up 100 officers on the street and add another 100 officers by 2014.</p>
<p>Curry says the city should look at short and long-term options to add more officers, but would not come out and say the city should raise taxes to do it.</p>
<p>You can hear Curry&#8217;s comments below, as well as reaction from city spokesman Marc Lotter.  The audio is courtesy WIBC Afternoon News. Each segment runs about 5 minutes.</p>

<p><span>Governor Mike Pence today announced he will lead a delegation of Hoosier business leaders and elected officials on his first gubernatorial overseas jobs and economic development mission to <span class="il">Japan</span>. </span></p>
<p><span><!-- more --></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The governor will depart Indiana on <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1729336089"><span class="aQJ">Sept. 5</span></span> and return on <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1729336090"><span class="aQJ">Sept. 14</span></span>. During the trip, he will travel to Tokyo, Nagoya and Tochigi Prefecture, Indiana’s <span class="il">Japanese</span> sister-state. He will attend the <span class="il">Japan</span>-U.S. Midwest Conference and will meet with government and business leaders and potential investors. Calls to executives from Honda, Toyota and Subaru as well as other companies with Indiana operations will also be part of the governor’s agenda while in <span class="il">Japan</span>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> &#8221;From leading automotive manufacturers to their diverse array of suppliers, <span class="il">Japan</span>’s top companies have found homes across all corners of the Hoosier State,” said Pence. “Our administration aims to continue to nurture and grow the strong bond between Indiana and <span class="il">Japan</span> that dates back nearly 100 years and has led to more than 42,000 Hoosier jobs in recent years. I look forward to renewing our commitment to <span class="il">Japan</span>, opening doors for new investment and jobs in Indiana and telling the story of Indiana as a state that works in America.” </span></p>
<p><span>Indiana counts <span class="il">Japan</span> as its largest Asian trading partner. It is Indiana’s fifth-largest export country in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Trade Database. Nearly 44,000 Hoosiers are employed by more than 200&#160;<span class="il">Japanese</span> companies located in the state. </span><span>Indiana is the only U.S. state that is home to three <span class="il">Japanese</span> original equipment manufacturer automotive companies, Subaru, Toyota and Honda.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The cost of the state delegation is being covered entirely through private donations to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation; no tax dollars will be used. In addition to Governor Pence, the state will be represented by First Lady Karen Pence and Secretary of Commerce Victor Smith. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) has an office in Nagoya and representatives will assist with trip arrangements. </span><em><span><br/><br/></span></em><span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Since 2005, the IEDC has secured projects with 82&#160;<span class="il">Japan</span>-based companies, projecting to create nearly 10,500 new jobs and invest more than $4.1 billion in their Indiana operations. Earlier this year, Pence joined executives from Subaru Automotive of Indiana to announce the company’s plans to invest more than $400 million to expand its Lafayette operations and add production of the Subaru Impreza, creating up to 900 new jobs. Other <span class="il">Japanese</span> companies to recently announce investment plans in Indiana include Nishikawa Cooper in Bremen, NSK Corp. in Franklin and Sunright America in Columbus.</span></p>

<p>Sources familiar with U.S. Attorney <strong>Joe Hogsett&#8217;s</strong> investigation into the Indianapolis Land Bank probe say he has for all intent and purposes completed his work and there aren&#8217;t likely to be any more indictments of city employees.</p>

<p>Back in May, Hogsett  announced charges against Reggie Walton and John Hawkins, two employees of the Department of Metropolitan Development, for allegedly taking kickbacks for selling abandoned homes to not-for-profits which later sold them to for profits groups and got cut a cut of the proceeds. </p>
<p>The city had suspended all Land Bank transitions in the wake of the scandal.  A trial is set to begin in late February.  </p>
<p>Since a trial date has been set, the sources say Hogsett&#8217;s office is very likely done with it&#8217;s criminal probe and there was no evidence that the land bank scandal went any further than then city employees Hawkins and Walton. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58052891163";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://www.indypolitics.org/post/58052891163";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 08:03:00 -0400";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"joe hogsett";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"land bank";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Ready to Hob Nob?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:819:"<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4f779c8d4ca3e52a8200b8cff5dafd19/tumblr_inline_mrf20dbvtN1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p><span><strong>by Greg Zoeller</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Why would the Indiana Attorney General wade into a United States Supreme Court case over the opening prayers said at town council meetings in western New York state?  </span></p>

<p><span><!-- more --></span></p>

<p><span>It’s a reasonable question Hoosiers might ask after my office filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that could decide whether the widespread practice of prayer at the start of legislative meetings is constitutional.  In analyzing the long history and tradition of opening meetings with prayer, our brief contends that prayers initiated by citizens themselves – including prayers that invoke God, Jesus, Allah and other deities – do not violate the First Amendment prohibition on government establishing religion.  Our brief argues that government assemblies are not proselytizing if they allow citizen expression of such prayers at the start of meetings.  The Texas attorney general co-authored our brief and a bipartisan group of AGs from 21 other states signed it, reflecting the legal importance of the question.</span></p>

<p><span>As Indiana’s attorney general, I serve as lawyer for state government and argue on the side of state authority and in defense of state officials’ actions.  My office routinely files friend-of-the-court briefs, also called amicus briefs, in Supreme Court cases where Indiana and other states are not plaintiffs or defendants but have a legal interest that the Court ought to hear.  Since 2009, my office has authored or co-authored 23 amicus briefs that other states joined, and we joined 89 briefs other states have authored, at no additional cost to taxpayers.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>When important legal issues involving state authority come before the U.S. Supreme Court, my office cannot shrink from a case or stand mute because the case is controversial.  It’s important for Indiana to weigh in on the upcoming Supreme Court case of <em> Greece v. Galloway</em>, because the Indiana House of Representatives was subjected to a similar lawsuit in recent years. Municipal and state officials face uncertainty when deciding whether to start legislative meetings with prayer, and the Supreme Court could bring an end to that confusion.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>While the Supreme Court upheld legislative prayer 30 years ago, a conflicting hodgepodge of federal appeals court rulings since then has left officials facing expensive, time-consuming lawsuits over legislative prayer practices.  Such litigation only benefits plaintiffs’ lawyers.  My office’s government clients need some element of certainty and we cannot give them clear legal advice without a conclusive Supreme Court ruling.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Indianapolis Public Schools’ Board of School Commissioners Friday unanimously approved Dr. Lewis Ferebee as the District’s new superintendent.<span> </span> <!-- more --></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ferebee, who has been the Chief of Staff for Durham Public Schools, will begin his work Monday, September 23.<span>  </span>Peggy Hinckley will remain as Interim Superintendent until then.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> District officials say Ferebee’s extensive experience in attenuating the impact of poverty on academic achievement boasts strategic turnaround for struggling Title I schools, double-digit gains in End of Course Assessments (ECA) for Biology, Algebra and English, and aggressive reductions in the dropout rate with concurrent increases in the graduation rate as compared to state performance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ferebee spoke with the media shortly afterward addressing IPS&#8217; finances, school accountability, and why he isn&#8217;t starting until late September.</p>

<p>The rule changes were made today at the Committee on Committees meeting.  In the past each party chose their own council members to sit on committees, now the Democrats will make that decision.</p>
<p>Council member <strong>Marylyn Pfisterer</strong> was removed from public safety and replaced with <strong>Christine Scales</strong>.  Also <strong>Brian Mahern</strong> was removed from his position on the Rules and Public Policy Committee.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader <strong>Scott Pelath</strong> and Senate Democratic Leader <strong>Tim Lanane</strong> say they want a &#8220;fundamental review&#8221; of the office&#8217;s duties.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>In a letter to Inspector General Dave Thomas, the two lawmakers say they have concerns about a number of &#8220;troubling cases&#8221; and question whether the state should update its ethics code.</p>
<p>A copy of the letter is published below&#8230;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Inspector General David Thomas</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Office of the Inspector General</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>315 West Ohio Street, Room 104</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Indianapolis, Indiana  46202</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Dear Inspector General:</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          In recent weeks and months, a series of incidents have generated the kind of attention that calls into question the accountability of state government to the people of Indiana. <br/></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          The most recent of these incidents is the highly-publicized case involving former state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett and the controversies over the misuse of the A through F grading system.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>           Taken as a whole, we believe the circumstances surrounding each of these cases demonstrate the need for a fundamental review of the duties of the Inspector General’s office and the code of ethics presently in place for executive branch officials.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>            Let us explain why.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>            As we mentioned, the Bennett case is one of several issues that could potentially fall under review by your office:</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>            * On <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_847798041"><span class="aQJ">April 14</span></span>, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette reported that the Indiana Department of Education under former Superintendent Bennett purchased $1.7 million in computer equipment that was incompatible with existing software.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>            * On <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_847798042"><span class="aQJ">June 7</span></span>, after your office blessed Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) employee Troy Woodruff&#8217;s business connections surrounding the development of Interstate 69, the South Bend Tribune reported that INDOT employees were prohibited from communicating about the matter.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>             * On <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_847798043"><span class="aQJ">July 1</span></span> &#8212; nearly two months after the event was discovered by agency personnel &#8212; the Family and Social Services Agency (FSSA) publicly announced a data breach of confidential information for 187,533 clients.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>              * On July 14 and July 21, the Indianapolis Star reported that an Indiana Economic Development Corporation contractor had steered state taxpayer investment funds to a firm run by the IEDC’s chairman and his son.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>              * Also on July 14, the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette reported that the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) had overcharged the public for services rendered;</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>              Now we are hearing that former Superintendent Bennett intends to use your office to absolve himself of any alleged ethical missteps in the recent &#8220;A-F&#8221; grading controversy.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>              While we would respectfully opine that such a request is rugged new terrain for your office, we would like to understand your plan for handling such an unusual matter.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>              In light of the above, we have several questions:</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          1. Has your office been requested or directed to investigate the recent “A-F” grading controversy or any of these issues?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          2. Do you think your office has jurisdiction over the recent “A-F” grading controversy or any of these issues?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          3. If so, when do you intend to have the investigations completed? Will the results be made public?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          4. Will former Superintendent Bennett&#8217;s request take precedence over other matters when it is received?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>          5. Will your office address the impact of the &#8220;A-F&#8221; grading controversy on the use of federal funds for public education in Indiana?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>               Finally, some have debated the narrowness of the Inspector General&#8217;s rulings on both the Woodruff complaint and the case involving former Governor Daniels, whose immediate transition from the position of governor to president of Purdue University apparently met the letter &#8212; if not the spirit &#8212; of current regulations.</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>               Given these concerns, does your office intend to pursue an update of the executive branch&#8217;s code of ethics? If not, why not?</em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>               We genuinely appreciate your prompt and thoughtful consideration of this inquiry. We assure you that we would much prefer the discussion of other issues, but occasionally events before the public merit a reconsideration of what is working and what is not. In any case, we look forward to your detailed response.</em></p>
<p><em>               As always, we remain grateful for your dedicated service to the people of Indiana.</em></p>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS – Total tax revenues for July – the first month of the 2014 fiscal year – came in slightly below projections used to write the current state budget.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>The revenue for the month totaled $1.04 billion. It would have been higher but the state budget, which took effect July 1, directed that some sales tax revenue be transferred to a fund for road construction.</p>

<p>Even if that revenue – about $5.9 million – had been added back into the general fund, however, revenues still missed the monthly target by less than 1 percent.</p>

<p>Overall, sales tax collections – including the portion used for road construction – increased by 3.4 percent compared to July 2012.</p>

<p>The forecast released in April projected that sales tax collections would grow by 3.9 percent for the full 2014 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Individual income tax collections totaled $319 million for the month, which is a 17.8 percent drop from collections for the same month last year. A large decline was expected though since the timing of withholding payments is influenced by the number of Fridays in a month.</p>

<p>June 2012 had five of those Friday paydays, which meant more money was sent to the state the following month. This year, June had the normal four.</p>

<p>The individual income tax collections were 3.6 percent below the target for July 2013.</p>

<p>Corporate income tax collections were higher than forecasted but still lower than a year ago.</p>
