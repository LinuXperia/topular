<p>The late Joe O’Malia was a master at empowering the employees of his companies to make decisions based on the best interests of THE CUSTOMER. Not many companies today trust their employees to make decisions. Those that do will offer the best service.</p>
<p>In order to be able to empower your people on the level of, oh, say a Nordstrom or a Chick-Fil-A, you must first be VERY CAREFUL whom you hire. You must hire only those who are capable of fitting into your company’s culture. This takes a great deal of thought and effort. There are companies that can help you screen potential employees but whatever you do, be careful to hire the right person.</p>
<p>You must then take the time to properly TRAIN the employee in the skills of the job but also  to help them understand that culture and help them desire to add to the culture rather than to detract from it. My experience is that in tough times companies cut back on things like proper hiring procedures and training. That’s the worst thing a company can do.</p>
<p>When asked why she’d been such a successful business woman, the late Mary Kay Ash (Mary Kay Cosmetics) answered, “I tried to hire really nice people and then I tried to let them be as nice as they could be.”</p>
<p>And that means EMPOWERED EMPLOYEES. Employees who feel free to break a rule or two if it’s in the best interest of the customer. Which reminds me of a great Nordstrom story!</p>
<p>A harried businessman rushed into a Nordstrom store in a mall at 5:00 PM and hurried to the perfume counter. He asked the SERVICE person if they carried a certain brand of perfume, explaining that this was his anniversary and he had to meet his wife for dinner in one hour and he had done NO planning. The clerk told him the store didn’t carry that brand but said she might be able to help, asking him how long he’d be at the mall.</p>
<p>The customer, obviously quite nervous, told her he had stops to make at the florist and candy store in the mall. She told him to come back in a half hour and she’d have THE perfume for him. He trusted her. IT WAS NORDSTROM.</p>
<p>As he left, the SERVICE person hailed her fellow employee and asked her to watch both counters while she took care of a customer. That employee was glad to help. So she left the store, went to Macy’s at the other end of the mall (which she knew carried THE perfume), bought the perfume, returned and wrapped it, and when the customer showed up with candy and flowers, THE perfume was waiting and wrapped.</p>
<p>Several things here:</p>
<p>•	The husband went to NORDSTROM—no place else—with his problem.<br />
•	Both SERVICE LADIES broke rules by leaving their posts.<br />
•	The first SERVICE LADY no doubt broke a rule by going to Macy’s, buying the product there and selling it at Nordstrom (or maybe not—Nordstrom has very few rules for employees when it comes to SERVICE).<br />
•	How was that for TEAMWORK?</p>
<p>Nordstrom obviously hired two good people. They TRAINED and EMPOWERED them to rescue the beleaguered customer. That’s why he went there!</p>
<p>If giving service like Nordstrom were easy, every company would do it. It’s not. But it CAN be done!</p>

<p>Here is the one you have been looking for. The last step in the referral process is a relatively easy step for your referral source, assuming they have been trained properly. This is the step where the work you have done thus far turns into the possibility of business. It is the appointment. When trained correctly your referral source can now set up an appointment for you and the prospect to meet. They have done a good job identifying need and building your credibility when they offer your company as the solution, now they set the appointment.</p>
<p>This is your opportunity to meet the referred prospect, build some rapport with them and possibly close a deal. If your referral source has done a good job they have passed you a level 10 referral, which means the deal is done, all that is left is the paper work! The higher the level of the referral, the less work in the sales process you will have to do to close the deal. With proper training and preparation your referral source should be able to pass you high level referrals consistently.</p>
<p>Note: Anything your referral sources are doing for you, you should be doing the same for them.</p>
<p>It is important to remember in this step you have one key commitment to your referrals source, you must leave them looking good to the prospect, no matter what. That is what they trust you to do, if that means, walking away from the deal because it is not a good fit, that is your obligation to the referral source.</p>
<p>Remember: A referral is an opportunity to do business, it is not a guaranteed sale.</p>
<p>Once you have had the appointment with the prospect, don&#8217;t forget to call your referral source and let them know how the meeting went. Review your referral process and discuss what went well and what might have been done differently in the process.</p>
<p>Passing referrals is a business process and you should have a carefully constructed strategy around the getting and giving or referral. The process is much like dancing, you both must learn all the steps and practice them often. Both the referral source and you must be in sync with one another, constantly going over the steps and making sure the process is working for both of you otherwise, you may be stepping on someones toes.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of conferences I have attended that shout from the rooftops about being successful. They talk about the world as if it were a malleable piece of clay. Other ideas include building a better story in your life. Who wouldn’t want to attend a conference about bettering your life? I’m not talking about the “live your best life now” or a smiling Tony Robbins raining his praises and neural linguistic fueled smile down upon his followers. I’m talking about a bare bones build out of how to live your life and tell an unforgettable story.</p>
<p>We are all living in a script filled world… do you want the best script or one that is tossed?</p>
<p>Every piece of marketing is a story. Everything you do is followed by a story line. There are inciting incidents in life that bring on success or failure. The same applies to marketing. Are you telling the true story of your brand?</p>
<p>In writing, an inciting incident is the moment a script kicks a story into motion. It occurs after the setup of the characters/plot and everything that follows should be a result of that incident. It’s where a story really begins. In movies, there is usually one inciting incident that changes the landscape of the storyline so drastically that you have to watch for the end result.The same idea applies to your life. However, you will have multiple inciting incidents (both good and bad) that will help build your story over the course of your life.</p>
<p>I can now pinpoint different “inciting incidents” that have formed my opinion of life. Can you think of different inciting incidences that have formed the future of the top companies in the world? I can think of a few.</p>
<p>Your story is the only thing that is actually yours in life. You have the ability to tell your story in any way you see it. Do you want the main character of your story to be healthy? Do you want them to be successful and live a fulfilled life? Or do you want to live a tragedy.</p>
<p>The same storyline applies to your business or job. Are you doing everything in your power to write a successful story for your employees? Are you building a place where people feel fulfilled? Are you creating a brand that moves people to engage, give, and buy?</p>
<p>There is beauty behind the concept of rewriting your story. We are all on this path towards an ending. What type of conflicts, successes, mountain and valleys are you going to take to reach the climax of your life?</p>
<p>Are you striving to write a better story?</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised…. that by writing a better story for yourself…. everything else will fall into line.</p>

<p>Nothing is more important to the long term success of a family business than the transition between the first (G1) and second (G2) generation. Approximately 30% of family businesses make it from the first to the second generation, 70% don’t. One might think that making this transition would be easy, but that isn’t the case. The first transfer is the toughest; and yet, if done correctly, it can become the cornerstone for future generations.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial founders are typically “type D” personalities. They are highly driven, strong leaders and intelligent. They are driven to success – so driven that they often neglect their family during the early years, causing future baggage. They treat their business as their “baby”, giving it equal status with their other children and being just as concerned with its wellbeing and future. Mind you, as the business goes through its growth phase, these owners believe that what is good for the business is good for the family and vice versa. They frequently express – formally or not – that value to the family and value to the business are one in the same. As success and wealth accumulate, the founders begin the soul searching of what’s next for both the family and the business.</p>
<p>Enter the next generation. They enter the business for a variety of reasons: to remain close to their parents, financial security, fast-track careers, future ownership, family legacy, or just because it is expected. Regardless of the reasons for entry, once employed, future ownership is assumed, as is the ascent to management and control. These topics are rarely discussed and even less frequently planned. Parents remain in control until they either willingly give up part of the kingdom or events (like death or disability) require change. Let’s face it &#8211; the path of succession becomes a long and winding road for G2.</p>
<p>As time passes, the children are more firmly entrenched in the management of the business and the founders (G1) are semi-retired. Semi-retirement lacks any real definition – it seems to mean less work, but not less compensation or less control. This phase is very confusing to everyone. Parents don’t understand why their children don’t accept that they have made all this possible and they will control the purse strings for as long as they like. Middle-aged children have been waiting for a chance to really take over and prove themselves without parental oversight. Employees wonder: who is the boss? Outsiders try to define who makes what decisions only to find that it changes routinely. It is very confusing – and still no one wants to come to the table to establish a plan.</p>
<p>The problem is that the stars aren’t aligned and no one is even looking through the telescope. Parents want financial security and what is best for the family. They see that being accomplished through their life’s work – the business. They usually want to remain in control until they feel confident that their goals will be met &#8211; financial security, family harmony and family legacy. All three are important and the potential failure of any one is just cause to remain in control.</p>
<p>The children don’t necessarily see it that way. They can buy into financial security for Mom and Dad, but not necessarily for the inactive siblings, or to the extent that wealth bypasses them and passes to the grandchildren. Since Cain and Abel, sibling rivalry has existed in most families with more than one child, and the children aren’t always as committed as Mom and Dad to family harmony. As for the family legacy, frequently the children find working under the thumb of G1 demeaning.</p>
<p>How to align the stars? Try focusing the telescope. Here are some suggestions to get that accomplished.</p>
<p>1. Draft a clear Vision/Mission Statement and gain buy-in from all existing and future players, then focus decision-making on meeting the defined criteria.<br />
2. Address family financial security, family harmony and family legacy directly and transparently and include all players.<br />
3. G1 &#8211; develop retirement activities outside of the business so that the business does not become the retirement activity.<br />
4. Empower business decision makers (G2) with real control and formally evaluate the results.<br />
5. Separate the importance of family from the value of the business asset.</p>
