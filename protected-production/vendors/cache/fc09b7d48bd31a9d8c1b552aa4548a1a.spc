<p>At the end of June, when DOMA and Prop 8 were repealed, our own governor Mike Pence stated his sorrow over these repeals, and he reiterated that, in his view, marriage should be reserved for one man and one woman.  He stated, &#8220;Now that the Supreme Court has had its say on the federal government’s role in defining marriage, the people of Indiana should have their say about how marriage is understood and defined in our state&#8230;.  I look forward to supporting efforts by members of the Indiana General Assembly to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot for voter consideration next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>This caused a firestorm on Facebook and other social media sites.  Many people got angry with the governor for his statements.  A lot of talk was generated about HJR-6 and what should be done and how it should be done, etc.  Everyone seemed to have their own ideas.</p>
<p>Well, we are now at the brink.  The campaign to repeal HJR-6 is going to kick off within the next few weeks.  Led by Indiana Equality Action and other allied organizations, a campaign to mobilize thousands of people will be underway.  There will be phone banking, canvassing, and letter-writing taking place all throughout Indiana.</p>
<p>We already have a list of people who have volunteered to take part in these activities.  But that list is very small compared to what we need.  I recently read that the campaign in Minnesota mobilized 50,000 people to make phone calls.  That is what it&#8217;s going to take here in Indiana to do the work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I am asking you to make the commitment NOW to join with us to repeal HJR-6.  It&#8217;s one thing to discuss it on Facebook, but we need real live bodies to do the necessary and important work.  Please volunteer to make calls and write letters.  Send me your name, e-mail address and phone number, and you will be put on the list.  As soon as these actions begin to take place, you will be contacted.  In addition, please share this request with your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors&#8211;and those in any organization you belong to.</p>
<p>This bill is intended to prevent all LGBT Hoosiers from being able to get legally married.  And the second sentence—a very muddy one—would prevent any relationship &#8220;similar to marriage&#8221; from also becoming legal.  Remember­­, we are not fighting for same-sex marriage rights in Indiana right now, we are working to stop a ban of same-sex marriage from getting into our state constitution.</p>
<p>So, please, contact me at <b>annette.gross@indianafreedom.org</b>.  I cannot stress how important it is that as many people as possible throughout the state join with us to fight this discriminatory amendment.  It will take a lot of work and a lot of people-power, but it can be done!  Thank you!!!!</p>

I’ll come to that soon, but first—Henrietta Lacks? Who is she and why am I writing about he.</p>
<p>Henrietta Lacks would have been remembered by family, friends, and neighbors, but she would not be written about had it not been for the circumstances that accompanied her disease and death. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" target="_blank">Henrietta Lacks</a> was a semi-literate, African-American woman from Clover, Virginia (born in Roanoke). She died from ovarian cancer in 1951 at the young age of 31 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. It was the closest hospital to her home in Baltimore County that would treat black patients.  When she was first treated at Johns Hopkins, less than a year before her death, biopsy samples were collected of both healthy and cancerous cells from her uterus. When Dr. George Otto Gey took those cells and grew them in his laboratory, he discovered something unique and revolutionary. Some of those cells kept growing and dividing, over and over—and NEVER stopped. He had discovered the first immortal human cell line, the HeLa cell. What this meant for biomedical research cannot be understated. Among other things, it meant that the experiments conducted this month and the experiments conducted next month could use what were essentially the exact same cells. Researchers in San Francisco, New York and London, Mumbai and Tokyo could all use the exact same cells. HeLa cells were used in the development of the Salk polio vaccine. They were used in research on Parkinson’s disease, AIDS, leukemia, influenza and countless other diseases. They were sent into space to study the effects of zero gravity on the cells.</p>
<p>To see the importance of what we are talking about, I did a quick search in the National Library of Medicine&#8217;s online database for the number of published articles using some different cell lines. The C4 rat glioma cell, a cell line popular for basic research that I used in my studies, listed 15,326 articles; the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line listed 17,095; the list for HeLa cells was 76,057.</p>
<p>I, like all biology students, learned about HeLa cells early in my career, but I didn’t learn about Henrietta Lacks. They came from “Helen Lane”, we were told. Or maybe it was &#8220;Helene Lange&#8221;. It was a secret to protect the family of the woman, who died, or possibly survived. You see, Dr. Gey never got permission to use those cells and the family of Henrietta Lacks was never told.</p>
<p>I should note that nobody asked for permission to use biopsied tissue in those days. The term &#8220;informed consent&#8221; didn&#8217;t exist. Today, if you go in for surgery or any procedure where tissue samples are taken, you will sign a consent form. On most, if not all, of those forms, you give permission for the tissue (your cells) to be used for other purposes, even to develop commercial products, without compensation. Henrietta Lacks never signed such a form. It was only in 1973, when a scientist contacted Ms. Lacks&#8217; children to ask for blood samples to research, that the truth about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa cells was finally revealed. Even after that revelation, few people knew about Henrietta Lacks until the publication of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Immortal-Life-Henrietta-Lacks/dp/1400052181/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376234036&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+immortal+life+of+henrietta+lacks" target="_blank">The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</a> by <a href="http://rebeccaskloot.com/" target="_blank">Rebecca Skloot</a> in 2010.</p>
<p>I also must mention that Dr. Gey never made money off of the cells or from any of his contributions to science. He was a scientist of the old school where getting to spend your life researching the answers to questions about the world was the reward, not creating a &#8216;start up.&#8217; It is unclear whether he received a doctorate. His <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Otto_Gey" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> doesn&#8217;t mention it, while he is referred to as &#8220;Dr.&#8221; on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" target="_blank">Henrietta Lacks&#8217; Wikipedia page</a>. George Gey&#8217;s Wikipedia page also reports that when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer he had wanted some of his cells to be taken for scientific research. The surgeon didn&#8217;t comply and he was &#8220;furious&#8221; when he woke up from surgery.</p>
<p>HeLa cells, probably the most researched cell line in existence, were also the first cell line to have its genome <a href="http://g3journal.org/content/early/2013/03/26/g3.113.005777" target="_blank">completely sequenced</a> by scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. As is considered proper for scientific research, the results were made publically available so that other scientists could benefit from the work. When Henrietta Lacks’ descendants learned about this, they feared what the release of that genetic information might mean to the family, them and their children. To their credit, the research team at EMBL agreed to withdraw the results from public availability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health was due to be published in the highly prestigious journal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nature</span>. This publication was stopped. NIH Director Dr. Francis S. Collins and Deputy Director for science, outreach and policy Kathy L. Hudson made three separate trips to Baltimore to meet with the family. If I deem the descendants of Henrietta Lacks to be praiseworthy, it is because of what they sought and what they didn’t. They did not seek compensation and they did not seek to stop scientific progress. They only wanted to protect the family’s privacy and the ensure recognition for Henrietta. The agreement they reached should be a model for how the right to privacy and the needs of the research community can coexist. The NIH is establishing a HeLa Genome Data Access working group that will determine which scientists will have access to the genetic data. Both the European and the American sequencing data will be stored at the NIH and will be subject to review by this working group. Significantly, two of Henrietta’s descendants will sit on the board that makes these decisions.</p>
<p>The real legacy of Henrietta Lacks: cells that will live forever and enhance scientific research, and descendants that sought to ensure that the science continues while protecting the right to privacy of medical information. Of the two, we should be most thankful for the latter. I know I am.</p>

<p>“Nobody is trying to ban birth control, but I don’t see why I should have to buy insurance that includes that benefit if I don’t use it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me provide some counter-comments to the same topic:</p>
<p>Unintended pregnancy is a public health issue that affects all of society, not just a particular woman and her children.  Unintended pregnancies are more likely than planned pregnancies to have poor outcomes, like prematurity and low birth weight.  These problems impose health and financial burdens on individual families, and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Women who space their pregnancies by using contraception are more likely to have healthy children, and protect their own long-term health as well by conserving their calcium, iron, and other reserves.</p>
<p>In July 2011, the Institute of Medicine <a href="http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2011/Clinical-Preventive-Services-for-Women-Closing-the-Gaps/Preventive%20Services%20Women%202011%20Report%20Brief.pdf">issued a report</a>, <i>Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps </i>, recommending that preventive care should include the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive meth­ods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity (along with seven  other specific recommendations which have not been so politically controversial).</p>
<p>Unintended pregnancy has additional social costs, as well as health consequences.  Unintended pregnancy can interrupt educational goals—temporarily or permanently—resulting in lower lifetime achievement and earnings.  Unintended pregnancies can disrupt marriages and relationships, resulting in both emotional pain and financial hardship.  These effects fall not only on the most recent child, but can also have negative consequences for any children already in the family.</p>
<p>While most women can access some form of contraception at their own expense, the fact is that some of the most effective forms of contraception have high up-front costs.  Thus, many women are currently using a less effective, or less appropriate, form of contraception than what they might choose when all forms are fully covered by insurance.</p>
<p>In short, the societal goals of a healthy population and stable families are best served when childbearing is intentional, not accidental.  Contraception should be available with no copay for all women (and men!) for the same reason that childhood immunizations are covered:  because the benefits to public health far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>But the first order of business, and what seemed like the longest discussion, was on the issue of consumer fraud of Medicaid.  During the last legislative session, FSSA was asked how they monitor this kind of fraud, and because they could not answer the question well, they were told to have a report ready for this meeting.</p>
<p>To clarify, consumer fraud of Medicaid means one recipient defrauds the system.  An example given was a woman who had moved back into her husband’s house with her children, without informing her caseworker.  For this, she was jailed, and the state is attempting to recover $43,000 in health care expenses from her.  FSSA estimates the rate of consumer fraud of Medicaid to be 0.02%.  This means that of the more than 1 million Hoosiers who are on Medicaid, perhaps 250 of them have done something fraudulent in order to obtain healthcare.  I can’t tell you about provider fraud (such as home health care companies, providers, etc.) which accounts for many millions of dollars in fraudulent claims, because our legislators are apparently not interested in fraud perpetrated by businesses—just those individual Hoosiers who do things in order to get healthcare.</p>
<p>As the meeting went on, the angry diatribes on the part of the mostly white, male Republicans about cheating Hoosiers morphed into an attack on reduced and free lunches (let’s starve the children!).  One of them even admitted that to prove a point, when he registered his children for school he said his kids needed reduced price lunches, and nobody checked up on him!  And then, it morphed to reduced rental for text books, because the schools encourage both of these frauds so that they can get more money from the state to educate our children.</p>
<p>So what I learned about Hoosier civic values:  Access to healthcare is a privilege, and a healthy, well-fed, well-educated populace has no benefit to all Hoosiers, just to the selfish few who can afford access to these things.</p>

<p>It was a welcome bone thrown to the gay community and his timing could not have been any better given the marriage issue facing our community, but were his statements about his not wanting to judge gay priests aimed at soothing the wounds of the gay community?</p>
<p>Pastors and clergy have long understood the balancing act of touching the conscience without alienating the congregation, and the fact that gays and lesbians were not predominant in most religious communities has made speaking on the topic of homosexuality low-risk—until recently.  Increased visibility of the gay and lesbian community has pulled back the cloak that has covered a small but strong segment of the religious community and allowed friends and family to begin dialogue on the issue.  The issue that was once uniting in its unfamiliar, ‘freak-show’ way is now divisive as families and allies of gay and lesbian Catholics are speaking out.</p>
<p>While Catholic teaching is “Universal” by definition, the reality is that acceptance varies greatly depending on the congregation.  Perhaps some priests have a clearer understanding of the value of religious communities for all people, the value of all humans and choose to foster “inclusive” Catholic communities.  This is in spite of the fact that inclusion and acceptance is clearly not been the position of the Catholic Church.  In fact, the church allowed the gay community to become a convenient target when the reputation of the church had been stained by the inappropriate and illegal acts of priests.  The blurring of issues worked for awhile.</p>
<p>The Catholic community has been challenged by church doctrine that is conflicting and confusing on both an intellectual and emotional level when it comes to the gay community, and the current social climate for acceptance of same sex relationships has pushed Catholics who are attempting to reconcile with Church teachings on the issue.   The statements made by the Pope should not be mistaken as a change in doctrine, but as a politically wise attempt to unite a divided and conflicted church body and keep dollars in the coffers.</p>
<p>This is a baby step in the right direction for the Church, but really offers nothing for the gay and lesbian community and this is not likely to change.  It does, however, offer a grain of compassion for Catholics who are internally conflicted by this issue.  For too long, members of the church have been stuck in the smash between the politics of religion and the conscience of heart.  The Catholic Church, as well as other religious communities, can no longer afford to use the gay and lesbian community as the emotional diversion for those members who are unable to face their own ‘sin.’</p>
<p>The target has shifted and it is time for religious communities to acknowledge the four fingers that are pointing back at them as they judge.</p>

Today he is 14 months and I am happy to report, we are still breastfeeding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still breastfeeding for all the reasons I started in the first place—for the health of my baby and myself, for the comfort and nourishment that I can provide him and because it just feels right for us. As he grows bigger and gains more independence each day, it&#8217;s a wonderful privilege to be able to connect with my child in this way and know that I am still able to help his growing body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, breastfeeding a toddler is less socially acceptable than nursing a young baby. After his 1st birthday, the questions from friends and family started rolling in about our nursing relationship: &#8220;Have you weaned that baby yet?&#8221; and &#8220;How much longer will you be doing THAT?&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is, I can&#8217;t say when I will stop breastfeeding. Just like I couldn&#8217;t predict the day my baby would take his first steps or say his first words, I can&#8217;t predict the day when he will decide he&#8217;s all done with his mama&#8217;s milk. I&#8217;m ok with that, my partner is ok with that and I&#8217;m sure my son is ok with that.</p>
<p>I have learned along the way, that there are still so many health benefits for breastfeeding into the toddler years. As my toddler grows more independent and is around other children more, the antibodies in my breast milk will protect his immune system and keep him healthy. My milk provides 75% of his Vitamin A requirements, 43% of his needed protein and 36% of his calcium requirements. While he continues to explore and experiment with new foods every day, it is a comfort to know that we don&#8217;t have to worry about him getting enough calories from food and that he can learn to enjoy food at his own pace.</p>
<p>I still breastfeed because I know that one day I will be sad that my baby is a baby no longer. It is those moments when my busy baby comes to me, shows the sign for &#8220;milk&#8221; and smiles hugely at me when he&#8217;s satisfied that I will treasure forever.</p>

<blockquote><p>INDIANAPOLIS — Former Indiana and current Florida schools chief Tony Bennett built his national star by promising to hold &#8220;failing&#8221; schools accountable. But when it appeared an Indianapolis charter school run by a prominent Republican donor might receive a poor grade, Bennett&#8217;s education team frantically overhauled his signature &#8220;A-F&#8221; school grading system to improve the school&#8217;s marks.</p>
<p>Emails obtained by The Associated Press show Bennett and his staff scrambled last fall to ensure influential donor Christel DeHaan&#8217;s school received an &#8220;A,&#8221; despite poor test scores in algebra that initially earned it a &#8220;C.”</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to understand that anything less than an A for Christel House compromises all of our accountability work,&#8221; Bennett wrote in a Sept. 12 email to then-chief of staff Heather Neal, who is now Gov. Mike Pence&#8217;s chief lobbyist.</p>
<p>Bennett, who now is reworking Florida&#8217;s grading system as that state&#8217;s education commissioner, reviewed the emails Monday morning and denied that DeHaan&#8217;s school received special treatment. He said discovering that the charter would receive a low grade raised broader concerns with grades for other &#8220;combined&#8221; schools – those that included multiple grade levels – across the state.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Mr. Bennett didn’t think it was fair that one poor grade in one subject could doom a school to less public funds, and potentially harm the entire community by driving down property prices and driving families away.  Ignoring the delicious schadenfreude that Mr. Bennett designed this system to do just that, let’s take him at his word that he didn’t want to let one bad school hurt the whole system.  As long as he has evidence that this school was to be a special circumstance based solely on concern over the functioning of a newly implemented system, I think this could be forgiven.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, the emails clearly show Bennett&#8217;s staff was intensely focused on Christel House, whose founder has given more than $2.8 million to Republicans since 1998, including $130,000 to Bennett and thousands more to state legislative leaders.</p>
<p>Bennett estimated that 12 or 13 schools benefited, not just Christel House, but the emails show DeHaan&#8217;s charter was the catalyst for any changes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Bennett consistently cited Christel House as a top-performing school as he secured support for the measure from business groups and lawmakers, including House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tem David Long.</p></blockquote>
<p>So not only was Christel House ran by a MAJOR Republican donor, it was the very school that Bennett used as an example of why state lawmakers should support the more radical changes Bennett was proposing.</p>
<p>But, before this “changing the grades” idea gets overblown, maybe they were just tinkering around the margins, and trying to see how they could “massage” the statistics to bump up their grades slightly.  Would it be dishonest?  Kind of, but it wouldn’t be a scandal by any means.</p>
<blockquote><p>By Sept. 13, Gubera unveiled it was a 2.9, or a &#8220;C.&#8221;</p>
<p>A weeklong behind-the-scenes scramble ensued among Bennett, assistant superintendent Dale Chu, Gubera, Neal and other top staff at the Indiana Department of Education. They examined ways to lift Christel House from a &#8220;C&#8221; to an &#8220;A,&#8221; including adjusting the presentation of color charts to make a high &#8220;B&#8221; look like an &#8220;A&#8221; and changing the grade just for Christel House.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear from the emails exactly how Gubera changed the grading formula, but they do show DeHaan&#8217;s grade jumping twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like parting the Red Sea to get numbers to move that significantly,&#8221; Jeff Butts, superintendent of Wayne Township schools in Indianapolis, said in an interview with The Associated Press.</p></blockquote>
<p>And just how much was Bennett involved in this? Was it just an exuberant staff misinterpreting their supervisor’s wishes?  <i>[Bolding added by author for emphasis.]</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Yet Bennett wrote to staff twice in four days, directly inquiring about DeHaan&#8217;s status<b>. Gubera broke the news after the second note that &#8220;terrible&#8221; 10th grade algebra results had &#8220;dragged down their entire school.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Bennett called the situation &#8220;very frustrating and disappointing&#8221; in an email that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am more than a little miffed about this,&#8221; Bennett wrote<b>. &#8220;I hope we come to the meeting today with solutions and not excuses and/or explanations for me to wiggle myself out of the repeated lies I have told over the past six months.&#8221;</b></p></blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty damning.  More to the point, I don’t even know how to be snarky about this.  Not only was this school’s grade intentionally changed, it is clear it was a directive from Bennett himself, and that he knowingly lied to others about the grade in order to buy more time.</p>
<p>The saddest part of this is that Bennett, if he truly cared about education, could have used this situation to take a look at the system he designed—and I will submit no system is perfect from the get-go (such as Obamacare)—and then worked to modify the system so it was more flexible in its grading, and also by being flexible to more accurately represent a school’s quality on a holistic level.  Instead he chose to lie to keep in place a system that could cause one school’s 10<sup>th</sup> grade algebra scores to not only potentially harm that school’s funding and future, but also harm that school’s community and all other schools involved in the comparison, <i>as evidenced by Bennett’s own admission.</i></p>
<p>And that’s what’s truly sad about the education reform movement.  I don’t think anyone would disagree that our education system needs to be reformed on various levels.  The reform movement could use their ideas—which I submit, while many are flawed, there are a few ideas worth exploring—as a starting point to try to see what works, what doesn’t, and modify the system on an ongoing basis (again, see Obamacare).  Instead, like lowering taxes and deregulation, it has become another Republican gospel, and any evidence that belies their faith must be covered up.</p>

<p>The Pence Administration’s refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has already had a devastating impact upon Hoosiers. According to a February <a href="https://www.statereforum.org/sites/default/files/iha_unmc_indiana_medicaid_expansion_report.pdf" target="_blank">2013 policy brief</a> developed with the support of the Indiana Hospital Association, Indiana’s opposition to Medicaid expansion will leave more than 400,000 Hoosiers without health insurance. The estimated cost of expanding Medicaid to provide insurance to those 400,000 Hoosiers is a half a billion dollars, while the estimated revenue that would come to the State from the federal government by 2020 and which will now be forfeited is more than 20 times that amount ($10.45 billion).</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress have frequently claimed that the ACA will cause insurance costs for average Americans to skyrocket.  Recently a spokesman for the Pence Administration, its Department of Insurance chief deputy commissioner Logan Patrick Harrison, misleadingly announced that Hoosiers will see a huge increase in insurance premiums under the ACA. That claim has since been thoroughly debunked by <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/07/28/4196466/health-care-battle-fraught-with.html" target="_blank">independent observers</a>, who say Pence’s numbers were “an incredible simplification of an incredibly complex topic.”</p>
<p>Who is Logan Patrick Harrison?  It turns out he’s a 2007 graduate of IU Indianapolis Law School who was recruited by Mitch Daniels to work with Tony Bennett on educational policies. In 2010 Harrison published a book about his educational reform ideas, “Straight Ahead, As Usual: Education Reforms Put Simply,” a book Harrison describes as “highly critical of the current education model” and in which he urges the adoption of private school vouchers and praises Daniels and Bennett as exemplars of public education “reform.”</p>
<p>What is not clear is how Harrison became an alleged expert in the field of <i>public</i> education, given that he is a product of parochial elementary and high schools in Indianapolis and did not attend any public school until entering college.</p>
<p>What is even less certain is how, apart from serving as the mouthpiece of the Pence Administration, Harrison now qualifies as an expert in assessing the ACA’s impact upon the insurance premiums Hoosiers pay.</p>
<p>Hoosiers should be alarmed that the Pence Administration would allow a deeply partisan lawyer with no discernible expertise in health care policy to serve as a spokesperson regarding that issue.  And they should be incensed that he would use misleading numbers that are deliberately designed to inflate the ACA’s actual costs and to ignore the substantial savings and benefits the vast majority of Hoosiers will realize after the ACA is fully implemented.  After all, at his inauguration Pence swore an oath to faithfully carry out the law, and Obamacare is now the law of the land.</p>
<p>Gov. Pence knows (but won’t tell you) that after years of his political party publicly tearing it down, challenging it in court, and holding some 40 futile votes to repeal it, the ACA is likely to lower rather than raise health insurance premiums for most Hoosiers and expand health insurance coverage to many Hoosiers currently without health insurance, and even more if and when Pence finally agrees to Medicaid expansion.  But Pence, like so many of his fellow Republicans, apparently still believes he must do everything in his power to sabotage the ACA before it takes full effect, which includes lying to and misleading his constituents in order to weaken Its public support.</p>
<p>If the ACA is allowed to fulfill its promise to expand health insurance coverage to the uninsured, bring down health care costs, create jobs and improve the economy, Republican politicians who have tied their political fortunes to defeating Obamacare will be thoroughly discredited and will suffer the political consequences.  But political consequences aside, there is still no reason for Gov. Pence and his spokesman to make false and misleading statements about Obamacare which, despite Republicans’ best efforts to kill it, is now the law of the land and if given the opportunity can and will provide a better quality of life to thousands of Hoosiers who are either too sick or too poor to get the health coverage they need and deserve.</p>

<p>On my way to work yesterday, I noticed the right lane blocked at College and Westfield—again. Looking at what was going on while waiting for the light to change, I noticed a man with a jackhammer breaking up the sidewalk—the newly poured sidewalk, less than a month old. This isn’t the first time I’ve seen newly poured sidewalks or newly paved streets being ripped up and it probably won’t be the last. You just think that someone should have planned better.</p>
<p>Then at work today, it was a déjà vu moment. In the middle of the code I was changing was a ‘date function’—actually two of them that used dates to determine ages. The first was the Y2K fix put into the code in 1999 (remember the Y2K scare?) and the second—a fix for the Y2K fix completed in 2001. You see, although everyone knew it was coming, both the private sector and the public sector waited until the last minute to fix this issue. Therefore many of the fixes were “quick and dirty”, temporary fixes that bought 5, 10 or 20 years. Having taken a deep breath, more rational, permanent fixes were made. Again, you just think that someone should have planned better.</p>
<p>On my lunch break, there was yet <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/25/19680812-watchdog-sharply-critical-of-afghan-justice-training-program?lite" target="_blank">another news report</a> on the lack of oversight in a privatized government program, this one in Afghanistan. As I reflected on this and the notion that the private sector is always more ‘efficient’ than the public sector, I started to calculate the extreme wastefulness of the Y2K years, although it did get me into a new career in IT. Based on the billing rates that I know were prevalent then, and what I was told about the previous rates, I think the figure is in the tens of billions of dollars wasted nation-wide by the private sector alone.</p>
<p>On my return home, I continued a small project I have going, converting my VHS tapes to DVD. Some of these are home recordings, but most are movies I bought in the ‘excess inventory’ bins in various video rental stores. If you remember, Hollywood hated the idea of the VCR and wanted them to be banned by the government (they were more successful controlling DVD players). Hollywood failed and a booming business ensued. It allowed many ‘Mom &amp; Pop’ video stores to thrive (before Blockbuster put most of them under) and let Hollywood make a lot of money off of box office flops and some ‘direct to video&#8217; movies that never saw the inside of a theater. Fortunately, Hollywood didn’t plan better and a multi-billion dollar industry was born. While DVDs, often with “extra features”, have displaced video cassettes, this part of the industry really began because Hollywood’s idea of  &#8217;protecting&#8217; their property lost out. In this case, we can’t say somebody planned better, but somebody did have a better plan.</p>
