How about being a student and also being a business owner? Sounds stressful, time consuming, and difficult, but Morgan Purcell makes it look incredibly easy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I met Morgan when I made a trip to her frozen yogurt business, Cultured Swirl. Cultured Swirl sells frozen yogurt in Fountain Square. But what sets them apart from other frozen yogurt joints is their all natural yogurt. And let me tell you, it’s working for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I found out Morgan was a twenty-something herself, I asked if I could sit down with her and learn what it’s like to be a business owner, a college student, and a twenty-something all at once.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The biggest challenge for Morgan is that she is still working on her education. She doesn’t have a degree in business and has had to learn everything by experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think at our age we’re just super busy. We’re pulled in different directions because we aren’t actually in our careers yet,” she said. Were there ever truer words spoken?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Morgan’s family also owns a fiber optic business in the Indy area, but her father had always had dreams of owning a restaurant. They decided that the frozen yogurt craze was their chance at dipping their toe in the restaurant business water.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This was a new exciting adventure that I could jump on board with,” said Morgan. She took it upon herself to make the Purcell family dream a reality. She began comparing real estate prices, making appointments with potential architects, and doing hours and hours of research.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After two years of hard work and effort, Cultured Swirl opened on April 19, 2013.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cultured Swirl is a true family business with true family values. “I wish people could see that we actually care about people on a real level instead of just to make money. We actually care about them. They aren’t just numbers,” said Morgan during our interview.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Besides being a business owner Morgan loves to ride her three horses and play video games. She is the only daughter with one older brother and one younger brother. “Growing up I did not have Barbie dolls. I had GI Joes and watched Ninja Turtles,” said Morgan with a laugh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I asked Morgan what advice she had for aspiring twenty-something business owners. “Other people have tried to walk all over me because of my age. You have to be confident in yourself,” she said. “And take risks, but be careful about your risks.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Boys will become men.</strong> First of all, what does this even mean? How are high school senior boys expected to just magically mature and become someone worth spending time with over a span of 3 months? Ridiculous. Doesn’t happen. Boys will be boys.  Also what do you mean by MEN? Like, older? Or more mature? Or they have chest hair or something? Doesn’t matter that they are now in college. I think this might make it even worse. Oh coooooool, you drink alcohol. WHO DOESN’T WHEN THEY’RE IN COLLEGE? Well, I guess I didn’t. But the point is, maturity is about a lot more than just going to away to college.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I will develop a sense of style.</strong> No. I always used to look at college girls in awe. They just seemed so put together. So effortlessly hip. THIS IS A LIE, MAGAZINES AND TV SHOWS EVERYWHERE. It was a struggle to brush my hair most mornings.  One time I went 3 weeks without shaving my legs. I know, that’s gross. But it’s REALITY. Still waiting for my fashion sense to come…and I’ve been a college graduate for 3 months now.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I would begin to enjoy drinking coffee.</strong> Uh. No. Coffee didn’t just magically stop tasting like vinegar and grass overnight. It still tastes terrible and I still can’t drink it. I don’t care how tired I am, I just kind of walk around falling over sidewalks and stuff and no matter how many times I run into things- still can’t enjoy coffee. Doesn’t happen.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I would totally develop a life plan.</strong> Nope. Still no plan. Still no idea what the next 5 years will hold. Still no idea what I want to do with my life. Still trying to figure out who I am. Still trying to figure out math. Still trying to figure out why American Idol and Glee are things. Still spend more time on Pinterest than I could ever imagine spending on developing a life plan or than I ever spent studying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I would learn how to study.</strong> That was a cute joke that I had in my head in high school. I still struggle to study and I don’t even have to do it anymore. (JK, GRAD SCHOOL.) Here’s a true story; when I was a sophomore in college I actually watched a YouTube video on how to take good notes and be successful when studying. While watching said video I got bored after 4 minutes. I couldn’t even study and take notes on a video of how to study and take notes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I would become some independent woman cooking meals and budgeting my finances.</strong> THIS IS A LIE. I lived in an apartment and in a single dorm with a kitchen for 3 years and I still don’t know how to cook. I mean, obviously this is completely my fault because I’ve never bothered to try after the one time that I caught my oven on fire. But going to college and living on your own doesn’t mean you magically learn how to cook. Also, it definitely doesn’t mean you learn how to budget. You know what makes you learn how to budget? Trying to buy a 12$ dress and getting your card declined. That makes you learn how to budget. Not college.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I honestly thought that by the time I graduated college I would totally understand how taxes work.</strong> Why would I even think this is a thing that could happen? Have you ever actually tried to to calculate your taxes? Don’t spend too much time thinking about taxes or you’ll end up crying yourself to sleep. Looks like I’ll be finding someone to help me with my taxes for the rest of my life.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I thought that being in college would make me start watching more MSNBC and CNN and less reality TV.</strong> Wrong. Sometimes I just really like to watch someone else’s life for a bit, okay? So sue me. Catfish is interesting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I thought that by the end of college I would want to settle down.</strong> I just cringed. Legitmately cringed while typing that. Settling down just sounds like settling to me. I’ve got dreams, I’ve got things to see and spending four years at college didn’t make me any closer to becoming a housewife.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>And finally, I thought that when the time came to graduate I would feel super ready and not scared at all and totally prepared for the real world.</strong> Nope. Pretty scared of the real world. The real world is a place where you have to pay back loans, you have to budget in order to survive, you have to pay lots of taxes, and you can’t just skip your 8 a.m. meeting because you stayed up too late watching Netflix. The real world might be ready and waiting, but I’m still not ready for it.</p>
<p>So here’s to the last four years and all the things I thought would happen that didn’t…Maybe by the time I’m 25.</p>

<p>It was an unseasonably cool Saturday. The sun was shining; large picturesque clouds filled the sky. The birds were singing songs that would make Adele jealous. Why was this day so beautiful? I was about to experience brunch for the first time.</p>
<p>Like most people, my first brunch experience occurred on my way to a NASCAR race with my three friends. My excitement was palpable as I climbed into my friend&#8217;s Prius.

As they looked at me like I had two heads, they assured me I was making the right decision. If you are experiencing brunch for the first time, here are some things that I wished I knew going in:</p>
<p><strong>There doesn’t have to be cantaloupe.</strong></p>
<p>I assumed that when someone ordered brunch some form of a melon accompanied it. Boy was I wrong. I was so wrong our server said, “Oh, bless his heart!” If you don’t want to be mocked at brunch, don’t make this mistake. Oh, and Shelia? I will have my vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>You CAN bro out at Brunch.</strong></p>
<p>Ok, you’re a single dude whether by choice or “people just don’t understand you” (It’s ok! We still love you!). Families and couples have unfairly monopolized brunch for years. I’m here today, putting my mancard on the line, to say it’s okay and encouraged to bro out at brunch. Not only is the food delicious, but also it gives you an opportunity to catch up in an environment that doesn’t involve a dimly lit bar. Men, it’s time we take brunch back.</p>
<p><strong>Fedoras and sunglasses, ladies.</strong></p>
<p>Have a long night of unplanned partying at Rock Lobster? Maybe you “just can’t” shower in the morning? Do you want to dodge the local paparazzi as you enjoy Italian Biscuits and Mimosa’s with your besties? Fedoras and sunglasses are for you! Now you don’t have to limit your hat selection to a fedora, but it appeared to be a popular choice. Brunch doesn’t have to be a formal affair, let your fun side show!</p>
<p><strong>Check yourself before your wreck yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Remember, people do use brunch as a family outing. You don’t need to yell your exploits from downtown or Broad Ripple from the night before across the table. I know it was hilarious when you did that thing with that person in that place, but do you really want to have the parents of the three year old sitting in ear shot of you explain it to them on the drive home? I can be guilty of this too, just remember where you are and who’s around you and use your inside voice.</p>
<p>Brunch, I’m impressed with you. Now I understand the hype and bought into it. If any restaurant needs a spokesperson/hypeman for their brunch, I will bring my megaphone and reggae horn and spread the good word of brunch until I am hoarse. If you’re an avid brunch attendee, keep up the good work! If you haven’t been to brunch, or aren’t a believer – call me. We’ll change that!</p>
<p>Oh, and the race? Tune in next time…</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"> Several months ago, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation/">Parks and Recreation</a> came to Indianapolis to film a scene for their Indiana-based television show. I got wind of this, and I immediately went into stalker mode. Ron Motherf*ckin Swanson was going to be in Indianapolis? No way. Adam Scott AKA ‘Abs’ from Step Brothers?! You’re killing me. Rob Lowe…at St. Elmo’s Steakhouse? Oh, now THAT’s a coincidence. After Twitter stalking for hours, I made my way downtown. As fate would have it, I stumbled upon them shooting their live Parks and Rec scene right in front of St. Elmo&#8217;s. Afterwards, the crew stayed back to meet the fans and here is where I completely blew it…</span></span></span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">I did not say one word to Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson) when I got my chance to meet him. I gave my phone to someone, stood by him, smiled and walked away. I don’t even think I made eye contact. Although it was never my intention, I totally used and disrespected Mr. Offerman by not treating him like a normal human being.</span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whether it’s nerves, excitement, anxiety or just astonishment, that moment made me feel like I had been in the Twilight Zone. That is not how I act in everyday life. This got me thinking about how important it is to treat ‘celebrities’ like regular people, because that&#8217;s exactly what they are. I only wanted that stupid picture to begin with so I would have proof that I met him. I wanted to make everyone jealous (and it totally worked), but to me, the picture meant nothing because we made no connection.</p>
<p>My next celebrity sighting occurred when I was walking downtown the week the Indy 500 was going on. Gavin Degraw was having a free concert so my friend and I thought…’Why not?’. We were meandering downtown when I see him walking down the street&#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Me: “Dude, that’s Gavin Degraw.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Friend: “No it’s not. Wait, is it? No…oh my god I think it is.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Me: “That’s totally him. Who else wears a fedora in Indianapolis? Go say something.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Friend: “No. You say something.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Me: “No, I don’t even like him. You go.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Friend: “NO, you.”</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">This turns into a heated argument between my friend and I.  We did not meet him, but yet again, I felt like I had been abducted by aliens those few minutes after a celebrity entered my radar. Why did I care so much?! Before then, I couldn’t have told you one other song he sang besides the theme from One Tree Hill. </span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"> I vow to never ask a celebrity for a picture again or talk to a celebrity just because they’re a celebrity. Next time I see a famous person, or anyone I admire for that matter, I’m going to treat them like I would a new friend. Have you ever wondered how people befriend their mentors, celebrities or heroes? Simple, they treat them the same way as they would treat anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>1) Justin Beiber is the Worst and Here&#8217;s Why.</strong></p>
<p>There was an incident this week that involved Beiber, but did not involve a monkey of defiling a former president. Let&#8217;s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a concert this week, the Biebs asked the audience to stop throwing things, onto the stage, at him. <strong><em>FAIR.</em></strong></li>
<li>Then someone threw their smartphone up to him. Which irritated him. <strong><em>FAIR.</em></strong></li>
<li>Then he took the phone, stuck it down his pants, rubbed it around and handed it back to some random fan. <strong><em>NO LONGER FAIR.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2) Spice Girls + 9inch heels + Street Dancing = Fab. Fab. Fabulous Gay Men.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m legitimately not sure what to say other than, I started watching this video from French choreographer after seeing it on Jezebel. Then I spent the next 45 minutes watching his various other dances on YouTube. I just don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s not to love about this.</p>

<p>In other news- Minnesota passed Gay Marriage Wednesday night and <a href="http://jezebel.com/the-first-gay-couples-who-got-married-in-minnesota-will-987789941">things like this</a> happened. It was endearing- at least until their next natural disaster which some ass clown will be blaming on the sweet couples from the land of lakes.</p>
<p><strong>3) Anthony Weiner Gets Some Wicked Advice from Kristin Chenoweth</strong></p>
<p>As Anthony Weiner spent another week refusing to drop out of the NYC mayoral race and his chat room chick made the rounds of Howard Stern, Kristin Chenoweth took some time out of her busy schedule to give some advice on how to be &#8220;Popular.&#8221;</p>

<p>*Apparently if you are a straight man who doesn&#8217;t like musical theater, this video looses some of its luster. This is what MF demonstrated, when he got about 25 seconds into the video and began speaking to me slowly, like I&#8217;d lost my mind.</p>

<li>In other Presidential news- <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/07/obama-honors-ncaa-womens-basketball-champion-uconn-169632.html">the Lady Huskies made a visit to the White House this week to meet President Obama and one of the players gave him bunny ears.</a> <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/collegebasketball/story/u-conn-women-give-president-obama-bunny-ears-in-photo-op-073113">This apparently caused an uproar, although as far as I can tell, only within the walls of Fox News. </a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/08/01/cory-monteith-tribute-glee-to-address-addiction/">Fox this week announced that Glee (the show everyone stopped watching after season 2) would address Cory Monteith&#8217;s death in a special episode dealing with drug abuse</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.hypable.com/2013/08/01/glee-season-6-final-season-fox/">they shared that the show probably wouldn&#8217;t continue after Season 6.</a> And the world tried really hard to muster a care.</li>
<li>On the subject of  cancellations- <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/247450/goodbye-bunheads">The Amy Sherman Palladino show Bunheads was officially canceled from ABC Family this week</a>. It was sad- the show was a bright spot in a land of trashy teen dramas that ABC Family has become oh so good at.</li>

<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><a href="http://jezebel.com/teenage-exorcists-explain-the-dangers-of-sexually-tra-979711935">Vice&#8217;s new documentary &#8220;Teenage Exorcists&#8221; is a sort of crazy that you would expect if ABC Family and the 700 Club had a bizarre, confused child.</a> Touring the country, saving people from &#8220;Sexually Transmitted Demons&#8221; (for real) these girls have some words of wisdom including, &#8221;Satan can&#8217;t just go into anybody that he wants to. He has to have a legal right.&#8221; It&#8217;s weirdddddd. </span></li>

<p><strong>5) Simon Cowell Banged his Friend&#8217;s Wife or Something.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, I think the X-Factor judge could pull a Shaggy (Wasn&#8217;t Me) except apparently the birth control memo proved tricky and the Wife is knocked up.</p>
<p>And according to divorce papers, Wifey is 10 weeks preggers. Plus-  Cowell is actually named in the divorce papers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twentysomethingindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image6.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" alt="Corn" src="http://www.twentysomethingindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>When I think corn, the seemingly endless fields along Indiana farmland doesn&#8217;t come to mind as quickly as my personal favorites: corn on the cob, cornbread and corn salsa. Corn is versatile and can be added to just about anything for subtly added sweetness. Little known fact? Traditional corn on the cob is typically considered a vegetable &#8212; but dried corn, like popcorn, is considered a grain.</p>
<p>The other &#8220;golden kernel&#8221; worth mentioning? The cost. Corn, especially in Indiana, is one of the most affordable produce selections as summer ends. You&#8217;ll probably find it at your grocery store for less than $1 a piece &#8212; and probably an even better deal at the Farmers Market, where I recently paid $3 for seven ears that lasted me all of two days. (I like corn.)</p>
<p>My quick tips for my favorites: Add paprika to your corn on the cob for some extra flavor; corn salsa isn&#8217;t corn salsa without green chiles; and the best cornbread is made with bacon grease. Sounds gross, but don&#8217;t blame me when your dry cornbread has no flavor&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twentysomethingindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image_11.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1985" alt="Peaches" src="http://www.twentysomethingindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image_11.jpeg" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>The best part? You can consider it a veggie serving and go for dessert &#8212; peachy. There isn&#8217;t much better than an insanely juicy peach at the end of the summer &#8212; they&#8217;re probably one of the only hairy things I truly love.</p>
<p>Picking a pile of peaches for your pack? Go for those that are slightly soft (too hard peaches have little flavor and none of that juice I&#8217;ve been harping on) but not badly bruised (and they&#8217;re easy to bruise). They taste better at room temperature (like tomatoes) so keep them out of the fridge.</p>
<p>My go-to&#8217;s? Sliced peaches sprinkled with cinnamon and warmed in the microwave; peach cobbler made with granola instead of oats; and peach-yogurt smoothies with a splash of vanilla, perfect post-workout.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Stock up on corn and peaches on your next trip to the market &#8212; you can&#8217;t miss them!</p>

<p><strong>2) Yummy. Yummy. Yummy. I LOVE IT.</strong></p>
<p>This gem is about a week behind- I know. Don&#8217;t start. But I&#8217;ve spent entirely too much time this week listening to Robin Thicke&#8217;s cover of Icona Pop&#8217;s I Love It- over and over and over. Who knew that a tune from my workout playlist could be so damn&#8230; sexy.</p>
<p><strong>Original </strong></p>

<p><strong>YUUUUMMMMMMY. </strong></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YJbF5EMyJsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really only seems fair that Thicke&#8217;s version is so much better, considering Clinton&#8217;s version of Blurred Lines is better than anything by Robin Thicke.</p>

<p><strong>3) Porn, Porn vs. Lady Porn. </strong></p>
<p>With the Indy Film Fest wrapping up this weekend, I could not be more excited for the final night screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2229499/">Don Jon</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6615kYTpOSU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#8217;s directoral debut, this movie seems to beg the question- Is man fantasy, really all that different from woman fantasy? Plus I&#8217;m a big fan of all the casting- Tony Danza, Julianne Moore, even Scarlett Johansson minus the Jersey accent. Can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p><strong>4) Awww&#8230; Shucks.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a moment of bipartisan sweetness, with George H. W. Bush&#8217;s decision to shave his head, in support of the son of a member of Bush&#8217;s secret service team. The 2-year-old son had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and after undergoing treatment, lost much of his hair. <a href="http://jezebel.com/george-bush-shaves-head-in-solidarity-with-2-year-old-c-908306394">And despite the fact that the pictures sort of look like a kid posing with with a crazy bald old man, the intention is all sorts of endearing.</a></p>
<p><strong>5) Nerdy New News. </strong></p>
<p>This will be in two parts, designed to make you less stabby. You ready?</p>
<ul>
<li>Part One: The Bad.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/ryan-gosling-zac-efron-star-wars.html">It is rumored that Ryan Gosling and Zac Efron are slated to be in the next Star Wars movie.</a> On behalf of everyone, everywhere, that is not a middle school girl, the answer is&#8230; No. Stop It. Now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part Two: The Maybe Still Not So Great.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/23/comic-con-man-of-steel-sequel-likely-called-batman-vs-superman">There was confirmation at Comic Con that there does indeed appear to be a Batman/Superman movie in the works.</a> Also- <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/tyler-hoechlin-batman_n_3646699.html">Tyler Hoechlin is rumored to be up for Batman, since Christian Bale has said- No more. </a></p>
<ul>
<li>Part Three: The Much Better.</li>
</ul>
<p>No one thinks to themselves- you know what would be glamorous, or, you know, interesting? City County Council.</p>
<p>But have no fear- a town in Canada is read to prove you differently, <a href="http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Whitehorse+city+council+over/8682091/story.html">with a piece of cinematography</a> that, at the very least, tops the hell out of The Green Lantern. Take notes Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>The end- Have a lovely week all!</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-53185e0b-189b-4053-27a6-87542bcff47b">Imagine being an aspiring singer songwriter still in college at Ball State University who happens to have a run in with a famous rapper’s, Wale, record label in a Atlanta night club. Fast-forward to today: you now have over 40,000 followers on twitter, a billboard chart topping song, and a record deal with Interscope records. Seems like a dream doesn’t it? But for homegrown Hoosier and triple threat, Tiara Thomas, it’s a reality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Indianapolis native has always been attracted to music and determined to make her mark. She’s a self-taught guitar player, after all. It was during her high school years she began to perfect her sound both vocally and instrumentally. Sharing her talent at local open mic nights and talent shows in the area. Thomas graduated from Lawrence North and went on to attend Ball State University where she majored in Telecommunications and Production. While in college she continued to cultivate her own musical style through music covers: a mix of raw acoustics, soulful vocals, and cutting hip-hop/pop lyrics. Her unique sound and intelligent arrangements began to gather a loyal fan base.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2009, Thomas attended a Wale concert where she exchanged information with Wale’s production team. She later sent them samples of her work and later was featured on the track “The Cloud.” The feature held true to Thomas’ earlier work, stripped down acoustics with sexy vocals. Her name trended worldwide on Twitter and she soon found herself face to face with overnight fame. The duo went on to record the hit single “Bad,” which Thomas wrote while at college in Muncie, Indiana.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SxpWpLHCiYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">The song was released as the first single off of Wale’s third studio album, The Gifted. “Bad” went on to receive extensive radio play across the nation and made its mark third on Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs. The sultry acoustics and vocals by Thomas paired with the slow R&amp;B beat and Wale’s rap verses became an undeniable hit. The single climbed the Billboard charts to peak at the 21st spot. It marks Wale’s second appearance on the Billboard Top 40 and Thomas’ first.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this summer Thomas released her first solo single, “4 Doller Bill.” The single strays away from the acoustically driven sound previously showcased by Thomas and takes a more hip-hop driven approach ready for the clubs. Thomas’ voice continues to shine on the track about gold diggers and even makes her rapping debut. The single serves as the first promotional track off of her debut EP Dear Sallie Mae due out later this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s only the beginning for Thomas so keep an eye out for what this Indy native artist has to offer.</p>

Indy&#8217;s young professionals non-profit, IndyHub, has just the solution you need. Next week on August 31 at the City Market, IndyHub will be presenting &#8220;Get IndyVolved,&#8221; a showcase of dozens of Indianapolis organizations that is geared specifically toward 20- and 30- somethings looking for places to plug into the city. The annual event is a casual format with representatives from volunteer and professional organizations all over the city manning tables around the market. You have the opportunity to talk one-on-one with peers about different opportunities available, ask questions and learn more about things happening in Indy. I attended the event last year and was impressed with the number of exhibitors there (over 70!). Organizations in attendance last year included professional associations, volunteer groups and boards as well as community organizations in need of volunteers.

Indy&#8217;s young professionals non-profit, <a href="http://www.indyhub.org">IndyHub</a>, has just the solution you need.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next week on August 31 at the City Market, IndyHub will be presenting &#8220;Get IndyVolved,&#8221; a showcase of dozens of Indianapolis organizations that is geared specifically toward 20- and 30- somethings looking for places to plug into the city.</div>
<p>The annual event is a casual format with representatives from volunteer and professional organizations all over the city manning tables around the market. You have the opportunity to talk one-on-one with peers about different opportunities available, ask questions and learn more about things happening in Indy.</p>
<p>I attended the event last year and was impressed with the number of exhibitors there (over 70!). Organizations in attendance last year included professional associations, volunteer groups and boards as well as community organizations in need of volunteers. I consider myself well-versed in Indianapolis activities but was excited to get to know several new organizations that I wasn&#8217;t familiar with.</p>
<p>If you haven’t connected with IndyHub yet, you have to check out their website and subscribe to their e-newsletter as soon as possible. IndyHub’s mission is to help young professionals become a part of Indianapolis by offering regular happy hour networking events at cool locations across the city and other IndyHub sponsored events. If you sign up for the e-newsletter they also promote tons of other activities that appeal to 20-somethings across the city! I can’t tell you how many times I discovered a fun event was happening because of the IndyHub e-newsletter.</p>
<p>Get IndyVolved starts at 5 p.m. next Wednesday, which makes it the perfect stop on your way home from work. Just <a href="http://indyhub.org/ai1ec_event/get-indyvolved/">visit the event website to register for the free event</a> and I hope to see you there!</p>
