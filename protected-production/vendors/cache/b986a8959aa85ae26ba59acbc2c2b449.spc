<p>Steve, Judy,</p>
<p>You’ll never guess who accepts water filters for recycling. <a href="www.recycleforce.org" target="_blank">RecycleForce</a>! The plastic is likely either #5 or #2 and, once it’s separated from the filtering material, it can be recycled with other plastics. It’s best if you shake off the excess water, let it dry for a few days and wrap it up in a bag before taking it to be recycled.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="http://www.brita.com/using-your-brita/recycle-your-filter/" target="_blank">Brita pitcher filter</a>, it can be recycled at a Whole Foods Gimme 5 drop-off.</p>

<p><em>What is the trade off of disposing of presently functioning incandescent or halogen light bulbs and replacing them with compact fluorescent or LED bulbs?</em></p>
<p><em> — Ray</em></p>
<p>Ray,</p>
<p>I used a lifeline and contacted a friend on this one. Actually, I asked my favorite lighting expert, my dad, and a local lighting retailer, ABI® Lighting Solutions.</p>
<p>Dad, who’s never at a loss for a clever quip, started by saying, “Basically the question is like the proverbial dental question about what teeth should you floss&#8230;floss only the teeth you want to keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and ABI agree that it makes sense to replace a functioning incandescent lamp when you want to start saving energy and reduce your electric bill.</p>
<p>You might continue using a working incandescent if the initial cost of buying replacement CFL or LED lamps is a concern, or if it is the heating season.</p>
<p>The CFL and LED replacement options immediately save energy and therefore, electricity costs, but the replacement lamps cost more initially.</p>
<p>Margaret from ABI shared this:</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s think of it this way: over the lifetime of one 10W LED bulb, you would need thirty 60W incandescent bulbs. In addition, you would be saving $131 in energy by switching to LED! Your monthly savings in energy would be $3.69, much more than the cost of one incandescent bulb.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, during the summer months, incandescent bulbs occur additional costs through air conditioning (85+% of the energy used to power incandescent bulbs is lost to heat and other forms of light not on the visible spectrum, whereas LEDs target only visual light and minimal heat is produced).</em></p>
<p><em>Though CFLS are much more energy-efficient than incandescent and halogen bulbs, they do contain toxic mercury and need to be taken to a tox drop. The prices of LEDs, the most efficient technology, have come down a lot in recent years and are now an affordable option that usually pay for themselves within a year or two.</em></p>
<p>Piece out,</p>
<p>Renee, Dad and Margaret</p>

<p>Hi Sue!</p>
<p>Welcome to the other side. I wish I had a more positive answer to your first question, but the recycling center will reject your magnets like two north poles coming together. In other words, no, magnets are not recyclable.</p>
<p>They can, however, be repurposed or reused.</p>
<p>-       tape the non-magnetic side to your office wall and use it to hold paperclips</p>
<p>-       keep one in your sewing kit to collect needles and pins</p>
<p>-       keep one in your tool box to hold screws while assembling/disassembling things</p>
<p>-       transform magnets with pictures from magazines or family photos</p>
<p>-       create your own alphabet magnets for the kids in your life</p>
<p>Piece out,</p>

<p><i>Darcy</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Darcy,</p>
<p>In searching for ways to recycle drywall, I keep running into walls. I’ll try to attack your question from three directions.</p>
<p>First, is drywall recyclable? YES! It’s very recyclable. Drywall is approximately 93% gypsum and 7% paper. In the Midwest, it is best reused as a soil amendment for farmers. It can also be recycled into new drywall, cement and other commercial products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Second, how can you recycle it here? That’s the challenge! I found one guy, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/roysrecycling/" target="_blank">Roy’s Recycling</a>, who will pick up new construction trimmings for a fee and sell it to farmers (thanks for the referral, Frank of <a href="http://www.castaliahomes.com/" target="_blank">Castalia Homes</a>). He is not able to take used drywall – only scrap from new drywall. Ironically, one of the leading suppliers of gypsum for agriculture was founded in Indiana.</p>
<p>Finally, is drywall bad for the environment when not recycled? Yes. Without getting too technical, if drywall gets wet, sulfate from the gypsum dissolves and can leach into our groundwater. In wet, anaerobic conditions (like a landfill), drywall produces hydrogen sulfide, a stinky, rotten egg-smelling gas.</p>

<p id="E28">Now in its 157th year, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/statefair/fair/" target="_blank">Indiana State Fair</a> is not only a source of pride for Hoosiers but also an opportunity to showcase talent and innovation from around the state. And this year, the State Fair is looking to expand its usual agricultural showcase of animals and support a more encompassing view of the agricultural industry by promoting farmers, artisans, chefs, and of course, food.</p>
<p id="E35">Launched last year, the State Fair’s effort to present Indiana food is housed in the 16,000-square foot <a href="http://www.in.gov/statefair/fair/entertainment/food_pavilion.html" target="_blank">DuPont Food Pavilion</a> near the Midway arch on the fairgrounds. The building is divided into three parts with Purdue University’s <a href="https://mdc.itap.purdue.edu/wk_group.asp?wk_group=USDA-MyPlate" target="_blank">MyPlate</a> taking up a substantial area. MyPlate will focus on nutrition and overall wellness in relation to food and food consumption and is geared toward kids with several interactive exhibits including a play. In addition to the exhibits, Purdue’s section will offer information on how to make healthy eating choices at home, restaurants, grocery stores, and even the fair!</p>
<p id="E46">In the middle of the pavilion sits the <a href="http://www.hoosiersmarket.com/" target="_blank">Hoosier Market</a>, a retail store that sells value-added food products from across the state and includes everything from marshmallows to salsas. “Big companies, small companies, a lot of them are Indiana artisan companies,” said Brian Blackford, a program manager for the <a href="http://www.in.gov/sfc/" target="_blank">Indiana State Fair Commission</a>. “… They range from <a href="http://www.sbchocolate.com/" target="_blank">South Bend Chocolate Company</a> to <a href="http://www.redgold.com/" target="_blank">Red Gold</a> down to <a href="http://frittlecandy.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Frittle Candy Company</a>.” Blackford said that thanks to the Indiana Grown <a href="http://www.in.gov/ocra/2342.htm" target="_blank">initiative</a> a program from the state <a href="http://www.in.gov/isda/" target="_blank">Department of Agriculture</a>, a variety of fresh items are also available for sale. Last year watermelon was featured as the fresh item. The featured item this year had not been determined at ILG’s publication deadline.</p>

<p id="E68">The third and final component of the DuPont Food Pavilion is the <a href="http://www.redgold.com/red-gold-brand/home/events/red-gold-activities-at-the-indiana-state-fair" target="_blank">Red Gold Culinary Corner</a> — a full kitchen that features a series of demonstrations and discussions throughout the fair. “[We’re] trying to provide a platform for chefs, artisans, nutritionists, people passionate about food to come in and do demonstrations,” Blackford said. Exhibitions range from cooking presentations to the carving of the big cheese (in which Sarah Kaufmann will carve a sculpture out of a giant block of cheese over six days) to local chefs chatting about the recently published <a href="http://www.indianaharvest.com/" target="_blank">Food For Thought: An Indiana Harvest</a>. A full list of demonstrations can be found on the State Fair website at <a href="http://www.in.gov/statefair/fair/entertainment/food_pavilion.html" target="_blank">in.gov/statefair/fair/entertainment/food_pavilion.html</a>.</p>
<p id="E88"><strong>Big, small, urban and rural</strong></p>
<p id="E96">One of the biggest challenges, and yet, most important parts of bringing the exhibitions together is establishing diversity. The agricultural industry isn’t just about animals or farms — it encompasses restaurants, chefs, artisan products, commodity groups and more. “We’re really showing a diverse range of chefs, a diverse range of food products and we want to promote all things agriculture in Indiana.” Blackford said, “Big, small, you know urban, rural — we want to promote everything agriculture related.” One way the State Fair has tried to advance this goal is to form partnerships with local groups to encourage cross-promotion and different viewpoints.</p>
<p id="E118" data-widowid="E118-widow">Groups the State Fair has formed partnerships with this year include DuPont, Red Gold, <a href="http://www.porterco.org/" target="_blank">Porter County</a> and <a href="http://www.slowfoodindy.com/" target="_blank">Slow Food Indy</a>. Porter County and by extension the <a href="http://www.indianadunes.com/" target="_blank">Indiana Dunes</a> Tourism Office will be featuring products from restaurants in northwest Indiana. Blackford hopes this will not only help add to the diversity of the event but also encourage Hoosiers to travel: “You can come to the fair for 17 days and you can buy these products, see these chefs, but the rest of the year here’s how you go experience these restaurants and interact with these folks.” Blackford said.</p>

<p id="E134">Slow Food Indy, a local chapter of the national grassroots organization that seeks to promote and encourage ethical and nutritious food, will showcase its snail-of-approval seal from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Aug. 11 in the Red Gold Culinary Corner. The <a href="http://www.slowfoodnyc.org/program/snail_approval" target="_blank">snail-of-approval</a> program started in New York in 2007 as a way to recognize restaurants and organizations committed to responsible and clean food. The Indianapolis chapter launched its snail-of-approval program in 2012 to encourage and identify local restaurants committed to the ideals of slow food. Slow Food Indy will feature a lineup of food organizations such as <a href="http://smokinggoose.com/" target="_blank">Smoking Goose</a>, <a href="http://www.rbistro.com/" target="_blank">R Bistro</a>, <a href="http://www.secondhelpings.org/" target="_blank">Second Helpings</a>, <a href="http://lateharvestkitchen.com/" target="_blank">Late Harvest</a>, <a href="http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/fermenti-artisan-healing-through-fermented-foods/Content?oid=2499276" target="_blank">Fermenti Artisan</a>, and <a href="http://www.theindigoduck.com/" target="_blank">Indigo Duck</a>.</p>
<p id="E154"><strong>The parts make the whole</strong></p>
<p id="E162">While promoting and demonstrating diversity is a major goal, it isn’t the only thing the exhibitions feature. Education also is a major component of the presentations. Various groups will inform about nutrition, responsible food production and consumption, and even social problems like hunger. The State Fair has also partnered with the <a href="http://www.indyhunger.org/news" target="_blank">Indy Hunger Network</a> to educate on the serious issue of hunger in the state and beyond. With one in six people going hungry daily according to the Indy Hunger Network, the group is committed to building a system that will allow all Hoosiers access to food by 2015.</p>
<p id="E181">Blackford explained that an important part of the DuPont Food Pavilion experience is to expose fairgoers to all aspects of food and agriculture. As such, the fun aspects intermingle with the serious ones. “We sell gourmet chocolate and then we talk about hunger and then about healthy eating,” Blackford said.</p>
<p id="E189">Juxtaposing education with entertainment, the DuPont Food Pavilion’s various activities — cooking demonstrations, sampling and retail opportunities, kids’ activities, discussions — will all come together to illustrate the significance and importance of agriculture in Indiana. By focusing exclusively on food, as opposed to farming or animals, Blackford hopes to attract a larger swath of fairgoers to educate and entertain about agriculture: “Everybody can relate to food: not everybody likes agriculture.  But they’re one and the same.”</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Dig-IN, A Taste of Indiana Executive Director Rob Gaston is providing a new set of eyes to the fourth year of Indiana&#8217;s farm to fork celebration. Since 7 a.m. on the day of the first event in 2010, Gaston has worked his way from volunteering with set-up to becoming top leadership, but he has other culinary experience that lends to his new position.</span></p>
<div id="pn1">
<p>In 2006, Gaston joined Ivy Tech&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ivytech.edu/southwest/pe/culinaryarts.html" target="_blank">Culinary Arts Program</a>, where he studied under Thom England, a local food activist. England was reviving the <a href="http://www.slowfoodindy.com/" target="_blank">Slow Food Indy</a> chapter and taught Gaston the benefits of local food.</p>
<p>In 2008, Gaston became the Purchasing Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.ivytech.edu/hospitality-admin/" target="_blank">Hospitality Program</a> at Ivy Tech. “I was responsible for everything that came through the door for the program,” said Gaston. Learning how to communicate with Ivy Tech&#8217;s chefs was key.</p>
<p>Gaston Stressed the importance of understanding the chef&#8217;s needs in order to purchase the right foods: “When a chef sources produce for a salad, it needs to be more pristine than if it was plated with a sauce, which doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaston joined the board of directors at Slow Food Indy in January 2012, and by the end of the year he was elected as board chair. A few months later, the executive director position at <a href="http://digindiana.org/" target="_blank">Dig-IN</a> became available, and Gaston knew it was the next step for his career.</p>
<p>“What really sold me on the job is that they were looking for someone who could establish year-round programming – dinners, conversational series of speakers and interactive talks, farm tours and cooking classes – so that DIG Indiana could move from a one-day festival to more education and outreach,” said Gaston. “I had experience in culinary arts training, in being a purchasing coordinator, a business background, and I had some nonprofit experience, so I think that a combination of all of those things is what led me to be the new director.”</p>
<p><strong>Growing smaller</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_14945" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.indianalivinggreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WhonPhoto_C1_DigIN3_094.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-14945 " alt="Submitted Photo" src="http://www.indianalivinggreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WhonPhoto_C1_DigIN3_094-300x195.jpg" width="300" height="195" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Submitted Photo</p></div>
<p id="E52">In the past few years, Dig-IN has had issues with long lines and making sure all ticket holders received food from each vendor. “We&#8217;re actually getting smaller this year,” said Gaston. “At 5,000 people, the capacity of <a href="http://www.inwhiteriver.com/" target="_blank">White River State Park</a>, the number of vendors and food availability becomes tricky. We want to have a better experience for everybody, so we capped the tickets at 4,000 this year. We don&#8217;t want to exclude people — we want everybody who is there to have a great experience.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<div id="pn2">
<div>
<p data-orphanid="E53">Since the event is not a fundraiser, where does money from ticket sales actually go?</p>
<p>“One thing that is unique about Dig IN is that funds are raised to put on the event, not the other way around,” Gaston noted. “Chefs are often asked to donate product for charity events or fundraisers, but in our case, we actually pay for any Indiana sourced ingredients that are used in the dish. This allows us to promote Hoosier farmers and chefs without asking either to donate everything.”</p>
<p>“Zero waste” will be a new theme this year with no trash cans on site. Aided by <a href="http://www.indianarecycling.org/" target="_blank">Indiana Recycling Coalition</a>, compost and recycling bins will be stationed throughout the park, and volunteers will instruct attendees on how to properly dispose of their food and plates.</p>
<p>A VIP tent will feature chefs Neal Brown and Greg Hardesty who will offer cooking demonstrations and samples that can only be found in the tent. <a href="http://www.meshonmass.com/" target="_blank">Mesh on Mass</a>, <a href="http://www.blackmarketindy.net/" target="_blank">Black Market</a> and <a href="http://deliciaindy.com/" target="_blank">Delicia</a> are a few of the new restaurants that will be joining the event.</p>
<p>DIG Indiana is like no other farm to fork event. “They&#8217;re all different, and I think that&#8217;s what the nature of a farm to fork event is. If you&#8217;re showcasing local, that&#8217;s different based on who is involved in putting it together and where you&#8217;re at,” said Gaston. “It&#8217;s year four, and we&#8217;re very much still growing the organization. We&#8217;ve got a lot of diversity on our board, and there are great perspectives and strength in that.”</p>
<p>DIG Indiana takes place at White River State Park on Sunday, Aug. 25, from noon to 5 p.m. Tickets: $40 general admission or $60 for early admission — or $90 for access to the VIP tent. For more, see digindiana.com.</p>

<p>Newly appointed Chair of Indiana’s <a href="http://www.naacp.org/programs/entry/climate-justice" target="_blank">NAACP Environmental Climate Justice</a>, Denise Abdul-Rahman, visited the NUVO/Indiana Living Green offices to discuss her new position, its mission and challenges. Interviewing her were Hannah Leyva, editorial intern, Jim Poyser, Indiana Living Green editor and Rebecca Townsend, NUVO news editor.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana Living Green:</strong> What do you understand your mission to be?</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Denise Abdul-Rahman:</strong></span> Indiana NAACP has 26 branches and my charge is to try to get as many of those branches on board … to get involved in advocating for clean air, clean water and [lower] energy costs.</p>
<p><strong>ILG:</strong> What are the challenges to communities of color when it comes to the environment?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Abdul-Rahman:</span></strong> Communities of color are impacted because coal plants, like the Harding Street coal plant [in downtown Indy], are built within their community and the toxins that they emit — sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide — are typically within the three-mile radius of people of color and of low-income people. Statistics show [an increase in] asthma attacks, heart attacks.</p>
<p><strong>ILG:</strong> What is your plan of action, regarding the Harding Street plant?</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Abdul-Rahman:</strong></span> First, is to go out into the community, organize township meetings and get feedback. Also, identify a person that can engage in Indianapolis on behalf of the Indianapolis NAACP. We don’t have a lot of time, we want to do it by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>ILG:</strong> There is no dispute over the science of what fossil fuel and industrial pollution does to the environment. Why aren’t we moving from something that is clearly destructive to energy sources that are not destructive?</p>
<p><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Abdul-Rahman:</strong></span> I believe that companies are highly invested in their current infrastructures. And communities are not as outraged to move them to make them be more socially responsible. To move them to clean energy requires an investment.</p>
<p><strong>ILG:</strong> So you are not seeing outrage in the immediate communities that are being dumped on?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Abdul-Rahman:</span></strong> In my short period of time I have not seen it. I do need to still go out into the community and gauge why there hasn’t been outrage. Is there no knowledge or are people just concerned with getting up and getting a job and just trying to make it?</p>
<p>I think it is our responsibility — those that are aware — to make them aware that life is going to be affected — the longevity of your life, the quality of your life — is affected.  And so there is a fierce urgency to engage.</p>
<p><strong>ILG:</strong> Why did NAACP pick you for this job?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Abdul-Rahman:</span></strong> I’m a hard working and determined person and I’ve worked for the NAACP for major campaigns. Also, I have a health care management Masters degree and I’m also studying health informatics which incorporates environmental informatics.</p>
<p>My whole background has been in civil rights. My grandmother made the march in 1963 to the “I Have a Dream” speech. She was the first black woman in Lafayette to come to the Indiana convention in the 1970s. My mother has been a civil rights advocate and a grass roots advocate.</p>
<p><strong>ILG:</strong> Do you feel that there are special ways to frame environmental issues?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Abdul-Rahman:</span></strong> I have to then look at myself and say what would motivate me to buy the 7th generation product for seven dollars as opposed to another product for just a dollar. When I went into that thinking it just came down to some messages. One is, if we don’t move into sustainable living then from a health standpoint we’ll be challenged.  Economically, if you don’t make your home more energy efficient, if you don’t reduce your energy costs, then the person next to you is going to be able to have more cash flow. If you own a home you’re not going to be able to start selling it if you don’t start making your home sustainable. So that’s a motivator.</p>
<p>We need to teach our children to take care of our earth, so that they won’t have to live in horrible tornadoes or hurricanes.</p>
<p>I understand that as a person of color it may be challenging economically, but if we don’t [change] we will be left behind.</p>
<p>From the NAACP Coal Blooded report:</p>
<p><b><i>Coal Blooded: Putting Profits Before People </i></b>focuses on the role that coal-fired power plants have in the inequitable health outcomes of low income communities and communities of color in the U.S. and in the contribution of greenhouse gasses that drive climate change, the consequences of which will disproportionately impact people of color and low income communities globally. Additionally, this report provides an empirical discussion of the effects of burning coal in power plants. Researchers focused on the coal plants in the U.S. with the worst records on environmental justice, and on the companies that own them.</p>

<p id="E30">Even though water is beer’s main ingredient, the major use of water is for cleaning and for cooling the initial water and grain mixture so yeast can successfully be added. Johnson explains, “The hot cooling water will be held and distributed through a heat exchanger to heat our new addition and the existing production area.&#8221;</p>
<p id="E34">“We re-cycle glass, metals, plastics; spent grains go to our local farmers for feed supplements; trub and solid wastes are removed for composting both with local companies and Purdue University&#8217;s <a href="http://www3.ag.purdue.edu/programs/studentfarm/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Student Farm</a>,” says Johnson. “We remove our trub to keep organics out of the city sewers.</p>
<p id="E37">PBC sources locally grown ingredients for their tasting room menu and features north German-style beers to utilize Lafayette’s hard water so no energy is wasted changing water to fit styles requiring soft water.</p>
<p id="E43">Since the brewery is located on a leg of the most extensive bike trail system in the Lafayette/West Lafayette city limits, PBC encourages biking to the brewery. “We have a group that does a weekly Sunday ride from a local bike shop to our brewery and then on to <a href="http://www.lafayettebrewingco.com/" target="_blank">Lafayette Brewing Company</a>.” Every Thursday a <a href="http://indianatrailrunning.ning.com/" target="_blank">running club</a> along the Runs Trail stops at PBC for a pint or two as a respite before continuing their circuit.</p>
<p id="E53">Johnson began professional brewing at Lafayette Brewing Company, where founder/brewmaster Greg Emig restored a 121-year old furniture store into a brewpub in 1992, a major move in reclaiming downtown Lafayette.</p>
<p id="E56" data-widowid="E56-widow">“At LBC, we&#8217;ve re-purposed a variety of brewing and foodservice equipment and focused on sourcing locally-produced products for both the brewery and kitchen,” says Emig.  “The bison for our extremely popular bison burgers are raised just up the road in Buffalo, IN.  We use compostable cups for off-premise beer service and recycle all cardboard, plastic, glass, newspaper and spent grease from our fryers.”</p>

Meyers Pedestrian Bridge over the Wabash River. Emig points out all participants receive a re-fillable plastic tasting cup to cut down on waste. The event provides recycling containers for paper and plastic (no glass permitted on the grounds) and a bulk supply of drinking/rinse water.</p>

<p>Available in S, SV and SL trim levels, the five-passenger, front-wheel-drive <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/electric-cars/leaf/" target="_blank">Leaf</a> is powered by an 80 kWh electric motor (107 horsepower and 187 pound-feet of torque) fed by a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The EPA estimates its range with a full charge at 75 miles, which is an increase over previous years due to the regenerative braking and a stylish aerodynamic profile.</p>
<div>
<div id="pn1">
<div>
<p id="E89">A new 6.6-kWh onboard charger cuts charging time in half, but despite an “app” that displays nearby recharging stations on the 7-inch touch-screen monitor, Knapke says some drivers still experience “range anxiety.” Range can be extended by choosing the new “B-mode” that increases regenerative braking under deceleration by nearly 10 percent, although that reduces the amount of torque, which is already noticeably less than in comparable petrol-powered vehicles.</p>
<p id="E117">Electric motors produce 100 percent of their torque at zero RPM for instant acceleration without lag. However, performance testing by Edmunds indicated that the Leaf accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 10.2 seconds – slightly slower than comparable EVs.</p>
<p id="E129">What the well-engineered Leaf excels at providing is near-silent operation, precise handling – thanks in part to placement of the low-mounted battery pack (which also allows for a roomier back seat), crisp braking and ample interior space that comfortably accommodates passengers as tall as the 6’5” Knapke with room to spare. The 60/40 split rear seats provide additional cargo space.</p>
<p id="E154">The SV model features heated steering wheel and seats – front and rear; cruise control, cloth upholstery made from partially recycled material; navigation system, six-speaker surround system, LED headlights and a remote access system.</p>
<p id="E163">The Leaf received five out of five stars for overall protection in government crash testing. Safety features include an optional 360-degree view monitor on the SV and SL models, traction control, front airbags and side curtain airbags and antilock disc brakes. However, Edmunds testing revealed the Leaf took longer than average to stop: 130 feet at 60 mph.</p>
<p id="E166" data-widowid="E166-widow">The Leaf is a fun and saucy four-door urban run-about with minimal reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

<p id="E166-widow" data-orphanid="E166">Future versions may use even less electricity. Knapke says solar panels will be incorporated in the roof of the car to power accessories.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s Labor Day weekend, <a href="http://warmfest.org/" target="_blank">WARMfest</a> music festival is making its first debut in Indy’s Broad Ripple Park and expecting to host 30,000 guests.</p>
<p>Dan Ripley, executive director of WARMfest, loves the water lifestyle and has been a devout promoter of environmental responsibility, independent business and artisans, and sustainable goods and services.</p>
<p>The idea of WARMfest all started out with Ripley&#8217;s passion for Indiana&#8217;s White River and the idea of cultivating stewardship in Indianapolis&#8217;s community.</p>
<p>“The main purpose of the festival is to raise awareness, so that people will begin to learn and appreciate again what we have as a natural resource,” said Ripley. “And the festival hopefully becomes replicable and scalable enough that they can move and go other places, maybe Riverside Park, and raise money and revitalize that part of the river too.”</p>
<p>The Carl G. Fisher Society (CGFS), managers of WARMfest, has a vision to restore and promote the White River to return it to the grandeur of a century ago. Their mission is to educate the community to envision this great river as a recreational and visually appealing natural resource.</p>
<p>“We want to be responsible in every way along the way because as stewards, were trying to cultivate stewardship, were trying to set a system of best practices for the festival and we’ve approach Indy’s parks to work with us,” said Ripley.</p>
<p>There are three elements to WARMfest. One of them is the secondary market place.</p>
<p>“I view the secondary market place as one of the most responsible parts of environmentalism that there is, and it’s sort of neglected for what it is. My theory is that we kind of make all the stuff we need, we don’t need to throw stuff away and make more. We already have a lot of what we need,” said Ripley.</p>
<p>Ripley has been in the art antique business for 15 years and has become inspired to sell things within the secondary market place.</p>
<p>“By selling in the secondary market place, we’re selling things that have already been made and used, and I’m trying to transfer that purpose to this water way here, this purpose to cultivate stewardship. To create stewards of the White River.”</p>

(Submitted photo)</p></div>
<p>The second element of WARMfest is the music festival itself. National and local bands with popular headliners will be playing, like <a title="Michael Franti and Spearhead " href="http://lineup.warmfest.org/band/michael-franti-and-spearhead" target="_blank">Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead</a> who’s well known for the catchy single “<a title="Song" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehu3wy4WkHs" target="_blank">Say Hey (I Love You)</a>.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to the production of the music festival, my production team and my sound and light crews, everybody’s directed to be as environmentally conscious as possible,” said Ripley. “We used LED lighting as much as possible and we try to use clean energy and electricity over generators when possible.”</p>
<p>The third element of WARMFest is to offer non-profit initiatives an aligned purpose. Non profit organizations like <a title="Friends of the White River" href="http://www.friendsofwhiteriver.org/" target="_blank">Friends of the White River</a>, <a href="http://www.broadripplepark.org/" target="_blank">Friends of Broad Ripple Park</a>, and <a title="ROW" href="http://reconnectingtoourwaterways.org/" target="_blank">ROW</a> will be in place to encourage and educate patrons on recycling and reconnecting people to waterways.</p>
<p>“We’re doing things like creating recycling containers with basketball goals that light up if you throw your plastic cup through the goal to start teaching kids,” said Ripley.</p>
<p>Utilizing the vision set forth in <a href="http://www.conservingindiana.org/gi.html" target="_blank">Greening The Crossroads</a>, a publication by the <a href="http://www.conservingindiana.org/" target="_blank">Central Indiana Land Trust</a>, CGFS will spearhead an initiative that will clear non-indigenous growth along the Broad Ripple Park waterfront, allowing park visitors and festival attendees to experience the beautiful view of the river that the park once offered.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot to learn to use these waterways responsibly, and that education process is a big part of that initiative, said Ripley. “With a little effort and awareness, improvements can happen very quickly.”</p>
<p>In addition, WARMfest is peddle-paddle friendly. Docks and lots will be available to accommodate guests who attend the festival with transportation like boats or bikes.</p>
<p>“Our festival is really more than just a music festival,” said Ripley. “There’s a lot of hope in what we’re doing, and a lot of plans for if not this year next year too.”</p>
<p>Indy&#8217;s WARMfest will take off August 31 until September 2 in Broad Ripple Park. Purchase tickets <a href="http://warmfest.org/tickets/">here</a>!</p>
