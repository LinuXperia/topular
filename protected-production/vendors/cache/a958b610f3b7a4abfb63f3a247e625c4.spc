<p>It's been a busy week for Detroit. As the city itself continues to chug along, all <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/business/dan-gilberts-quest-to-remake-downtown-detroit.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">Dan Gilbert-gilded glory</a> or <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-anderson-detroit-bankruptcy-20130724,0,1915404.story">58 minutes-plus of waiting time for the cops to come</a>, the world's been chiming in on <a href="http://www.frumforum.com/who-killed-detroit/">what went so utterly wrong up in Motown.</a></p>

<p>Detroit, once powerhouse of industrial might and paradigm of American ideals and grandeur, has finally fallen from grace: a victim of <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2013/07/how_detroit_almost_killed_my_business.htmlhttp:/www.americanthinker.com/2013/07/how_detroit_almost_killed_my_business.html">poor governance</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2013/07/20/detroit-why-hast-thou-forsaken-me-by-pete-saunders/">racism</a>, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/wheels-detroit-article-1.1404053">lack of economic diversification</a>, <a href="http://ghmltn.blogspot.com/2013/07/pensions-killed-detroit.html">empty pension coffers</a>, and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/a-tale-of-two-rust-belt-cities/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&_r=0">sprawl.</a> And America, beware. While amplified in Detroit, the same underlying dynamics that so rotted the Motor City are <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/detroit-style-default-coming-city-near-you">coming to a city near you.</a></p>

<p>This is to read the obituaries. </p>

<p>And yet, things are getting better all the time in Detroit. Declare bankruptcy one day and announce some green shoots in the economy the next. <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130723/BUSINESS04/307230014/Detroit-riverfront-development-apartments-291-units-Globe-Building">A $60 million mixed-use development is in the works.</a> There's a placemaking renaissance afoot <a href="http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/65464">turning traffic islands into temporary beaches</a> and creating last change. <a href="http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20130724/NEWS/130729926/state-approves-450m-in-bonds-for-red-wings-arena">Here come the Red Wings.</a> Let's not forget, <a href="http://grist.org/news/whole-foods-opens-in-detroit-threatening-stereotypes-everywhere/">Whole Foods just opened up in downtown Detroit.</a></p>

<p>This is to read the news. </p>

<p>To paraphrase a song from one of the city's most successful rappers, will the real Detroit please stand up? <br />
</p>
        <p>As in any city, all of the above factors - both negative and positive - contain elements of truth. No place can ever be complete, and Detroit is no exception, simultaneously all <a href="http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/news/local/se_mich/governor-snyders-says-detroit-bankruptcy-was-tough-right">60,000 vacant parcels</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/special-report/detroit-rising/">home to an expanding creative class.</a> Detroit <em>is</em> bankrupt, but the same could be said for <a href="http://artvoice.com/issues/v12n30/news_analysis">Buffalo</a>, <a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/mayor-garcetti-refutes-claims-city-headed-for-bankruptcy/">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2013/07/bankrupt-is-as-bankrupt-files.html">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-21/business/ct-biz-0721-phil-20130721_1_motor-city-windy-city-chicago">Chicago</a>, or well, <a href="http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/five-major-cities-with-pension-troubles-worse-than-in-detroit">take your pick</a>.</p>

<p>The power of Detroit's insolvency and its move toward bankruptcy resonates for a variety of reasons though. One is simply the massive scale of the city, and how its current situation upends the long-held American notion of growth equaling growth. The other is the <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2013/07/23/what-detroits-bankruptcy-teaches-america/">city's long, precipitous decline</a> coinciding with <a href="http://globalmidwest.typepad.com/global-midwest/2013/02/is-chicago-global-or-miserable-both.html">larger macro socioeconomic trends that affect all of America.</a> The increasing stratification of American society - coupled with renewed emphasis (if not necessarily <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/29/the-triumph-of-suburbia-despite-downtown-hype-americans-choose-sprawl.html">as played out by census numbers</a>, at least in cultural focus) on urbanity makes Detroit <em>real</em>. </p>

<p>For the same reason that "ruin porn" became a cultural touchstone during the height of the recession - after all, in good times, the slow slide of Detroit was largely left out of view - Detroit's municipal public panic is now, well, a <em>public</em> panic, if only because the present saga of Detroit allows society-at-large to use the city as a sounding board.  </p>

<p>In a <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-21/business/ct-biz-0721-phil-20130721_1_motor-city-windy-city-chicago">rather misleading article</a> that seems to encapsulate much of the fear and confusion over what Detroit means for other cities, the Chicago Tribune's Phil Rosenthal writes, "we can spend all day highlighting the differences between the two cities, but we're also spending more than we should. To blithely ignore the warning signs of what happened in the Motor City is as dangerous as thinking you can blow past the flashing lights at a railroad crossing." Rosenthal is correct in highlighting Chicago's pension deficiencies, but he fails to mention that for many in Chicago, <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130302/ISSUE01/303029987/the-hottest-urban-center-in-the-u-s-chicagos-mega-loop">now is a booming age almost like none other</a>. In <a href="http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/burgh-disapora/middle-class-boom-61131/">a renewed age of urban bifurcation</a>, a city like Chicago has <em> just </em>large enough of a global class to keep it afloat, whereas Detroit simply doesn't have as large of such a class within its physical borders to offset the costs of extending services to neighborhoods disconnected from the physical and economic core. </p>

<p>A few years ago, while visiting Pittsburgh, <a href="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2010/08/24/pittsburgh-and-the-magic-of-failure/">I posited on this site that much of the perceived renewal and vitality felt within that city was due to a well-thought out and concerted effort to fail on institutional failures and invest in the intact attributes of a given place</a>. Or as Jim Russell of Burgh Diaspora and Pacific Standard Magazine (<a href="http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/burgh-disapora/detroit-postmortem-63036/">who offers some of the more nuanced and insightful analysis on Detroit's recent situation</a>) succinctly wrapped up my own views, to "Do the Fail." Pittsburgh could be a model for the nation by harnessing failure as "a paradoxical assertion of American greatness."</p>

<p>But Detroit never did the fail. While some may view bankruptcy as the ultimate failure, it is not a strategy <em>of</em> failure, as much as it's a condition of being unable to perform the same policy tricks to somehow come up with new ideas and strategies that build - i.e., subsidize - one's way out of obligations. </p>

<p>Obligations and legacy costs such as Detroit's $3B in unfunded pensions are killers when no one wants to honor and appreciate their own legacy. Detroit would rather not. So it declares bankruptcy as the future beckons brightly.</p>

Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/memoriesbymike/">memories_by_mike </a></em></span></p>

<p>The main takeaway from the Detroit experience, already underway at virtually every level of government, is using the threat of financial implosion as a means of softening the overriding structure and protections of the state, wherein the private person becomes an individualized economic unit. Meanwhile the governing body - on whatever level it may be - looks for cash in private sector pockets for public works. And in our collective vulnerability as <a href="http://hopefulandfree.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/mind-self-society-and-the-generalized-other/">generalized others</a>, unsure of how this all works and being "together, alone," Detroit's problem becomes our problem.</p>

<p>This isn't even a story about Detroit. </p>

<p>Given the underlying racial dynamics that have indeed played a dramatic part in the story of Detroit and the story of America, it's hard not to hear Ellison's invisible man, who could just as easily be asking now, for/as Detroit, to a fearful nation, "Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?"<br />

<p>Former Texas Agriculture Commissioner, nationally syndicated columnist and radio commentator, New York Times bestselling author, and self described American populist <a href="http://www.jimhightower.com/">Jim Hightower</a> knows a thing or two about fighting corporate influence in government, and he is a leading voice in the movement to overturn <em>Citizens United</em>.<br />
</p>
        <p>In town addressing a coalition of campaign finance reform activists this past weekend, Mr. Hightower unpacked the significance of <a href="http://openstates.org/il/bills/98th/SJR27/documents/ILD00129251/">SJR27</a>, a motion recently passed by the Illinois General Assembly calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn <em>Citizens United</em>. Illinois is the 14th state to pass such a motion.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.commonblog.com/2013/05/31/bipartisan-vote-by-general-assembly-calls-on-congress-to-overturn-citizens-united/">bipartisan action</a> represents an organizing victory for watchdog group <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=7497673">Common Cause Illinois</a> and coalition members, who spearheaded the grassroots movement that drafted SJR27 and got it on state ballots in 2012. The measure was widely favored across party lines, with nearly 3/4's of Illinois voters supporting the call.</p>

<p>Jim Hightower isn't surprised that a majority of people are on board to overturn <em>Citizens United</em>. In the wake of the landmark Supreme Court ruling, even with a Democratic president at the helm, governmental favor is smiling down on corporate interests at the expense of the working class like never before. On issue after issue, elected officials are unable or unwilling to pass progressive reforms favored by a majority of Americans.</p>

<p>Did we get <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/04/24-0">universal health care</a>? Nope. Did we implement real <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2012/breaking-house-war-on-environment/">environmental protections</a>? Nada. Did we pass tighter <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/16/despite-trayvon-courts-issuing-pro-gun-control-decisions.html">gun regulations</a>? No siree. Did we enact <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/why-global-financial-crisis-has-been-wasted">financial reforms</a> to prevent catastrophes like the 2007-08 financial meltdown brought on by big banks? You guessed it. No, we did not. Or rather, our elected officials did not act on these issues because doing so would be unacceptable to the corporations who bankroll their very political existence.</p>

<p>Even so-called liberal legislators who voiced initial opposition to the <em>Citizens United</em> ruling, including <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/26/president-obama-citizens-united-imagine-power-will-give-special-interests-over-polit">President Obama</a>, have proven unable to resist the temptations of unlimited <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance">super PAC</a> campaign financing. These Democrats, Mr. Hightower charges, have failed to be Democrats. "When you take that corporate check," he explains, "written on back is that corporate agenda."</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Hightower laments that corporate agendas now broadly navigate political decision making across the country. Here in Illinois, we've seen those corporate interests pushing for movement on issues such as hydraulic fracturing and public service privatization. They've also perpetuated the "myth of austerity" onto state and local budgets, resulting in <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/07/illi-j09.html">steep cuts</a> to education and social services. </p>

<p>Though a majority of Illinois legislators are <a href="http://www.ildems.com/">Democrats</a>, their embrace of corporate economic initiatives seems right out of a Republican playbook. Save for a handful of issues, Illinois legislators have largely eschewed proletarian interests in favor of austere policies benefiting wealthy "job creators".</p>

<p>Some blame Illinois' strong party leadership and top-heavy political system for mucking up progress, but Mr. Hightower insists legislative influences from corporate campaign financing and corporate interest groups like the <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?b=7743229&c=dkLNK1MQIwG">American Legislative Executive Council</a> (ALEC) merit a hearty chunk of that blame. </p>

<p>He points to Chicago Mayor <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/is-rahm-emanuel-a-dino-democrat-name-only">Rahm Emanuel</a> as a poster boy corporate Democrat. The mayor's successful political career has been predicated on large corporate campaign contributions, and he answers chiefly to those corporate financiers, not to the people of Chicago, Mr. Hightower asserts. </p>

<p>For those who've been paying attention to Rahm Emanuel's political trajectory, like Jim Hightower has been, the Mayor's push to <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-24/news/ct-met-charter-schools-chicago-strike-20120924_1_charter-schools-charter-networks-resources-from-neighborhood-schools">privatize</a> public education doesn't come as a surprise. He's a former banker who left Wall Street to became a politician. That's what bankers-turned-politicians do, Mr. Hightower says, they support business friendly, laissez-faire policies. </p>

<p>Despite the corporate vice grip on government at the moment, Jim Hightower still believes in the power of the people to restore our democracy. He sees proof of that power in the growing movement of Americans organizing to overturn <em>Citizens United</em>. </p>

<p>Regardless of the amendment's final outcome, Mr. Hightower notes that passing the motion to overturn <em>Citizens United</em> through the Illinois General Assembly has been an effective organizing tool in and of itself. The movement has coordinated, strengthened, and galvanized an active group of citizens who are creating the infrastructure for progressive politics and working to keep government accountable. "That's democracy," he beams.</p>

<p>Mr. Hightower admits that passing this constitutional amendment isn't going to fix the entire problem of money in politics. It is, however, a necessary and powerful first step. While overturning <em>Citizens United</em> would not prohibit corporate political spending, it would place caps on that spending and stifle the campaign finance <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30026037?uid=3739656&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21102495480751">arms race</a>. Beyond that, Mr. Hightower acknowledges that truly severing the financial and political bonds between corporations and government will require further action. </p>

<p>When asked what other campaign financing reforms, if any, would go far enough to eliminate corporate control over government, Mr. Hightower answers unwaveringly, "Publicly financed elections." </p>

<p>Picture an electoral process in which all legitimate candidates receive equal, modest campaign funding, and are strictly limited to that funding. Runs for political office would no longer be determined by a candidate's access to private funding and advertising, but rather, by genuine public support garnered by action. Third party candidates would finally have a fighting chance at political representation as well. Plus, mandatory <a href="http://www.publicampaign.org/fair-facts">public campaign financing</a> would enable legislators to actually focus on doing their jobs instead of constant fundraising for campaign contributions. </p>

<p>Comprehensive campaign reform won't come easily, but Mr. Hightower knows it can be done. He predicts the organizational strength forming around the movement to overturn <em>Citizens United</em> will, in time, stoke fires under more campaign finance reform movements. Educating voters and establishing a younger, more active political base will propel the effort. Mr. Hightower underscores the necessity of continued public strategizing, organizing, and mobilizing to push Congress towards progressive reform. </p>

<p>After all, ours is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and it is up to the people to guard that democracy and keep it so. </p>

<p>Legislation currently on Governor Quinn's desk could dramatically alter the way Illinois manages its own water resources. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1379&GAID=12&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=85&GA=98">House Bill 1379</a> would allow <a href="http://www.amwater.com/ilaw/">Illinois American Water</a> and <a href="https://www.aquaamerica.com/our-states/illinois.aspx">Aqua Illinois</a>, two of the state's largest private water companies, to expedite acquisitions of municipal water systems and increase customer rates to fund their expansion. </p>
        <p>Lawmakers claim easing restrictions on water and sewage system outsourcing is a pragmatic way for cash strapped municipalities across the state to <a href="http://www.progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2012/03/02/quinns-budgetary-push-clean-drinking-water-illinois">save money</a> on utility management. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizensutilityboard.org/newsReleases20130429_WaterLegislation.html">Critics</a> of the proposed legislation insist water and sewage privatization is a dangerous gamble with an essential public resource that will cost Illinois residents. </p>

<p>Non-profit water advocacy group <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/water/private-vs-public/">Food and Water Watch</a> explains that multinational water corporations are beholden to stockholders, not the public they serve, which inevitably limits transparency and public accountability. This can result in problems like unequal water and sewage services, because privately owned water utilities are prone to <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/water/private-vs-public/facts-and-figures/">"cherry-pick"</a> profitable, high-volume service areas and neglect low-income areas where lower volume and bill collection problems hinder profitability. </p>

<p>Opponents also criticize private water corporations for instituting steep consumer rate-hikes. <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/factsheet/questions-answers-a-cost-comparison-of-public-and-private-water-utility-operation/">Food & Water Watch</a> reports that private water utilities charge 33 percent more for water and 63 percent more for sewer service, on average, than local government utilities. </p>

<p>While HB 1379 supporters hold steadfast to cost-effective arguments for this impetus to overhaul water privatization in Illinois, the state's record of privatization, thus far, seriously calls into question the wisdom of that position. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://watchdog.org/75399/taxpayers-lose-on-lotto-deal-il-lawmaker-says-even-with-20-million-fine/">Illinois State Lottery</a> and <a href="http://theexpiredmeter.com/2011/08/illinois-tollway-authority-whacks-drivers-with-painful-toll-price-increase/">state tollways</a>, to the <a href="http://www.wbez.org/blog/justin-kaufmann/2011-04-25/privatization-woes-wouldnt-it-be-nice-freeze-skyway-toll-increases-o">Chicago Skyway</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/us/20cncmeters.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">parking meters</a>, privatization contracts have not proven to be good deals for the people or the governments of Illinois.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/freshwater-crisis/">global freshwater</a> becomes increasingly scarce, the ramifications of selling off public water resources could go far beyond what Illinois legislators have really considered. Now, more than ever, the importance of ensuring quality, public interest based management of this diminishing resource cannot be overstated. </p>

<p>HB 1379 could become law any day now. Opponents encourage concerned Illinois residents to tell Gov.

        <p><em>By</em> Byl Adam</p>

<p>As we've learned over the past week and as we're reminded every day, injustice is not only alive and well but thriving here in the United States. Just as with people from other minority groups, people with disabilities face discrimination every day, even in a "progressive" city like Chicago. Discrimination in terms of housing, employment and medical care. Discrimination in terms of marriage equality and the right to bear and raise children. Discrimination in terms of the right to control or even have a say in matters regarding their own bodies. </p>

<p>In 2013, people with disabilities are openly mocked and made fun of in front of their friends, their partners, their families, in front of strangers. In 2013, many still find it acceptable to use the word "retarded" to describe something &mdash; or someone &mdash; they view as stupid. As ugly. As inferior. As not equal. Terms like "midget," "crip" and "vegetable" are still thrown about, with the users often not even beginning to fathom that what they're saying is offensive. That it's hurtful. That it's cruel.</p>

<p>The first time someone invited me to the <a href="http://www.disabilityprideparade.com/">Disability Pride Parade</a>, my first reaction was "Well, I don't have a disability, so why would I go?" Though I do feel a sense of embarrassment over this now, I think it's common to feel that issues related to disability don't really apply to the non-disabled community. I've always felt an opposition to any sort of discrimination, but I felt that as someone who defines as "abled," this was not really my battle to fight.</p>
        <p>As time has gone on however, I've seen first hand the ways in which discrimination against people with disabilities is a problem for everyone, including those of abled status. I've learned that it doesn't necessarily feel good for people with disabilities to be labeled as "inspiring." I notice now when spaces aren't wheelchair accessible, and I've become conscious of the ways in which my home, my church, and my workplace would be problematic to a person with a mobility disability. I've become conscious of how simply having a disabled character on a TV program isn't enough, and that such portrayals can inadvertently have elements that are insensitive and even offensive. </p>

<p>After being involved with the parade and growing into someone who identifies as a disability ally, I've learned a lot. I'm learning all the time. I do feel nervous at times that I'll do or say the wrong thing. What if a person who is deaf or otherwise has difficulty with verbal communication is speaking to me and I can't understand what they're saying? How can I truly understand the experiences of persons with disabilities when I haven't experienced it firsthand? </p>

<p>Quite simply, I can't. All I can do is be open and receptive, keep my mind free, and be honest with others and myself. I'm learning. I hope I won't ever say or do "the wrong thing," but if I do, I can only hope that others will see how important it is to me that I then learn to do the right thing, and will help shed a light on things in a way I'm not able to do myself. </p>

<p>As a gay person, I'm moved by the efforts of those who do not identify as gay but have aligned themselves with the LGBT community and the struggle for civil rights. Why would this not apply to the relationship between people who don't consider themselves disabled and the disability community? As Martin Luther King Jr. stated in a letter written from inside a cell in the Birmingham Jail, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." Injustice toward the disability community is everyone's problem.</p>

<p>The Disability Pride Parade is one day out of the year &mdash; one space in which people with disabilities are not the exception, but the rule. It's a celebration of the strength and perseverance that people with disabilities must show each and every day of their lives. Per the parade planning committee's mission statement, it's a day in which we aim to change the way people think about and define disability; to break down and end the internalized shame among people with disabilities; and to promote the belief that disability is a natural and beautiful part of human diversity in which people with disabilities can take pride. </p>

<p>This year's Disability Pride Parade takes place in less than a week &mdash; this Saturday, July 20. The planning process takes all year, and it's been a particularly uphill battle this year. We don't have enough money. The Disability Pride Parade relies entirely on sponsorships, many from small disability-related organizations who are financially squeezed themselves. No one gets paid for their efforts in planning the parade. At times this past year it's felt like I have another job, as I've struggled to keep our social media pages updated, figure out the entertainment lineup, field email after email, and attend monthly, sometimes weekly meetings. At times I've felt resentful, and at times I've fantasized about what my life would be like if I didn't have this huge project to work on. I'd guess that others on the planning committee have felt this way too. But as the parade draws closer, I'm running on pure adrenaline. </p>

<p>There's still a lot to do, but at this point &mdash; I know that this parade is going to happen, and not only that, it's going to succeed. I know what it means to people. I know that what it means to me is different than what it means to a child with autism, or a paralyzed veteran, or someone who has been blind for their entire life (or just a portion of it). The Disability Pride Parade impacts everyone who participates in a unique way, but it does impact all of us. The issue of civil rights for people with disabilities is an issue for each and every one of us, and I say, why shouldn't the celebration be for everyone too? </p>

<p>Though there's still plenty of work to be done, I can't wait for Saturday. The people I've worked with on planning this day have become so important to me, and making this parade happen is even more special to me because it's a victory for all of us. For those of you who will be at this year's parade, I hope it's a wonderful experience. For those of you who can't make it &mdash; there are things you can do. We're always accepting donations, and for an organization like ours, any donation helps. Help us spread the word. Volunteer. Educate yourself on disability issues. Challenge yourself. Trust your intentions. We're all in this together, and the fight is far from over.</p>

        <p>The Evanston City Council last night, July 15, unanimously passed an "assault weapons ban" ("AWB") ordinance to the cheers of many in the council chambers, and -- a rarity -- the approval of even many gun owners. The ordinance passed under a perceived municipal rush to pass something, anything, under the recently-enacted Illinois concealed-carry ordinance which purported to strip home rule municipalities of their power to regulate so-called "assault weapons" (undefined in the state law) after 10 days of the state bill's enactment. For those interested, the pre-emption section, now codified at 430 ILCS 65/13.1, begins on <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/98/PDF/098-0063.pdf">p. 122 of the 168-page bill.</a></p>

<p>The Council in liberal Evanston, on the North Shore where there is no political downside in supporting any gun control measure and no political upside to opposing any, previously considered a version of the ordinance at its July 8 meeting but directed staff to address complaints that the ordinance was over-reaching and, like <a href="http://www.assaultweapon.info/">most such legislation</a>, mainly banned firearms on the grounds of cosmetic or user-preference features (such as thumbhole stocks) rather than lethality. The version of <a href="http://tinyurl.com/EvanstonAWB-pdf">the ordinance ultimately passed</a> dealt with the issue by eliminating all of those cosmetic features as a grounds for banning a rifle, and using magazine size (15 bullets or more) as the definer -- as arbitrary limits go, one that has <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/06/dont_mourn_the_assault_weapons_bans_impending_demise/">broader acceptance</a>. For handguns, the definitions were left largely intact, mainly banning features that allow a handgun to be transformed into a short "long gun." For shotguns, again removable magazines remained as the main differentiater.</p>

<p>Depending how you look at it, the maneuver was darned clever, or pointless, or both. However, the end result may be that Evanston may avoid costly litigation, an outcome devoutly to be wished.</p>
        <p>The first reason the changes might be clever were that they did address the justifiable howls of semi-automatic rifle owners (or future purchasers) that the "banned" features mainly were admittedly "cosmetic" aspects (to quote the state law) that have nothing to do with lethality or crime, only style or basic functionality, a <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/ecm_dlv/groups/public/@nyu_law_website__journals__journal_of_legislation_and_public_policy/documents/documents/ecm_pro_060716.pdf">well-documented argument</a> that, however, does not stop my gun control friends from inaccurately and irrelevantly repeating that semi-automatic firearms are "weapons of war" (it's inaccurate because modern armies do not equip troops with the consumer-grade non-selective-fire guns most AWBs target, <em>and</em> because, demonstrably, the millions of US owners don't use them in warlike manner; it's  irrelevant because "weapons of war" such as sidearms and WWII-type guns have been legal and will be legal for a long time).</p>

<p>The second clever aspect is that the new ordinance reduces the number of firearms affected -- and so the number of potential lawsuit plaintiffs -- to almost zero, at least in Evanston. Evanston has roughly 1,800 FOID card owners. Assuming the number of gunless card owners and the number of cardless gun owners roughly balance out, and that Evanston is on par with national stats, maybe a few hundred Evanston residents own semi-automatic firearms -- probably fewer since most such ownership is of handguns, which Evanston until recently banned. Of, say, 300 such owners, estimate 100 own semi-automatic rifles and of those, maybe a dozen, maybe only single digits,have magazines of 15 bullets or more. Many if not all of those rifles could be made AWB-compliant with modification.</p>

<p>Likely there are zero shotguns in Evanston affected by the ordinance and very few, if any, handguns (assuming handguns can even be assault weapons under the new law, a gray area). So at the end of the day, the ordinance affects probably only a couple dozen Evanston guns. The <em>illegal</em> owners are not going to sue, and if a legal owner or gun advocacy organization came to me, I'd advise them it wasn't worth it. Going to a gunsmith or a gun show to modify or exchange the offending piece, or renting a storage locker out of town, would be cheaper. Plus, the more limited a law, the more likely it is to be upheld. If the NRA, ISRA, or an ordinary citizen wants to challenge a local AWB, best to pick a fight where councilmen have gone further overboard in arbitrarily banning cosmetic features such as pistol grips. To that extent, the ordinance may be brilliant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fact that the Evanston ordinance impacts so few guns (hence my airquotes-within-airquotes title), also shows how unnecessary it was. Instead of holding hearings and taking meaningful evidence on what is, after all, a potential infringement on federal and (more powerful) state constitutional rights, the City limited public comment to ridiculous, hurried statements of 75 seconds. The City's format, under pressure of a state "Buy now! Only 10 Days Left!" tactic, virtually prevented any presentation of real data, let alone challenge of assertions, real debate, or thoughtful consideration.</p>

<p>What the data would show is that there are probably <a href="http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2013/assault-weapons-overview.aspx">50-60 million semi-automatic weapons</a> in circulation in America. A reported 18-20% of firearm owners have semiautos, yet such weapons account for only <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/23290/7-reasons-why-an-assault-weapons-ban-will-fail-to-reduce-violent-crime">2%-3% of gun homicides and other gun crimes</a>. Rifles in particular are generally not used in crime -- more people are murdered by beatings and stranglings, or by knives, than by rifles in America. Although models such as the AR-15 whose looks so scare suburbanites are the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0206/Gun-debate-101-Is-the-AR-15-as-popular-as-the-iPod">hottest-selling in the US</a>, they account for only a tiny fraction of gun crimes, certainly less than 1%. By <em>any</em> measure, not only are the folks who own these <strong><em>rarely</em></strong> the barbarians blazing away in our cities, but by the numbers they appear to be more responsible than the average gun owner.</p>

<p>Some of the gun control advocates know this. Some don't -- those fixated on the horrible but outlier incidents like Aurora or Newtown, where a deranged citizen has wielded one of the scary-looking pieces in a spree shooting, subordinate statistics or context to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Decision-making.2C_belief.2C_and_behavioral_biases">cognitive biases</a>, whereby rare psycho killings warrant confiscating millions of firearms from millions of law-abiding hunters, target shooters and homeowners who own and maintain them with absolutely no thought <em>or threat </em>of public mayhem. But the smarter, calmer gun control advocates <em>know</em> that what they most vocally seek to ban are the guns least likely to be used in violent crime -- and they don't care. Or rather, they exploit the tough looks and repeat-shooting capacity of modern semi-automatics as prelude to broader bans. The overarching object of an ordinance like Evanston's, other than to sate the "we have do something!" impulse, is to assert the right of the State to ban firearms, period. The oft-heard assurance, "Oh, nobody wants to take your guns away" is hooey. Both privately and overtly, many gun controllers will say that an AWB is just a "first step," and the state law vaguely says that a local ordinance allows for later amendment.</p>

<p>But for now, the issue is hopefully put to bed in Evanston. I'd have preferred that bandwidth and staff resources had been devoted to measures with more likelihood of real payback and a litigation risk of zero. But it's like Evanston's recent "vacation rental" ordinance: as unnecessary laws go, it's not the worst I've seen. It will change little: a few owners of affected firearms may grumble and modify, sell, or relocate theirs; a few others will decide just to keep it under the table (or bed). What <em>won't </em>happen is that gangs stop gangbanging, or alter their purchase decisions, or that some nascent Lanza or Holmes says "Gee, because of this ordinance I may need to reconsider my planned massacre." But at least we are less likely to see Evanston officials being embarrassingly grilled about why they banned features whose relationship to crime they can't possibly explain, while lawyers run up hundreds of thousands in legal fees at taxpayer expense. Meanwhile, other smart communities, if they don't decline altogether to wade into gun control (as <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-09/news/ct-tl-park-ridge-cow-0711-20130709_1_assault-weapons-concealed-weapons-gun-laws">Park Ridge</a> and <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/07/16/waukegan-rejects-assault-weapons-ban/">Waukegan</a> have declined), may consider a largely-symbolic gesture such as Evanston's as a way to make a statement while moving on to strategies with more tangible results.</p>

        <p>Cook County Clerk David Orr, in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmPUFdWTfqE&feature=player_embedded#at=38">half-hour July 12 press conference</a> releasing his office's required <a href="http://www.cookctyclerk.com/newsroom/newsfromclerk%5CPages/2012TIFreport.aspx">2012 tax increment financing ("TIF") revenue report</a>, highlighted the enormous amount of revenue siphoned from Chicago and Cook County taxpayers into TIF districts, and called for early declaration of surpluses within Chicago to fund needs like schools. Observing that billions of dollars have flowed into the now-over-500 districts, Orr released a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ws52ykXb-MM">video (embedded below) on the Clerk's website</a> to help taxpayers grasp how the little-understood mechanisms work.</p>

<p>The video's tone suggests a school science filmstrip, kind of quiet in view of the alarming numbers, but this is government, not advocacy. At 2:41, over soothing guitar arpeggios, a pleasant female narrator says, "In most cases, taxpayers outside the TIFs pay more to generate the revenue requested by [their own] taxing districts." TIF critics such as <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-chicago-reader-tif-archive/Content?oid=1180567">the Reader's Ben Joravsky</a> have hammered relentlessly on this, how TIFs hike your taxes, but it's easy to miss in the video unless you pause.</p>

<p>Orr's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmPUFdWTfqE&feature=player_embedded#at=38">press conference</a> was both longer and stronger than the official video. Noting that Chicago's collective TIF districts pull in half as many tax dollars as the City itself, Orr expressed concern that so "many taxpayer dollars are diverted into the Loop,"  charged that "not enough is being done in the neighborhoods," and that there has been little transparency as to how $5.5 billion in TIF dollars has been spent. He urged Mayor Emanuel and the City Council to declare a TIF surplus this year "as soon as possible" for the benefit of Chicago Public Schools, asking, "How do you explain to the kids in many of these schools that gym, music and art classes are cancelled while profitable businesses downtown ... received 25, 30, 40, 50 million?" Good question.</p>

<p>While Orr's remarks centered on Chicago, they echoed <a href="http://www.evanstonroundtable.com/main.asp?SectionID=6&SubSectionID=6&ArticleID=6041">the same requests made by pressed suburban taxpayers</a> for more transparency and accountability, better metrics, declarations of surpluses, and early retirement of no-longer-needed districts.</p>

<p>Overall, the video capably illustrates TIF workings and numbers, whose magnitude needs time to sink in, and Orr deserves credit for shining further light on what is now a gargantuan but opaque component of local governmental taxing and spending.</p>

        <p><em>By</em> Julie Hallums</p>

<p>It's a challenging time to be a Chicago educator. In the days ahead, those of us in Chicago Public Schools and classrooms will grapple with the implications of school closings, layoffs and the reality of a system that continues to fail too many students across our city. As I reflect on my last ten years as a Chicago Public Schools teacher and all the up-hill ahead, the need to come together to deliver on the promise of equal educational opportunity for the children of Chicago has never been more pressing. </p>
        <p>As a National Board Certified Teacher now on the path to school leadership, I believe deeply in the need to develop and support a well-trained force of educators. I first stepped into the classroom in 2003, as a Teach For America corps member. Since then, I've spent a decade working arm in arm with educators of all backgrounds. And while those from the outside are quick to draw lines between teachers who entered the profession like I did and those who took a more traditional path, my experience couldn't have been more different. Over the last ten years, I've been as much learner as teacher. And whether through an exciting approach to technology introduced by a first-year corps member or a stellar lesson on Shakespeare shared by a 20-year-veteran, my colleagues have taught me well. </p>

<p>When we think seriously about how to help students thrive, the need to foster these productive relationships that keep educators inspired and supported comes into focus. This fall, on my tenth first day of school in those very same hallways where I first began, few of my colleagues were those who were there when I started. Across the board, too many of our most promising, talented teachers leave too soon. This isn't a problem specific to one path or another, it's a public schools problem. And it's most extreme in our highest-need schools - where days are long, budgets are tight, and the work is hard. </p>

<p>I see TFA as one of many organizations working to address this. In recent weeks, <a href="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2013/06/24/is-teach-for-america-a-good-thing-for-chicago-public-schools/">critics have taken issue with the increase in corps members</a> in CPS but have ignored the key driver behind that growth. Here in Chicago, principals make all decisions as to who to hire to lead their students. That means that corps members interview alongside candidates of all backgrounds as positions become available. Not a single one would come to our city if individual principals didn't decide to bring them on. </p>

<p>In making these decisions, principals draw on personal experience working with corps members (both in their role as school leaders and during their time as teachers) and on a strong body of research on their classroom impact. And while some continue to argue that TFA has a place only in the face of a severe teaching shortage - situations in which classrooms otherwise sit empty -  I believe that students benefit when principals have access to the most robust possible talent pipeline. </p>

<p>Every corps member and alumni of TFA has a different experience - just as every student needs something slightly different from us. The supports I received helped me find my voice as an educator and think broadly about how to engage my students. For me, this has meant meeting with students and parents in their homes. It has meant Saturday trips to the library for homework help. It has meant trying my hand at grant-writing to get my kids access to the technology and high-quality literature on which they thrive. Now, it means spending the next year as a principal-in-residence - supporting teachers, learning from visionary principals and assistant principals, and working to become the strongest leader I can be. </p>

<p>I am grateful for the training and support that sustains me in this work. And as we continue to zero in on what will it take to ensure that every Chicago student and teacher has the chance excel, I hope we'll remember to celebrate each and every path that brings a great teacher to the classroom and examine closely what draws too many of them away.  To do so, we must decide.  Will we get wrapped up in one controversy after the next? Or will we ask the difficult, complex questions and have the hard but rich conversations about what it will take to build the system our students deserve? </p>

Yes for Independent Maps seeks to reform the legislative redistricting process in Illinois through a ballot initiative. </p>

<p>Yes for Independent Maps will begin today with the collection of more than 298,000 signatures on a petition to have the initiative appear on the ballot for the 2014 general election. They will collect signatures up until May 4, 2014.</p>

<p>"We are excited to launch this campaign to fix Illinois' broken, behind-closed-doors redistricting process and put the voters back in charge," said Ryan Blitstein, Yes for Independent Maps' senior advisor in a press release.  "Our coalition members have been working for more than two years to reach this point.  With their help, and with support from a diverse group of volunteers and activists across the state, we will gather the necessary signatures to place this measure on the November 2014 ballot."  </p>

        <p>After longstanding disagreements and intense negotiations, the <a href="http://www.hyatt.com/hyatt/index.jsp?src=agn_smg_hhc_ppc_google_ss_tm_hyattinfo_hyatthotelcorp_hyatthotelcorp&fund=fs&keywordtype=brand&mckv=srLb4OXHL_dc|pcrid|31702012159|mtid|3944uit18967">Hyatt Hotels Corporation</a> and <a href="http://www.unitehere.org/">UNITE HERE </a>, a hospitality union comprised of Canadian and American workers have finally reached a <a href="http://www.hyatthurts.org/2013/07/unite-here-and-hyatt-reach-national-agreement/">plausible contract</a>.</p>

<p>The Hyatt Hotel Corporation has been under fire for its <a href="http://www.hyatthurts.org/about-the-boycott/">unethical employment practices,</a> firing housekeeping staff and replacing them with low-wage workers, relying on temp agencies, and dropping workers who take their lawsuits to court. Additionally, the housekeeping and maintenance staff experienced labor abuses with heavy shift loads and an array of hazardous duties that ranked Hyatt workers with the highest percentage of injuries among hotel companies.  The resolution hopes to bring an end to wage abuse, mistreatment of workers and accountability for the Hyatt Corporation. According to a UNITE HERE spokesperson, "In the long struggle folks have been without a contract for four years. Now we are just focused on moving forward." </p>

<p>The recent agreement will lay the foundation for a productive partnership that includes wage increases and a more generous benefits package that will be in effect until 2018. Employees are hoping for "substantial back pay, quality healthcare and pension benefits," says the UNITE HERE spokesperson.  The contact includes Hyatt locations in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Honolulu. </p>
        <p>The highly-anticipated solution also ceased the<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/hyatt-hotels-boycott_n_1694828.html"> global boycott </a>of Hyatt hotel which caused a stir around the world. Last June, other unions such as the Broad Coalition and the National Football League Players Association also boycotted Hyatt.  Tensions escalated when protesters from The National Organization for Women, The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, The Black Justice Center, and Christian and Jewish groups held a series of demonstrations across the nation in 2012. The hospitality industry is hoping 2013 turns over a new leaf for their financial stability and employment circumstances. <br />
The UNITE HERE/Hyatt struggle mirrors the famous <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-30/business/chi-congress-plaza-hotel-strike-20130530_1_peter-andjelkovich-congress-plaza-hotel-hotel-and-union-officials">Congress Plaza Hotel strike</a> in Chicago that ended May 30 after 10 years. <br />
In June 2003, over 130 housekeeping employees went on strike after the hotel's proposal for health care cuts, wage freezes and subcontracting positions. UNITE HERE Local 1 felt they've spread their message, invoked change and effectively decreased hotel business. </p>

<p>"It's [the fight] an example that shows that workers can move forward even in tough economic times, and be a positive example in the industry," states the UNITE HERE spokesperson. Although there are victories for hospitality workers, there are still numerous labor unions that are fighting for the same rights. </p>

        <p>At a press conference Tuesday, <a href="http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&RecNum=11323">Governor Pat Quinn</a> announced what he called "common sense changes" to the General Assembly's concealed-carry bill. The governor <a href="http://capitolfax.com/2013/07/02/quinn-issues-amendatory-veto/">vetoed</a> several specific measures in the proposed legislation, citing "serious safety problems" and too many provisions "inspired by the National Rifle Association, not the common good."</p>

<p>Quinn's revisions include a move to ban concealed weapons inside places that serve alcohol, and to limit permitted gun owners only one concealed weapon, holding a maximum of 10 rounds of ammunition, to be carried at a time. The governor also nixed a provision to prevent home-rule towns from passing assault weapon bans, tightened a partial-conceal provision to complete-conceal, and moved to give employers more regulatory discretion over guns in their businesses. </p>
        <p>The fate of Illinois concealed-carry is now back in the legislature, where assembly members will vote to reject or approve Quinn's revisions. Overriding the governor requires a three-fifths majority vote in both chambers.</p>

<p>While Quinn's Democratic party holds significant majorities in the General Assembly, this does not guarantee his revisions will be passed. The gun control debate is largely divided along urban-rural lines, and plenty of downstate Democratic assembly members are prepared to fight alongside traditional Republican voices like the <a href="http://www.isra.org/legislation/">Illinois State Rifle Association</a> to override Quinn's changes. Leading Democrats including House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton have also moved to reject the governor's amendatory vetoes. </p>

<p>Sponsoring <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/clout/chi-quinn-writes-stricter-rules-into-concealed-carry-bill-20130702,0,7934500.story">Representative Brandon Phelps</a>, D-Harrisburg, describes Quinn's changes as a "total rewrite," and accuses the governor of "political pandering to Chicago." He argues that if the governor was serious about the revisions, he would have had a legislative member running a trailer bill to make changes, rather than springing them on the General Assembly a mere week before the deadline. </p>

<p>The deadline Representative Phelps refers to is the July 9th date imposed on Illinois last December by a federal appeals court, which found the state's law banning residents from carrying concealed guns in public <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/11/illinois-concealed-carry-_n_2278114.html">unconstitutional</a>. The court mandated Illinois, the only state in the country with a concealed weapon ban, to pass new concealed-carry gun legislation within six months.</p>

<p>With the federal deadline looming less than a week away, there is rising concern that legislative agreement on the governor's rewrites may not be reached in time. If that were to happen, Illinois would be left with a wide-open concealed-carry law that even sponsors of the concealed-carry bill are hoping to avoid. <br />

        <p>Hundreds of drunks in <a href="http://chicagoist.com/2013/06/25/photos_brovolution_sweeps_chicago_a.php#photo-1">Wrigleyville crowded the streets more than usual on Monday</a> night to celebrate the Blackhawks winning the Stanley Cup. Fireworks were shot off in Wrigleyville and then the Chicago police pushed the crowds south, where windows <a href="http://crimeinboystown.blogspot.com/2013/06/photos-blackhawks-aftermath-in-lincoln.html">were smashed in Lake View</a> and <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130625/lincoln-park/blackhawks-fans-celebrating-cup-win-shatter-dozens-of-windows">Lincoln Park</a>.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile WGN was describing the scene in Wrigleyville as a "celebration," albeit a bit rowdy. It was a stark contrast compared to their coverage of the NATO protests in 2012, which sounded like all hell breaking loose near McCormack Place. Ultimately, the NATO protests were rather peaceful.</p>

<p>There is a double standard with how we view and treat sports-related riots and political protests. If sports fans are being destructive as part of their celebration, In October 2010, <a href="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2011/10/23/more-than-100-arrested-as-occupy-chicago-takes-the-horse/">more than 100 people were arrested in Grant Park</a> when Occupy Chicago tried to occupy Grant Park. By all accounts, the actions of the people who tried to occupy Grant Park on a Saturday night were very peaceful. On Monday night, <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/iteam&id=9152072">23 people were arrested</a> during the "celebration."</p>

<p>Edward McClelland summed up the <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/What-If-NATO-Protestors-Had-Behaved-Like-Blackhawks-Fans-212952441.html">difference between NATO protesters and Blackhawks fans on the North Side</a> very well: </p>

<blockquote>The difference, of course, between a riot against a meeting of defense ministers and the hijinks of rowdy hockey fans is that the first would have been an embarrassment to Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had already lost the G-8 Summit after doubts about Chicago's ability to provide police protection. The second celebrated an event whose glory will reflect on Rahm. This is his first sports championship as mayor of Chicago. You can bet he'll be on stage at Friday's celebration and will pose with the Stanley Cup. </blockquote>

<p>McClelland sums up why sports riots are almost accepted as part of sports culture. When a team wins and there's a riot it's related to something that is ultimately a point of pride to a city. When a group of people protest anything politics related, it reflects poorly on a government because they're being called out on their poor choices. It's actually a bit surprising no one has commented on the internet about how the Blackhawks winning the Stanley Cup might be distracting Chicagoans from the huge controversy involving the Chicago Public Schools and the proposed arena for DePaul University.</p>

<p>When things get a bit out of hand at a celebration over a sports victory, a few people will <a href="http://deadspin.com/photos-chicagos-stanley-cup-celebrations-got-slightly-571941004">comment about the situation</a> but a large group of people don't seem to say such behavior is uncouth. </p>

<p>If there's destructive behavior as the result of a sports team losing, it seems to be treated with more disdain. When riots <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2011/06/15/bc-stanley-cup-fans-post-game-7.html">occurred in Vancouver</a> after the Vancouver Canucks lost the Stanley Cup finals in 2011 people were disgusted by what happened. But only then does destructive behavior in sports really start to be treated as a bad thing.</p>

<p>When people march in the streets to protest something they view as being wrong they will likely be met with jeers, shouts of "Get a job" and possibly arrest. If cities and the media continue to freak out over protests they need to be equally concerned with behavior like this related to sports.</p>

<p>There is a huge difference between hugging your friends when your team wins, lifting a fake Stanley Cup over your head or dancing in the streets to "Chelsea Dagger" and rioting. But when a celebration causes more damage and disruption than a protest and very little happens to the revelers, the approach of a city has to be reevaluated. </p>

        <p>Chicago schools have seen reductions at almost every level over the past couple years. Cuts to teacher salaries, jobs, and benefits, student arts and athletics programs, and even entire school budgets have created a new austerity within CPS. Amidst all the downsizing, however, one educational element has been growing in stark contrast. Teach For America recruits are teeming into Chicago schools like never before. </p>

<p>Teach For America, a branch of AmeriCorps, is the largest school reform not-for-profit organization in our country. On a mission to improve education and break the cycle of poverty, TFA recruits elite college graduates, gives them about a month of intensive training, and places them in two year termed teaching positions at low-income schools across the country. <br />
</p>
        <p>The program has been lauded by many for its success in drawing talented people into the field of education, and as former Chicago School Board President and current U.S. Secretary of Education <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/corps-member-and-alumni-resources/alumni-summits/20th-anniversary-summit">Arne Duncan</a> said, "making teaching cool again." <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/newsroom/documents/obama_teachforamerica.htm">President Obama</a> praised TFA corps members as "a generation of activists possessed with that most American of ideas -- that people who love their country can change it." In 2010, TFA was awarded a $50 million <a href="http://apps.tfanet.org/federalfunding/">"scale-up" grant</a>, to be paid over four years, through the U.S. Department of Education's Investing in Innovation competition. Their political support is almost ubiquitous.</p>

<p>But not everyone is as enthusiastic about the benefits of Teach for America. Here in Chicago, the program has come under criticism from the Chicago Teachers Union, community members, and even TFA alumni, who say TFA's rapid push to expand has betrayed its founding ideals. </p>

<p><strong>Insurgency</strong><br />
When the organization was started by Princeton Alum Wendy Kopp in 1989, its original mission was to promote education justice by bringing talented teachers to schools who couldn't attract an adequate supply of qualified teaching applicants on their own. </p>

<p>A lot has changed in Chicago's education ecosphere since the '90s, however. Nowadays major budget cuts, layoffs, and school closings in Chicago have left an absence of vacant teaching positions. The added influx of TFA corps in the city means they now compete head-to-head for jobs with traditional teachers. </p>

<p>Since arriving in Chicago with 34 recruits in 2000, TFA's numbers have surged to a <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/where-we-work/chicago">corps size</a> of 500 this year, with over 1,700 alumni in the region. </p>

<p>CTU President <a href="http://www.wbez.org/story/news/education/chicago-teachers-union-president-slams-uno-team-teach-america">Karen Lewis</a> has been critical of the organization's growth for displacing veteran teachers, saying, "Obviously we're not under-served or understaffed or under-resourced in terms of teachers, and I thought that was the whole purpose behind TFA -- to provide teachers in areas that are under-resourced?"</p>

<p>In light of recent deep cuts to Illinois education budgets, there is considerable financial motivation for Chicago principals to replace experienced teachers with <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/why-teach-for-america/compensation-and-benefits">TFA recruits</a>, who work for less than veteran teachers, particularly those with tenure.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/teach-for-america-is-great-just-not-for-my-kid/2012/03/07/gIQA1Xr0xR_blog.html">Critics</a> oppose the trend of replacing experienced teachers with TFA corps members who only receive four to five weeks of training prior to being thrust into some of the neediest schools in the city, and who come and go every two years. There's no continuity, no authority that students recognize, they say. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-organization/research">Teach For America</a> has responded to the criticism by shifting promotional focus towards the higher quality of instruction their corps members bring to the table, insisting their recruits are more effective in the classroom than non TFA teachers.</p>

<p>But after almost two decades of sending their minimally trained elite college graduates into struggling schools across the county, the non-partisan data on TFA corp members' success is mixed at best.</p>

<p>In one of the most <a href="http://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/teach-for-america">comprehensive studies</a> on the matter, professors of education Julian Vasquez Heilig and Su Jin Jez found that TFA recruits generally perform equally to other non credentialed beginning teachers. TFA recruits did slightly better in math instruction than similarly situated teachers. However, Vasquez Heilig and Jin Jez's 2010 study found that TFA corps members performed less well than credentialed beginning teachers, and significantly less well than experienced teachers. </p>

<p>In the handful of instances where data does back up TFA's lofty claims, those positive academic results occurred in charter schools with vastly more resources than neighborhood schools, thanks to private wealthy donors. </p>

<p><strong>Ideology</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/our-mission/a-solvable-problem">Teach For America</a> doesn't accept poverty as an excuse for low academic performance, believing instead that its elite recruits can come into any needy school and turn student performances around. Many critics have called that notion misguided and paternalistic. </p>

<p>Aside from TFA, most people agree that the <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-10-06/opinion/ct-perspec-1006-urban-20111006_1_poor-children-graduation-rate-gap">effects of urban poverty</a> run deeper than school. They can't simply be wished or worked away by motivated, well intentioned outsiders. TFA's refusal to see socio-economic class as a relevant factor in education reform puts all the blame for low student performance squarely on the shoulders of teachers. </p>

<p>Critics point to <a href="http://www.rtinetwork.org/learn/diversity/urban-school-challenges">studies</a> examining the complexity of low income urban education. They argue that just because students in low income communities struggle with academic success doesn't mean their teachers are failing them. The system is failing them. On a daily basis, Chicago students in low income communities face structural and cultural obstacles like segregation, homelessness, violence, hunger, and abuse that make traditional academic success very challenging, regardless of how good a teacher may be.</p>

<p><strong>Privatization</strong><br />
In 2010, the <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-09-27/news/ct-met-charter-teachers-20100927_1_charter-schools-teacher-certification-city-teachers-union">United Neighborhood Organization</a> (UNO) charter school was the first privately managed Chicago charter to officially partner up with TFA, who agreed to supply 25 corps to fill 25 teaching openings at the school. CTU blasted CPS for hiring the TFA recruits on the heels of laying off hundreds of veteran teachers, 600 of whom were still looking for jobs.</p>

<p>Not only are TFA corps members increasing their presence in Chicago's charter schools, but many charter principals and founders are themselves TFA alumni. This is thanks largely to TFA's 2006 <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/corps-member-and-alumni-resources/alumni-leadership-initiatives/educational-leadership/school-leadership-initiative">School Leadership Initiative</a>, which set out to increase the number of TFA alumni in school leadership positions by "fostering structured relationships with district, charter, and graduate school partners." As part of that initiative, Harvard Graduate School of Education in partnership with TFA and CPS crafted the <a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/assets/documents/HGSE.CPS.Overview.pdf">Principal Leadership Pipeline</a>, outlining a "fast-track path to school leadership" for TFA alumni to "become principals in targeted areas within Chicago Public Schools."</p>

<p>In the wake of the Chicago School Board's recent decision to close 50 schools and axe school budgets, this rise of privately operated charter schools is being met with increased opposition in the city. </p>

<p>When asked why so many successful TFA alumni opened charter schools rather than working for reform within the public schools, TFA founder and CEO <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2011/02/teach-for-america-wendy-kopp">Wendy Kopp</a> praised charter schools for "giving educators the freedom and flexibility that they need to attain results." She has referred to her critics and critics of charters as defenders of the status quo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eduwonk.com/2012/12/karen-lewis-on-sandy-hook-teach-for-america-kills.html">Karen Lewis</a> slams TFA's partnership with charters for feeding the momentum to shut down neighborhood schools, fire career teachers, marginalize the teacher's union, and turn more schools over to privately managed charters, many of which have been conveniently opened TFA alums. She says that impetus exacerbates the violence, disenfranchisement, and divestment in our city's low income communities.</p>

<p>TFA's influence on charter proliferation has alarmed many at a policy level as well. Groups like the <a href="http://www.edliberation.org/">Education for Liberation Network</a> point to TFA's political connectedness, their deep pocketed policy lobbying efforts, and their top down push to privatize public education, as factors that have contributed towards Chicago's political embrace of charters. Education activists and privatization opponents have organized a summit at this summer's <a href="http://www.fmfp.org/">Free Minds Free People 2013 Conference</a> in Chicago to address the TFA/charter problem.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/where-we-work/chicago">Teach For America's</a> "vision for Chicago is to be the catalyst for system-wide change." With strong political support, 500 active corps members, more than 850 alumni teachers, 60 alumni principals, and 49 alumni assistant principals, there is no doubt TFA is helping lead an educational revolution in Chicago's schools. But a grassroots, progressive revolution it is not. This could only be described as a top-down revolution; a bourgeois revolution. One that is helping to privatize education, an essential public good. </p>

<p>Intentionally or not, TFA has bolstered conservative education reform pedagogy by perpetuating the belief that teacher's unions are stalling quality education reform; that bad teachers are to blame for low student achievement; that economic inequality is an inconsequential factor for education reform; and that education reform is best left to private entities.</p>

<p>Why would tens of thousands of bright college graduates with altruistic ideals enlist as soldiers in this conservative revolution? <a href="http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2011/10/31/why-i-did-tfa-and-why-you-shouldnt/">Gary Rubinstein</a>, a veteran teacher, TFA alumni, and prominent critic of the program explains his motivations as many do:</p>

<blockquote><p>"It sounded exciting. For once, I'd be doing something 'real.' I'd be doing something valuable for society. I'd be making a difference."</p></blockquote>

<p>Rubenstein laments that these days, TFA corps don't understand the negative impact of their participation in the organization because TFA itself doesn't accept the veracity of those consequences. It's spearheaded the largest liberal education reform movement of our time without asking the big questions. <br />
 	<br />
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. That is Teach For America's unfortunate irony. In its mission to enact progressive education reform and eliminate the cycle of poverty, it has advanced a conservative agenda that seeks to privatize education, undercut teachers unions, and fuel the decline of the American labor movement.  </p>

        <p>Food assistance funding is now on the chopping block. In a state that is crippled by fiscal failures and a heavy pension crisis, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is facing a total of $20 billion in cuts over 10 years, harming soup kitchens, food pantries and needy families. <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/early-and-often/politics/watch-reps-duckworth-foster-and-kelly-oppose-slashing-of-20-billion-in-food-assistance/">Three democratic leaders</a> took a stand this week urging Congress to rethink their actions. Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) and Bill Foster (D-Illinois) who represent different districts opposed the plan citing two million families will be affected. </p>

<p>Those who oppose government assistance will be the first to accuse liberals of instituting government dependency not understanding how some families literally have nothing. There are children who are being bred in a life of poverty in the world's richest country. It's not just a matter of creating an enabling mentality but there are few employment opportunities in many neighborhoods, slim transportation options and various other factors that contribute to a family's financial demise. It's impractical to cut food assistance without providing alternatives such as a co-op, eliminating food deserts, constructing affordable farmer's markets and perhaps waiting until the recipient is employed or finds a higher-paying job. </p>
        <p>Food stamps are another entity of government assistance initiative that has been under fire for their inability to offer advancement and continual giving without requiring work on behalf of recipients.  Other issues such as the medical card and Section 8 housing are more costly. Food, healthcare and housing are indeed a human right but a workforce fuels the economy. Although, some conservatives prefer to erase all the welfare programs, Food assistance makes a huge difference for low-income families because a $100 worth of food can pay the water bill, put gas in the car and maybe purchase shoes for the children. </p>

<p>Yes, there should be a cap on various other programs such as the medical card because it makes it incredibly easy for women to continually produce children without bearing hospital expenses. And yes, the lifetime guarantee of Section 8 can possibly erode the incentive to work, save money and plan for the future. However, it's impossible to take away necessity without providing resources for self-sufficiency because it will not reap long-term benefits for communities. </p>

        <p><img alt="IMG_3815.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/IMG_3815.jpg" width="350" class="right" />Dozens of activists protested and gathered toilet paper donations outside the Chase Auditorium in downtown Chicago on Tuesday, at an event where Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/tribnation/chi-chicago-forward-pass-or-fail-for-the-chicago-public-schools-20130619,0,2506382.story">spoke with <em>Tribune</em> editorial page editor Bruce Dold about her plans for the CPS</a>. The event protesters gathered outside of was sponsored by ComEd and the <em>Tribune</em>.</p>

<p>Protesters blasted the plan for deep budget cuts that would put many schools in untenable situations. Demonstrators collected toilet paper donations as a nod to the fact that these budget cuts would leave many schools stretched so thin they'd be unable to pay for even the most basic of supplies--including janitorial supplies like toilet paper. </p>

<p>According to the <em>Tribune</em>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/education/ct-met-chicago-forward-byrd-bennett-20130619,0,5611968.story">Byrd-Bennett is going to look into reports</a> of cuts to funding for toilet paper.</p>
        <p><img alt="CPS budget cut protester - 6/18/13" src="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/IMG_3811.jpg" width="350" class="left" />The <a href="http://www.cps.edu/about_cps/the_board_of_education/pages/thechicagoboardofeducation.aspx">Chicago Board of Education</a> announced its <a href="http://www.wbez.org/news/chicago-schools-facing-cuts-under-new-funding-system-107692">new budget</a> last Friday aimed at reducing a deficit of nearly $1 billion. On that same day it was announced <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/20741706-418/850-teachers-staffers-get-pink-slips-at-closing-turnaround-schools.html">850 CPS employees will be laid off</a> due to school closings and turnarounds, including 420 teachers. School budgets will also be cut (on a sliding scale based on factors like enrollment) at schools across the city.</p>

<p>Principals, who have been given total autonomy over their budgets for the first time, will have to make unprecedented cutbacks. According to a <a href="http://www.ctunet.com/blog/mayor-cps-to-impose-massive-cuts-on-school-budgets-refuse-to-advocate-for-other-accessible-revenue-streams">statement from the Chicago Teachers Union</a>, at least 20 schools will see significant budget reductions, with some schools getting hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars less than previous years. </p>

<p>CTU officials point out that principals will be forced to cut costs from somewhere, and because school employee salaries account for the bulk of operational costs many jobs are on the line. CTU Vice President <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/06/15/850-teachers-and-staff-laid-off-from-Chicago-Public-Schools/UPI-73281371330377/">Jesse Sharkey</a> predicts these cutbacks could result in 1,000 to 2,000 additional teacher layoffs.</p>

<p>Many city residents see these cuts to education essentials like teachers and toilet paper as counterproductive to building an effective education system. At Tuesday's protest, one demonstrator named Mark said the district simply couldn't slash school budgets and simultaneously expect student performance and education quality to improve.  </p>

<p>Speaking at the City Club of Chicago Tuesday, CTU President <a href="http://www.ctunet.com/pdf/Karen-Lewis_CIty-Club-of-Chicago_6-18.pdf">Karen Lewis</a> offered an alternative to school budget cuts, and called on Byrd-Bennett and Mayor Rahm Emanuel to take advantage of existing new revenue streams like fair taxation, renegotiation of <a href="http://www.progressillinois.com/news/content/2013/05/21/activists-meet-bank-america-executives-over-cps-toxic-swap-agreements">swap deals</a> between CPS and predatory bank lenders, reallocation of <a href="http://chicagocouncilmatic.org/search/?q=&topics=Tax%20Increment%20Financing">tax increment financing</a>, and revival of a <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3548&GAID=11&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=84&GA=97">Financial Transaction Tax bill</a> in Springfield to close their budget gap. She urged the mayor's office to join with CTU to lobby for these progressive finance reforms, rather than sourcing revenue from strapped school budgets.<br />
 <br />
"Continuing CPS policies and budgetary priorities that disinvest in neighborhood schools have failed to serve most students and need to be discontinued," Lewis said.  </p>
