<div>There was no lack of inspiration heading into Sunday’s matchup with the Miami Dolphins.  Coach Chuck Pagano was in attendance and it showed in the play of the Colts.  No one shined brighter than rookie quarterback Andrew Luck, who threw for an NFL rookie record 433 yards.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“I mentioned before the game that you guys were living in a vision, and you weren’t living in circumstances,” Pagano said after Sunday’s big win.  “You know where they had us in the beginning, every last one of them.  But you refused to live in circumstances and you decided consciously as a team and as a family to live in a vision, and that’s why you bring things home like what you brought home today.  That’s why you’re already champions and well on your way.”  It was a very emotional scene.  Many players later said that they cried during the emotional post-game speech.  “I’ve got circumstances.  You guys understand it, I understand it.  It’s already beat.  It’s already beat.  My vision that I’m living is to see two more daughters get married, dance at their weddings and then lift the Lombardi Trophy several times.  I’m dancing at two more weddings and we’re hoisting that trophy together, men.  Congratulations, I love all of you.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Andrew Luck showed us again why he is wise beyond his years during his post-game interview.  You wouldn’t know the young quarterback had just broken Cam Newton’s rookie record.  He was just concerned with playing well for his ailing coach, who has been receiving treatment for leukemia since late September.  “His presence is felt every day in the facility, but to see him in the flesh, in the locker room, to hear him speak I think gave all the guys a boost.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Luck and the Colts had arguably their best overall game of the season, even better than the win against Green Bay.  Luck tied a rookie record held by former Colt Peyton Manning, for the most 300 yard pass games in a rookie season (4).  Luck’s 433 pass yards weren’t even his best stat of the game.  The young quarterback was an amazing 13-19 on third down, many of those third and longs.  He was also 30-48 and threw for two scores, one to Reggie Wayne, the other, a 36 yard bomb to fellow rookie, T.Y. Hilton.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Dolphins didn’t seem to have an answer for the Colts offense.  “We knew we’d have to disrupt him a little bit.  But we weren’t detailed enough, we weren’t disciplined enough on our rush.  When you have the number one defense on third down, and when a team converts 69% of the time on third down, it’s a different feel.” said Dolphins first year coach, Joe Philbin.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The matchup between two potential AFC playoff teams was a battle throughout.  There were over 800 total yards between the two teams and neither turned the ball over.  The defense came up huge in the fourth quarter, stopping the Dolphins on their final two drives as they trailed by only three.  Robert Mathis sacked Ryan Tannehill to make eight straight games that the Colts defensive stud has a sack.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1352147920119_102">It will be a short week for the Colts.  We travel to Jacksonville to play the Jaguars on Thursday Night Football.  The Colts will be seeking revenge after a heartbreaking loss to the Jags, 22-17 in week 3.  It was the first loss of the season for the Jaguars (1-7).  The Colts were a much different team then.  Our offense has found itself and it seems like Luck’s chemistry with his receiving core gets stronger every week.  The Jaguars are allowing nearly 400 total yards a game (393), so it will be interesting to see how aggressive the Colts pass attack will be Thursday.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Colts are 5-3, and although it hasn’t all been pretty, we are in the playoff hunt and we aren’t going anywhere.  Oh and by the way, if the playoffs started this weekend, you know who we’d be matched up with? Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos. Weird.</div>

<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_493">After a night featuring a championship ring ceremony on the east coast and a shocking defeat on the west coast, a bulk of NBA teams tipped off their season tonight. More importantly, the Indiana Pacers, who face greater expectations than in years past but face the beginning of the season without Danny Granger as well, tipped off their season tonight in Toronto as they took on the Raptors.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_502">
<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_504">Defense reigned supreme tonight as each team was held well below 100 points. With just 3 players scoring in double digits, Pacer points were at a premium tonight. David west led the way with 25 big points followed by Paul George and Roy Hibbert each dropping 14 points. Paul George also racked up 15 rebounds giving him a double-double and even distributed five assists. Hibbert, who grabbed nine rebounds, just missed his first double-double of the season. The Raptors received double digit points from five players tonight, two more than Indiana, but received minimal production from the rest of their team. Kyle Lowry led the way for Toronto tonight as he scored 21 points. Raptor center, Jonas Valanciunas, put up 12 points and 10 rebounds giving him his first double-double for his career.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_505">
<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_507">While it was no offensive gem to watch, the Pacers made a spirited comeback in the fourth quarter capped off by a clutch game winning jumper in the lane with 2.1 seconds left by George Hill to win 90-88. The Pacers out rebounded, had a better shooting percentage, and more assists which carried them to victory tonight. The loss of Granger seemed evident tonight though as Indiana struggled to score for most of the night. The lack of offense shouldn’t scare Pacer fans; however, as the team won’t be an offensive force and every team has bad games from time to time. Paul George showed off his improved game though which helped lessen the blow. Roy Hibbert and David West displayed their trademark toughness down low as well. While it was no game to brag about, the Pacers pulled out a hard-fought victory as they begin their quest for a title.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_508">
<p id="yui_3_7_2_7_1351797562367_510"><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Player of the Game:</span></b> Paul George. Shooting guard Paul George clearly asserted himself tonight. Scoring 14 points (ten in the first quarter), grabbing 15 rebounds, and dishing five assists, George showed force, skill, and flair as he led his team to victory. Posting his first double-double of the season, George led all players in rebounds and finished second in scoring. He earns a much deserved player of the game.</p>

<p>By: JF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had been seven long, ugly seasons.  That&#8217;s how long the Pacers had gone without winning a playoff series.  That all changed last year.  Now, the Pacers are ready to take the next step.  Indiana went 42-24 last year, finishing with the third best record in the Eastern Conference.  The Pacers beat Orlando in the first round before losing to LeBron James and the eventual champion, Miami Heat.</p>
<p>With Derrick Rose missing a big part of the season for last year&#8217;s Central Division champion Bulls, the Pacers believe they can bring the Central Division banner back to Indiana.  &#8221;From looking at a playoff standpoint, we got to the second round last year, so we&#8217;re hoping to get further than that.  We got a third seed in the regular season and we&#8217;re hoping to do better than that,&#8221; coach Frank Vogel said.</p>
<p>The Pacers took a big hit earlier this week after finding out that they would be missing last year&#8217;s leading scorer, Danny Granger (18.7 ppg).  Granger missed most of the preseason and will seek a second opinion on his ailing knee.  With the absence of Granger, expect Roy Hibbert and Paul George to take bigger roles in the Pacer offense.  Gerald Green will replace Granger in the starting lineup to join George Hill, David West, George, and Hibbert.  For the Pacers to go to the next level, they need Paul George to play a more substantial role, so it will be interesting to see how he reacts when given the reins.</p>
<p>Toronto went 23-43 last season, losing all three meetings with the Pacers.  They&#8217;ve added some new faces in Kyle Lowry, Landry Fields, and John Lucas.  Another new face is Jonas Valanciunas of Lithuania.  The 7&#8217;0&#8243; rookie center will likely guard Hibbert most of the game.  Look for the Pacers to go at this match-up aggressively.  The Pacers will likely run their offense through Roy, exploiting the match-up with the young rookie center.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting time to be a Pacer fan.  After last season&#8217;s success, the Pacers have expectations this year, something they haven&#8217;t had since the Reggie Miller days (Oh, how we miss those days).  The Pacers know they don&#8217;t have any media acclaimed &#8220;superstars.&#8221;  They know that in order to achieve success, they have to play well as a unit, not as individuals.  &#8221;We have something special here,&#8221; said Paul George.  &#8221;That makes it even more exciting knowing that everybody&#8217;s on the same page.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look for the Pacers to go after Toronto early.  Pacers win their home opener big, 96-82.</p>

<p>By: Jeff Ranger</p>
<p>A day we have been waiting for since LeBron and Company won the first of not five, not six championships has arrived. The NBA tips off today. An off-season filled with blockbuster moves has put us on the edge of our seats as the magic day arrives. What will this season bring? Who will win the West? Who will win the East? More importantly, however, who will win the most coveted accomplishment in basketball, the NBA Finals?</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The East:</span></b> Unlike the West, the East is easier to predict. Obviously the favorite is the defending champion Miami Heat especially with the additions of sharp shooter, Ray Allen, and former great, Rashard Lewis. Not to mention they still have the most talented player in the league sporting their uniform. The Heat, however, can be derailed in the blink of an eye if the injury bug comes to town. Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, the other members of the Big Three, are coming off injuries, which barred them from Olympic play. Also, Ray Allen was on and off the court last year; as was Mike Miller, who we saw limp around the court in the playoffs. Miami isn’t necessarily a lock to repeat as Champions this year.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Real Contenders:</span></b> The Chicago Bulls, who would have been the favorite to attempt to knock off Miami if Derrick Rose hadn’t been injured, have definitely taken a step back this year without him and won’t factor too much in the East. Not many teams match up well with the Heat anyway. Before the return of Bosh in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Boston Celtics were on the verge of dethroning the King and his boys. With the “betrayal” of Ray Allen, the Celtics have even more motivation this year to go toe-to-toe with almighty Miami. The Indiana Pacers, who have a big size advantage, might be the team that matches up best with the Heat. Sporting 7 foot 2 inch Roy Hibbert in the paint, Miami has no defense to stop him. Also, with another year of development for Paul George, a breakout year might be in store for the young guard, which could spell trouble for the rest of the league. If anyone can stop Miami, it just might be the Pacers.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eastern Conference Pick:</span></b> Miami Heat. For a third straight season, I foresee Miami representing the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals. It won’t be an easy task, however, as I see injuries take their toll at times and a tough match up with the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Although Indiana lacks the athleticism compared to Miami, the Pacer starters really played well against them last season. Coupled with the Pacers’ immense toughness and size advantage, not to mention coaching advantage, Miami will be in for a fight. One more year before the Pacers can get over the hump. Heat take the East.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The West:</span></b> Wow. How can one predict this conference? The Lakers made huge splashes this off-season with the trading of big man, Andrew Bynum, in order to land future Hall of Famer, Steve Nash, and Mr. Indecision, Dwight Howard. With basically a Big Four consisting of Kobe, Nash, Gasol, and Howard, the Lakers seemed poised to make another run at it all before Kobe eventually retires. Another deal shaking up the West was the trading of sixth man of the year, James Harden, to the Rockets. Not only do the Thunder lose a member of their Big Three, but they also really didn&#8217;t get anything in immediate return. Oklahoma City and Los Angeles are clearly the two teams to beat, but the West does have depth and no one is safe. For example, the San Antonio Spurs had the best regular season record last season and are always in the mix. The Los Angeles Clippers return with another year of development for their big front court  and return arguably the best point guard in the league, Chris Paul. The Nuggets added Andre Igoudala and the Rockets added Jeremy Lin and James Harden. Don’t’ forget about young stars, Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio, over in Minnesota. The West certainly is wild.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Real Contenders:</span></b> Only two main contenders really will be put down here, the Lakers and the Thunder. The Spurs sputtered at the end last year due to age, and the Lakers and Thunder just seem too dominant this year to allow another team to come in and push them around. The Thunder, defending Western Conference Champions, have one of the best young players in the league; while the Lakers have the best center in the game as well as one of the greatest players of all time. The Western Conference Finals should be between these two teams without a doubt.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Western Conference Pick:</span></b> Los Angeles Lakers. Due to the loss of Harden, I don’t believe the Thunder can beat the Lakers this season. Howard and Gasol will dominate down low, Nash will dish the ball left and right to a more than willing shooter in Kobe, and Bryant is very hungry for another title on his quest to be better than Jordan. Unless injuries really affect LA, which could very possibly happen, I think they will roll through the West this year on their way to another Finals appearance.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1351493731015_366"><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Finals Pick:</span></b> Miami Heat. Let’s face it, the Heat are just straight up talented. Boasting the most gifted player of all time in LeBron James and offensive weapons left and right, the Heat can dismantle the Lakers. The Lakers do have an immense size advantage which can dominate the Heat, but the Heat have too much offensive fire power to be stopped. If everything collapses inside, a pass out to Allen, Miller, or whomever will more than likely put three points on the board for the Heat. LeBron is hungrier than before and has the better, deeper team. Heat repeat as Champions and LeBron wins another Finals MVP.</p>

<p>As Colts fans, we&#8217;ve all dealt with the change at quarterback our own special way.  We still remember that despondent press conference.  As a city, it knocked the wind out of us.  That feeling didn&#8217;t last very long.  Andrew Luck has been fantastic.  He&#8217;s exceeded all expectations and has already doubled last year&#8217;s win total (2).  I&#8217;m sure no one has taken as big of a sigh of relief as Colts owner, Jim Irsay.  Even though Luck has excelled, it still stings to see number 18 in that ugly, burnt orange.  I&#8217;ve heard, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Colts fan, not a Peyton Manning fan&#8230;&#8221;  Show some appreciation.  Peyton has done so much for not just the Colts, but for the city of Indianapolis.  He started the Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital at St.Vincent in 2003.  One could argue that the Colts wouldn&#8217;t even be in Indianapolis had we drafted Ryan Leaf.  There most certainly wouldn&#8217;t be a new stadium without Manning, which in turn means that the city would never have gotten a bid to host the Super Bowl.  I&#8217;ve also seen people who have bought Manning Bronco jerseys as opposed to Luck&#8217;s Colts jersey (At one point in the season, Manning and Luck had the top two selling jerseys in the NFL).  This isn&#8217;t an Andrew Luck/Peyton Manning comparison.  This is a Peyton Manning story.  Specifically, I&#8217;m going to explain why Peyton could very well add to his NFL record, four Most Valuable Player Awards.  No one deserves it more.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to be happy for Peyton.  No one was 100% certain how he was going to bounce back after missing all of last season.  Four neck surgeries? What about his arm strength? Can he even withstand a big hit? Peyton has shown us that the injury is no longer an issue and looks better than ever.  After last night&#8217;s dominant performance against New Orleans, Peyton is once again in the mix for the league&#8217;s most coveted individual award.  Peyton has won four previous MVP awards (2003, 2004, 2008, 2009), more than any other player in NFL history.  If you average his numbers from those four seasons here&#8217;s what you get: 67.1% completion rate, 4,331.5 yards, 34.5 TDs and 12 INTs with a QB rating of 103.75.  Through Denver&#8217;s first seven games, Peyton has a 68.5% completion rate, thrown for 2,113 yards for 17 TDs and 4 INTs with a QB rating of 109.0.  He&#8217;s on pace to throw for 4,830 yards (which would be a career-high), 39 TDs, and just 9 INTs (which would tie for a career-low).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only going to get easier for Manning.  Of the Broncos nine remaining games, they only have one against a team with a winning record (Baltimore).  Three of those final nine games are against arguably, the two worst teams in the league (Kansas City and Cleveland).  If the last four weeks were any indication, defenses beware.  Manning has thrown for 300+ yards and 3 TDs for four consecutive weeks.  Manning&#8217;s only competition at the moment appears to be Matt Ryan of Atlanta.  They have very similar numbers, except for one thing, wins.  The Falcons are the only remaining unbeaten team left.  They have a much tougher schedule in the second half of the season compared to Denver.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be very interesting to see how Peyton finishes this season.  The Broncos could easily win-out and finish 13-3.  He&#8217;s finally building a chemistry with his receivers like we saw for all those years in Indianapolis.  Denver is going to be a very scary team come December and January.  No one is going to want to square off against Peyton during the playoffs.  If anyone in the AFC can beat the Texans at home, it&#8217;s Denver.  It may just be a two-horse race for the Most Valuable Player award.  No one has ever won the MVP with two different teams, but if anyone can do it, it&#8217;s Peyton.<a name="pd_a_6648374"></a>
