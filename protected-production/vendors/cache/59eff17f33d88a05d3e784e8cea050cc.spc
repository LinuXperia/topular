<p>Locating historic photographs of certain intersections in Indianapolis is nearly impossible. They are either off the beaten path, building owners had not hired professional photographers, or existing collections have not yet been located. And sadly many photograph collections have been ~shudder~ discarded. So as a photo historian I’m thrilled when new collections become available to the public. I imagine that the photographer who documented power lines for Indianapolis Power and Light in the 1920s and ‘30s would be amused to find his utilitarian images enjoyed for historic purposes ninety years later.</p>
<p>These two historic photographs come from the collection of Dee Dee Davis, who loaned them to IUPUI’s University Library for scanning. The album contains Indianapolis Power and Light photographs from 1927, 1935, and 1936 documenting the consolidation of power lines, which by the 1920s visually cluttered the streets. In about 1935 IPL reduced the number of lines and eliminated or cut off many of the wood poles, usually on just one side of the street.</p>

<p>In 1927 the IPL photographer aimed his camera north on North Illinois Street at the intersection of West 30<sup>th</sup> Street. This appears to be a “before” picture of the electric poles. Visible businesses on the east side of Illinois Street include Western Union, Fletcher Savings and Trust Company, and the Tasty Bakery (listed as the Frank R. Knoth restaurant in the 1930 city directory). Note the streetcar tracks and the overhead wires directly above them for electric trolleys.

<p>The same scene was rephotographed in 1936 after the tops of some of the wood poles have been chopped off. The Fletcher Bank has been spruced up with new awnings and different signage. Western Union remains on the southeast corner and the city directory does not list a restaurant, but a sign advertises some product as “ALWAYS 15” cents.

<p>I’m always curious to type the street names into Google Street View to discover what currently exists on the site. Today, dinosaurs burst forth from the “Dinosphere” to welcome visitors to The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis. The rounded structure was converted into the Dinosphere exhibit from an existing CineDome large-format IMAX theater in 2004. (Google Street View, 2009)</p>

<p>Since Georgia has been on my mind as city leaders contemplate a new name for Georgia Street, I could not help notice the creative signage at this intersection. The official names are “Illinois Street” and “30<sup>th</sup> Street,” but the streets have alternate names in honor of the dinosaur exhibit. “T. Rex Trail” and “Gorgosaurus Avenue” are seen on smaller signs. Perhaps the city could make the disgruntled public happy by branding the new Georgia Street public venue in this manner, or via banners, and leave the historic street name on the books. (Google Street View ca. 2009)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>A</strong> settler from Virginia by way of Kentucky, Jeremiah Johnson brought his family to central Indiana in 1821, not long after the state legislature voted to relocate the state capitol from Corydon in southern Indiana to a swampy square mile of land near the junction of the White River and Fall Creek. Johnson and three of his sons claimed an 80 acre plot of land two miles north of the fledgling capitol city, along the western bank of Fall Creek. The following year, after land was cleared, cabins were built and corn planted, Johnson and his sons moved the rest of their family to their homestead, including his one year old grandson, Oliver.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>O</strong>liver Johnson&#8217;s adventures, growing up in the wilderness that was once 38th and Fall Creek, is retold by his grandson Howard Johnson in the 1951 Indiana Historical Society publication &#8220;A Home in the Woods&#8221;, a book I highly recommend for parent or teachers of small children to learn of pioneer Indianapolis. It&#8217;s short, it&#8217;s sweet; two things history books rarely are and I&#8217;ll post an link to an online copy of it at the bottom of this article. However, for today&#8217;s purposes, let&#8217;s jump ahead to Oliver Johnson, all grown up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>A</strong> 25 year old Oliver purchased his own plot of land a short distance west of his father&#8217;s property in 1846 and later built a traditional five-bay farmhouse for his family in 1862. Oliver farmed his land as Indianapolis quickly grew outward from its one square mile beginnings. By the turn of the century, the aging farmer saw opportunity in the city&#8217;s northward sprawl. After all, his father&#8217;s property, just east of his own, had just recently been repurposed. In 1892 what was once Jeremiah Johnson&#8217;s homestead hosted its first fair as the new Indiana State Fairgrounds. An enterprising Oliver and sons platted (subdivided) the property in 1909, selling a portion of it to the city for an interurban rail-line linking Indianapolis and the Village of Broad Ripple down College Ave. Oliver&#8217;s farmhouse, which had originally come to face Central Ave. was purchased by a new owner and moved to face Park Ave. where it sits today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>O</strong>liver Johnson&#8217;s plots were quickly scooped up by a wide variety of successful immigrants, business owners and auto industry leaders who had grown prosperous as the city had grown. The huge variety of houses constructed in such a small area is a salve for eyes sore of cookie-cutter housing divisions that pepper the fringes of the city and is a walking history of early 20th century residential architecture, a definite must see on the long list of historic neighborhoods throughout Indianapolis.</p>

However, Fannie Mustard Johnson was the granddaughter of James Mustard, who apparently owned a large amount of land around Indianapolis.  ~ Barbara Mackenzie, Rohnert Park, CA </em></p>
<p><strong>HI&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>
<p>There were eight original patent holders of the parcels of land that would one day become Crown Hill Cemetery.  All of the owners bought their acreage from the federal government in the same year, 1822.  The purchasers were Abraham Barnett, Joseph Hanna, Thomas McQuat, William Nugent, William D. Rooker, William Sanders, Levi Wright, and Noah Wright.</p>

<p>Over the years, most of the initial owners sold their properties.  By the time an updated map of Marion County was produced in 1855, the title holders of those same eight parcels were John Armstrong, U. Blue&#8217;s Heirs, Bennett Byram, Moses Foley, Noah Noble&#8217;s Heirs, Peter Ruark, Martin Williams, and Levi Wright.</p>
<p>In 1863, Crown Hill Cemetery was incorporated, the ownership had changed again.  The initial parcels of land that were purchased to establish the cemetery were owned by farmers Jonathan Wilson, Martin Williams, and James Trueblood.  By year&#8217;s end, the cemetery&#8217;s first superintendent and his family moved into a cabin on the cemetery grounds.  In the spring of the following year, 1864, the cemetery was dedicated, and the first burial was conducted on the following day.</p>
<p>In subsequent years, additional acreage was purchased from Henry and Levi Wright, Dorman M. Davidson, Edwin J. Armstrong and others, Bennett Byram, F. M. Finch, John and Mary Gray, A. and E. Burchard, G. A. Donley, Joseph Corzon, and A. L. Wright.  Still later purchases from William Foley et al, Mary H. Ruddell, and Fred and Bernie E. Cline extended the cemetery grounds north of Maple Road (later known as 38th Street).</p>

<p>Fannie Mustard Johnson was born in 1871.  Since most of Crown Hill&#8217;s land purchases were made either before Fannie was born or when she was still a minor, it does not seem possible that Fannie could have owned property that became a part of Crown Hill Cemetery.  Neither does it appear that anyone named Mustard or Johnson was involved in any of the cemetery&#8217;s acquisitions.</p>

<p>According to several published histories, the Mustard family came to Marion County, Indiana, in 1834, from Washington County, Pennsylvania.  The patriarch of the family was James Mustard (1797-1841).  He had two sons and four daughters by his first wife, Dorothy Swartz Mustard (1796-1827), and five sons by his second wife, Elizabeth Craig Goble Mustard (1797-18??).  James Mustard purchased about 250 acres directly south of the towns of Broad Ripple and Wellington.  This is the only land I could find that the elder James Mustard owned before he passed away in 1841.  At the time of an 1855 map, the land was owned by J. Mustard&#8217;s Heirs.</p>

<p>At the time the next available map was printed in 1889, the Mustards had acquired additional parcels of land in Washington Township, totalling nearly 400 acres.  As the population of Indianapolis grew, the areas north of the city limits of 38th Street became desirable.  By the 1920s, most of the land owned by the Mustards had been developed.  The parcels north of the White River became the Arden neighborhood, Sherwood Village, a portion of the Town of Meridian Hills, and Marott Park.  The parcels south of the White River became various smaller housing additions in what are now the Meridian-Kessler and Butler-Tarkington neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Sadly, Fannie Mustard Johnson died of mitral insufficiency on August 19, 1916, at the relatively young age of 45, leaving two minor children, Harold and Alma.  Harold died just two years after his mother.  Alma went on to marry Manuel F. McGoldrick and rear two daughters.  Fannie&#8217;s widower Walter married again to Lydia Blanche Overman, and they had a son they named Walter S. Johnson, Jr.  Fannie, Harold, Alma and Walter are all buried in <a title="Crown Hill Cemetery" href="http://www.crownhill.org/" target="_blank">Crown Hill Cemetery</a>.</p>

<p>Although there may well be descendents of the 19th-century Mustards who still own property in Washington Township today, there is no longer anyone named Mustard living in the area.  About the only structure still standing that keeps the Mustard name alive is the former Masonic Lodge at 6235 Guilford Avenue.  The three-story brick building was erected in 1907 with a gift of $25,000, which was left to the Broad Ripple Lodge by Jacob S. Mustard in his will.  The edifice was named Mustard Hall in his memory.  Jacob died on August 20, 1904.  Jacob&#8217;s wife, Cassandra Coil Mustard, died on September 21, 1920.  Cassandra was the daughter of Jacob Coil, the man credited with founding Broad Ripple in 1837.  They are buried together in <a title="Union Chapel Cemetery" href="http://www.unionchapelcemetery.com/" target="_blank">Union Chapel Cemetery</a>, about which there was a recent Historic Indianapolis article <a title="here" href="http://historicindianapolis.com/union-chapel-cemetery/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Although the 106-year-old Broad Ripple Village landmark  is now privately owned and no longer serves as a lodge, many locals still refer to the building as Mustard Hall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not too long ago, in the days before there was a television on every smartphone, it was a rarity for a household to have more than one television.  This advertisement, from 1953, encourages the consumer to &#8220;Make Everybody Happy!  Buy Your 2nd TV NOW!&#8221;</p>
<p>It is unclear when Don Massa began and ended his time as an electronics salesman, but according to a 1940 Census, he sold electronics in 1940, he was selling them in 1953 when this advertisement ran, and it&#8217;s possible he sold them until he passed away in 1985.  His store was located at 3817 N. Illinois, which is listed as a business location, however, GoogleMaps shows little more than a vacant lot.</p>
<p>The history of Zenith, the television brand advertised here, is a little clearer.  Zenith was founded in Chicago as a radio manufacturer, and made its first black and white television in 1948, just five years before this ad.  In 1954, Zenith introduced the first television with a three-electron-gun rectangular color picture tube (the black and white model only had one electron gun).  In 1955, Zenith introduced the first remote control called the &#8220;Flash-o-matic.&#8221;  Zenith products can still be found today, though the company was sold to LG in the early 2000&#8242;s.</p>

<p><em>Dear Katherine,</em></p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you. It was difficult to track you down. In fact, it was practically impossible. The directories listed you as “Catherine”—with a ‘C’—so I can only assume that this is you. … This is you, right? The Katherine at the corner of Brookside and Olney? The brick building across from the park? The one that’s all … well … the one that’s all … um, let me just back up.</p>
<p>I write articles, you see. Features that talk about historic buildings. Buildings in need of rehabilitation, funding and love. Sometimes the buildings are residential homes. Sometimes they’re grander constructions, such as the Rivoli Theatre. And sometimes they’re commercial properties, such as the old post office in Irvington. Some of the buildings are without roofs, windows or doors. Sometimes they so far vandalized that one is physically unable to recognize the inside, the original woodwork. Sometimes they’re just left to rot by their owners, who are dissatisfied with historic preservation committees. (Or who are against taxes, for that matter.) My little heart breaks when I see plywood covering a home, any home. But despite my discouragement, despite the fact that my spirit aches with each new article, I still have a piece of my heart for you, Katherine.</p>
<p>Because I care about you. And because I care about your past.</p>
<div id="attachment_28119" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Picture-093.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-28119" alt="(photo by Dawn Olsen)" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Picture-093.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(photo by Dawn Olsen)</p></div>
<p>That said, I don’t know much about your beginnings. Is there anything you can tell me? You weren’t present on any of the Sanborn or Baist Maps. It was odd, and I was stumped. Furthermore, your records—your parcel information—doesn’t even list the year of your construction. Do you know when you were built? My guess is that it was in the 1920s. At the time, I had only two city directories at my disposal—one from 1920, and one from 1930. You were absent from the former, included in the latter. “3501 Brookside Parkway,” it said. “Mrs. Florence Hearn, confr.” I also saw that there were six apartments, two with the address of “3501 ½” and four with “3507 ½.” Is this correct? I had heard that Mrs. Florence Hearn, the confectioner, had lived in one of the units. Do you remember any of your first residents?</p>
<p>I obviously don’t remember them, but I did look them up. Warner Roberts was another one of your residents, and I saw his name in the 1940 directory. I think he had a restaurant on the first floor, with the entrance being the corner door on the northwest side of the building. Roberts, I guess, lived in one the apartments. He was not the first—or the last—person to both live and work with you, Katherine. For example, in the 1960s, there was Howard Jenkins, who owned a gun shop on the first floor and lived in 3507 ½, above his shop.</p>
<div id="attachment_28122" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Picture-145.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-28122" alt="(photo by Dawn Olsen)" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Picture-145.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(photo by Dawn Olsen)</p></div>
<p>You’ve been so much more than a gun shop and a restaurant and a confectionary, though, Katherine. So much more. You had novelties. Pharmaceuticals. And in 1980, you were a flower shop, a food store and an insurance office. You were a barber shop, too. Actually, for decades and decades, your middle storefront was a barber shop. (Did it ever have a barber’s pole? You know, one of those helixes of red and blue and white, like what Red’s Classic Barber Shop has? Just spinning and spinning and spinning and telling everyone—passerby, those on the street, those in the park—that there was a trade?) Just tell me what it was like, Katherine. Please. Do you remember?</p>
<p>Do you remember—before rocks were thrown through your windows—what the displays looked like? Fresh flowers or discount advertisements or new models or products? Do you remember the apartments—before the upstairs windows were torn out, before the ivy crept into them and grew on the ceilings? How were they decorated? Rugs? Wood floors? Carpet? White walls? Pictures of family members on the walls? A vanity on the north wall, a dresser on the west? I want to know. I need to know. I need to know, before your walls rip themselves from your foundation, before you crumble to the ground.</p>

<p>You’re in so many pieces, Katherine. What happened? Who did this to you? Why have they left you, abandoned you, torn you and beaten you and discarded you? You’re not disposable, Katherine. Stop telling yourself you are. I know there are people out there would prefer to see you torn down, to prefer you be made into a vacant lot. “It just invites vandals and thugs and criminals,” they say. “It’s good for nothing.” But if they could’ve seen you then, Katherine, ooooohh, they’d disagree. Providing the community with goods? With services? Offering small business owners a place to live and work and develop connections and friendships in the city?</p>
<p>I can do nothing but shake my head.</p>
<p>Because a vacant lot, one overgrown with weeds and trash, doesn’t provide opportunities, either.</p>
<div id="attachment_28118" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Picture-085.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-28118" alt="(photo by Dawn Olsen)" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Picture-085.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(photo by Dawn Olsen)</p></div>
<p>So I guess the real reason I wrote this letter was to ask you a question: what do you want me to do for you, Katherine? What is it that you want? What can I do to help you? And I’ll even just listen to your story, if that’s all you want, because I think you’ve been unheard and ignored for so long.</p>
<p>I look forward to your response,</p>
<p><em>Dawn</em></p>

<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1880-State-Fair-Poster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29002" alt="1880 State Fair Poster" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1880-State-Fair-Poster.jpg" width="462" height="573" /></a>Nathaniel Kemp was a prominent farmer and county commissioner when he traveled to Indianapolis in 1856 and took First Prize for the Best Bushel of Wheat at the Indiana State Fair. The premium was a silver loving cup, which Kemp had proudly engraved with his name when he returned home to Winchester.</p>
<p>By the 1880s, however, Kemp had fallen on hard times.  The once-affluent farmer had lost his health, his wealth and most of his personal property.  His first wife had died, and an ill-advised second marriage had ended in divorce.  According to an 1882 history of Randolph County, &#8220;<i>Mr. Kemp is now in feeble health &#8230;and he now finds himself in his old age a poor man.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Despite his dwindling fortune, Kemp refused to sell his State Fair prize for the value of the silver. It was passed down to his grandchildren, who carefully tucked a note inside the cup explaining the cup&#8217;s significance to their family.  Then they sold it.</p>
<div id="attachment_28982" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/kemp3.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-28982" alt="kemp3" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/kemp3-610x729.jpg" width="610" height="729" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Over the past century, Nathaniel Kemp&#8217;s most cherished possession has changed hands an unknown number of times. Its current caretaker is collector David Yount.</p></div>
<p>The late billionaire Malcolm Forbes had a collection of similar discarded trophies.  He dubbed his collection, &#8220;The Mortality of Immortality,&#8221;  because he was fascinated by how each trophy represented a highlight of someone&#8217;s life, yet was discarded or sold after the winner died.  Unfortunately, such was the fate of Forbes&#8217; own collection of other people&#8217;s trophies.  It was sold at auction in 2011 for more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s unlikely that Forbes owned the silver cup that Gatling gun inventor R.J. Gatling won at the 1855 Indiana State Fair for his essay on &#8220;ditching and draining,&#8221; or the silver tea spoons that Miss Alice Williams took back to Muncie for her prize-winnng &#8220;tippets,&#8221; silver premiums from the State Fair are highly sought after by collectors and would not have been out of place in Forbes&#8217; collection.</p>
<div id="attachment_29004" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sites.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-29004" alt="Sites" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Sites-610x733.jpg" width="610" height="733" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pictured above is the site plan for the first State Fair, held in Military Park. The image shown at the bottom is from the back of an envelope promoting the new Exposition Building. The empty envelope recently sold on eBay for $28.</p></div>
<p>Indiana&#8217;s first state fair was held in October 1852 on the grounds of Military Park. There were 15,000 visitors the first day, 25,000 on the second, and by the third day the fair crowds had overflowed to every corner of the city where a wide variety of sideshows were providing entertainment. Farmers from Indiana and Kentucky flocked to the fair to show their stock and marvel at the latest advances in farm machinery, while women were awestruck by a wonderful invention that would free up hours in their day &#8211; the Singer sewing machine.</p>
<p>Other cities clamored for their fair share of the State Fair&#8217;s bounty, so the event was moved to Lafayette in 1853 and Madison in 1854.  Both proved to be a financial flop, so the State Fair returned to Indianapolis in 1855.</p>
<p>By 1860, the State Fair had outgrown Military Park, so the managers purchased 36 acres north of the city in an area known as the Otis Grove. As the Civil War heated up, however, the site of the fair&#8217;s festivities was turned into Camp Morton, a military prison for Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>After the war ended, the State Fair returned with new vigor to the Camp Morton site. As the State Fair gained in popularity as a tourist attraction, the State Board of Agriculture hired architect <a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/indianapolis-collected-theres-no-place-like-dome/">Edwin May (who later designed the Statehouse)</a> to design an enormous Exposition Building that opened in 1873 on the corner of 19<sup>th</sup> and Alabama Streets.  In addition to serving as a showcase for agriculture and technology, the 1873 Exposition also featured museum-type exhibits of giant tortoise shells and dinosaur skeletons.</p>
<div id="attachment_29008" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 620px"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bones.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-29008 " alt="Bones" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bones-610x941.jpg" width="610" height="941" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These stereographs of the 1873 fossil exhibits were snatched up collectors a few years ago when they were offered on eBay</p></div>
<p>The State Fair also served as sort of an early home show, featuring the latest trends in home decoration, flower arrangement, and gardens. A group of stereoviews from the 1873 garden exhibit recently sold on eBay. Prices ranged from $19 to $52 per card.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Garden.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29007" alt="Garden" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Garden-610x624.jpg" width="610" height="624" /></a>Since its inception in 1852, premiums have been a critical component of the Indiana State Fair, which was established to help encourage improvements in agriculture, stock production and farm machinery through the award of prizes. By 1855, the categories had expanded to include furniture-making, paintings and drawings, as well as &#8220;useful and ornamental&#8221; items such as chair tidies, ottoman covers and toilet cushions. Prizes ranged from coin silver pitchers to paper diplomas, with silver cups awarded as the highest prize in most categories.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1929-art.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-28988" alt="1929 art" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1929-art-610x809.jpg" width="488" height="647" /></a>Although engraved premiums help preserve a winner&#8217;s place in history, the mere fact that an item has been displayed at the State Fair often preserves it for posterity. As shown above, June Woodworth won a 2nd Premium with her cover art for the 1929 Christmas issue of the Echo, the daily newspaper for Shortridge High School.  E. J. Mousley exhibited his pencil drawing of a Second Empire house at the 1937 State Fair.  Mousley lived at 2921 N. Pennsylvania, but it&#8217;s likely that the long-gone house in the drawing was located south of 16th Street. Both Woodworth&#8217;s painting and Mousley&#8217;s sketch are interesting pieces of Indianapolis&#8217; past that may not have survived but for their State Fair connection.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1937-sketch.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28987" alt="1937 sketch" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/1937-sketch-610x350.jpg" width="610" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>Winners will often go to great lengths to preserve their prize-winning item.  Indianapolis attorney John Keeler currently has this giant ear of corn in safekeeping for his children, who inherited it through their maternal grandparents.  Although no one in the family can recall the exact year when the corn was exhibited at the State Fair, its custom-made glass display case has protected it from the perils that typically befall extremely large vegetables and has ensured its survival for future generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Giant-corn.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28990" alt="Giant corn" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Giant-corn-610x348.jpg" width="610" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>Posters are one of the most elusive State Fair collectibles.  Too large to be saved in a scrapbook and too flimsy to survive without framing, most State Fair posters ended up in the trash when the event concluded.  David Yount had searched unsuccessfully for a number of years until the posters shown in this article surfaced at an auction in 2011.  Although a couple of the posters have staining and paper loss, they&#8217;re still prized because of their rarity.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Posters.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29003" alt="Posters" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Posters-610x406.jpg" width="610" height="406" /></a>Thanks to their small size, State Fair ribbons were more likely to survive the years, tucked away with other easily stored mementos. The ribbon on the far left is from the second State Fair, which was held in Lafayette in 1853. The 1856 ribbon would have been worn by a member of the State Agricultural Society, and the 1878 ribbon by a member of the press.  Ribbons for the State Fair and other events can sometimes be found in old books because they made convenient bookmarks.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/State-Fair-ribbons3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28991" alt="State Fair ribbons3" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/State-Fair-ribbons3-610x392.jpg" width="610" height="392" /></a>State Fair tokens featuring the Exposition Building were produced during the years when the event was held in Herron-Morton. Tiffany Benedict-Berkson has assembled a small collection of these tokens, a couple of which had been drilled by former owners for use as a charm.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tokens.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28993" alt="tokens" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tokens-610x545.jpg" width="610" height="545" /></a>Souvenirs were also available for purchase at the State Fair. A fairgoer in the 1920s or &#8217;30s would likely have paid a fraction of the $20 I paid when I found this pennant at an antique mall in Salem in 2011.  Although I do not collect State Fair items, the pennant is a fun addition to my collection of Statehouse images.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/State-Fair-pennant.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28992" alt="State Fair pennant" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/State-Fair-pennant-610x217.jpg" width="610" height="217" /></a>There’s no doubt, however, that the hottest ticket in State Fair collectibles is a ticket to the Beatles concert in 1964. The Fab Four held two shows in Indianapolis. Although ticket stubs crop up from time to time, David Yount has managed to track down some of the really scarce items, such as the invitation to the Beatles&#8217; press conference.</p>
<p><a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Beatles-misc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-29009" alt="Beatles misc" src="http://historicindianapolis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Beatles-misc-610x821.jpg" width="610" height="821" /></a>State Fair collectibles are fascinating because they are as varied and diverse as the people who have participated in the 162-year-old Indiana tradition. Whether it&#8217;s an ear of corn raised during the Depression on an Indiana farm or a note on a ticket stub reminiscing about the night an Indiana teenager was mistaken for Ringo Starr,  there&#8217;s a State Fair souvenir for every Hoosier. <a title="State Fair song" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSKa29E4T7o">Or as Pat Boone sung in 1962</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Our State Fair is a great state fair</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Don&#8217;t miss it don&#8217;t even be late&#8230;</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Alice Ashby Roettger</strong> has been a Broad Rippler since learning to walk and talk, and is still an active member of her beloved neighborhood. A self-taught historian and a writer, Alice could tell you anything and everything about dozens of Broad Ripple bungalows, St. Paul&#8217;s Episcopal Church, or even Bacon Swamp (named after <a href="http://http://historicindianapolis.com/indianapolis-collected-connected-six-degrees-of-hiram-bacon/" target="_blank">Hiram Bacon</a>) that once graced old Indianapolis with its soggy stench.</p>

<p>Alice’s Broad Ripple of the  1930s and 40s was much different from the lively and eccentric Broad Ripple of today. Nearly everything north of Broad Ripple Avenue was prairie and cornfields, and most of the homes weren&#8217;t built until after WWII because of the inability to conquer the swampy underground with pre-war technology.</p>
<p>“The joke was that if you built your house in the Bacon Swamp area, it would be gone by the weekend because of the swampy ground,” said Alice.</p>
<p>But life in the Broad Ripple area was peaceful and safe, and Alice&#8217;s every memory of the place is lined with fondness. Her first home was a double at 6040 College Avenue, with Broadway Park as her backyard. Alice&#8217;s family briefly lived at 5401 Winthrop, but Alice most remembers her family’s beautiful home of 18 years, 6045 Primrose Avenue.</p>

<p>“Growing up in Broad Ripple was like getting back into the pages of the First Grade Reader,” remembered Alice. “It was a self-contained community, where the kids could wander. We had the ‘Dick and Jane’ firehouse, grade school, high school, and movie theatre. But yet, we could hop on a streetcar and have all the big-city things downtown. It was a wonderful place to grow up because we just wandered.”</p>
<p>Although Broad Ripple was a self-sufficient town, Alice would often make the bus trip downtown to shop with her mother or visit her father, who worked in the Security Trust Co. building as a payroll auditor for insurance company Bituminous Casualty, located at 130 East Washington Street. The first word that came to Alice’s mind when describing old downtown Indy was &#8220;dirty.&#8221; The combination of heavy exhaust fumes and heat provided by Indiana Coal created a filthy and gray downtown, something Alice definitely doesn&#8217;t miss about downtown.</p>

<p>Alice walked nearly a mile to School #80 at 62nd Street and Guilford Avenue, then walked home for lunch with a gang of neighborhood kids. Once a week, her class lined up in twos and marched to the City Library in Mustard Hall. School #80 brought an interesting socio-economic cross-section at the time: the wealthy kids from Forest Hills, the Broad Ripplers, and the blue collar farmer kids from north of the canal. Like any child, Alice didn&#8217;t recognize these differences until she was older, but the dynamic created problems every once in a while.</p>

<p>Alice grew up a child of the Second World War, believing that rationing and scrap piles were simply the way things worked. Her family was active in the war effort &#8212; her parents were involved in the American Legion on 64th and College Avenue, and her brother was wounded as a glider pilot. Alice helped her mother in war relief by selling Veteran’s poppies made of paper for two cents each at the corner of 56<sup>th</sup> and Illinois Streets. Another popular war effort was paper stations put on by the schools.</p>
<p>“People all through the school district would open up their garages, and the kids would collect newspapers and magazines,” explained Alice. “There was a contest to see who sold the heaviest weight, and then the money would go to the school PTA. We’d sit on top of the piles of paper and hang out, hoping someone would bring in something dirty so we could read it,” she laughed.</p>

<p>Being a tomboy, Alice loved to play army in the empty lots by their Primrose house, crawling on her belly in a dress because her mother would rarely let her wear pants.</p>
<p>“They had begun building houses in those empty lots and had dug holes for the basements, but the War stopped the process, so they just left the dirt piles. So we’d play in those holes, slide down them on our sleds, have mudball fights. Those were wonderful places to play.”</p>

<p>Alice and her friends went to The Vogue Theatre at least once a week to watch war movies like &#8220;The Immortal Sargent,&#8221; paying 25 cents for a ticket and popcorn.</p>

<p>Alice’s freshman year of high school, Broad Ripple High won the state football championship in front of 10,000 fans at the first lighted football field in the city. The lights had been donated by the Hornbeck family, owners of Little America, in honor of their son who had been killed in the War.</p>

<p>Sub-deb clubs (the 1950s high school version of college Greek life) were highly popular at Broad Ripple high school, complete with rush parties and matching outfits. In fact, Broad Ripple’s own Joan Geisendorff was featured on the cover of LIFE magazine in an article about Indiana sub-debs. But Alice never cared to get involved in them. Instead, she kept busy playing violin in the orchestra and acting in BRHS theatre productions – including playing Pitti-Sing in Broad Ripple’s production of <i>Mikado</i>.</p>

<p>Like most 50s teens, Alice hung out at the drive-in restaurants, including Knobby’s on 38<sup>th</sup> then 52<sup>nd</sup> and Keystone, the North Pole at Westfield and Illinois, and <a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/indianapolis-then-and-now-northwood-drive-in-9075-n-meridian-street/" target="_blank">Northwood</a>, which were both known for serving their hamburgers on toast.</p>

<p>Alice lost both parents at a fairly young age, which left high school and college to be a difficult time in her life. She went to Butler University and graduated with a degree in English. After college, she met, dated, and married her husband, Dick, despite having run through the same halls of School #80. Alice and Dick’s dating relationship coincided with the passing of Alice’s mother, which made for a bittersweet time in their lives. They were blessed with four daughters, despite Alice’s initial desire to have all boys.</p>
<p>“I wanted baby boys – their names are Anne, Ruthie, Sally and Susan!” she chuckled.</p>
<p>They moved into a home in the Broad Ripple area the day before President Kennedy&#8217;s assassination and have been there ever since. Dick was an architect for Wright, Portis, and Lowe (originally downtown at 15<sup>th</sup> and Central), then Odle McGuire Shook (currently located at 429 N. Pennsylvania) and was involved in building the City County Building and the Indianapolis Museum of Art.</p>
<p>While the girls were still at home, Alice mainly did volunteer work, but also worked at Indy Book Nook, a used paperback bookstore on 65<sup>th</sup> and Keystone and at Murder &amp; Mayhem, a mystery bookstore in old Broad Ripple. She sang in the St. Paul’s choir for 25 years, and published a book about the history of St. Paul&#8217;s Church.</p>

<p>Today, Broad Ripple is infamous for its bar scene, but Alice believes they’re doing well with working to create a balance.</p>
<p>“You have the daytime Broad Ripple, and then you have the nighttime Broad Ripple,” she explained. “I don’t mind bars, but I think it’s a little heavy. But I love it. It’s lively, it’s quirky, it’s saved all of the surrounding neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Overall, Alice believes today’s Indianapolis is better than old Indianapolis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Downtown is vibrant and the buildings are clean,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps there’s an overemphasis on sports, and we tend to neglect our arts, but it&#8217;s a wonderful city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Alice keeps plenty busy with seven grandchildren and with freelance writing and editing for various local publications.</p>

<div>The earliest record of formal Christian worship in the Nora area is found in the Minutes Book of the Allisonville Circuit of the Methodist Episcopal Church  of 1827. Meetings were held in the Pursel Log School Building, located near 86th Street and Manderley Drive. However, the first Union Chapel was erected in 1864 on the site of the 1822 Whitinger Burial Ground, situated on a bluff overlooking the White River. That origin structure was used by Quaker, Lutheran, Methodist Episcopal and other Christian denominations. It was the Whitinger deed that stipulated all denominations could use the building &#8212; and thus the name Union Chapel. The <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=8306+Union+Chapel+Road,+Indianapolis,+IN&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x886b52b7a75a64c1:0x8fdd9b62a4ef570,8306+Union+Chapel+Rd,+Indianapolis,+IN+46240&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=v3cEUoDBMcnayAGj6oHQBw&amp;ved=0CCoQ8gEwAA">Union Chapel United Methodist Church</a> that stands near the cemetery today was built in response to the growing suburban population of the 1950&#8242;s. The congregation purchased a five acre tract at the northwest corner of East 86th Street and Haverstick Road and the current building was erected in 1954.</div>

<p>Back in 1836, an association was formed to manage the cemetery in 1901, the association was incorporated and in 2003, it was given the designation of &#8220;Indiana Historic Cemetery&#8221; by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. The cemetery is now governed by a 12-member board of directors &#8212; many of whom have multiple generations of family members buried on the property.</p>

<p>Had you visited the Indiana State Fair between 1920 and 1932, not only would you have seen the usual judging of livestock, you could have also viewed the scientific judging of babies in the &#8220;Better Babies Contest.&#8221;  This very popular event, and the ongoing work of the Indiana State Board of Health&#8217;s Division of Infant and Child Hygiene, helped achieve a major accomplishment by lowering the state&#8217;s infant mortality by one third during the 1920s. However, the roots of the whites-only contests were closely associated with the eugenics movement and Department of Health correspondence containing phrases such as &#8220;race betterment,&#8221; &#8220;feeble-minded,&#8221; and “You can not make a silk purse out of a sow&#8217;s ear, neither can we make a citizen out of an idiot or any person who is not well born” are shocking to today&#8217;s sensibilities.</p>
<p>The baby contests started at the Iowa State Fair in 1911 when a clubwoman asked &#8220;You are raising better cattle, better horses, and better hogs, why don&#8217;t you raise better babies?” In 1920, the Indiana State Board of Health inaugurated the event at the Indiana State Fair. Parents entered 78 babies the first year, but over the next decade the event became so popular that organizers had to cap the entries at 1,200 babies.</p>

<p>Not just looking for pretty babies, a slew of physicians, optometrists, psychologists, and otolaryngologists (head and neck specialists) scored the toddlers in a range of physical and mental tests. All scores were kept high as to not offend the adoring mama and cash prizes were donated by businesses such as milk companies hoping to promote their products. One parent recalled that the $8 prize with comments such as &#8220;knock-knees, poor posture, distended abdomen, and bad temper&#8221; made the parents madder than the $8 made them glad!</p>

<p>The contest was such as hit with Hoosiers that two buildings were constructed in the 1920s to house the contest and displays.

<dt>Since the 1960s the old Better Babies Building has housed the Hook&#8217;s Historic Drug Store and Pharmacy Museum (recently renamed the <a href="http://hooksmuseum.org" target="_blank">Hook&#8217;s Drug Store and Soda Fountain</a>). Hook&#8217;s Drug Store began with one store in Fountain Square in 1900 and grew until the 1980s when acquired by another company. In 1966, the company gave Hook’s Historical Drug Store and Pharmacy Museum as a gift to the people of Indiana to commemorate the state’s sesquicentennial. </dt>

Much of the old drug store display came from an 1849 pharmacy owned by the Grigsby family in Cambridge City. The building is currently owned by the Greenfield Museum Initiative and can be viewed during the State Fair, on special weekends, and rented for parties.</dt>
