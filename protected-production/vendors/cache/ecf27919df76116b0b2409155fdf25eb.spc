<p>As part of my volunteer work with the Green Line citizen&#8217;s advisory committee, I recently attended a meeting which provided updates regarding the study efforts for not only the Green Line, but also the Red Line and Blue Line. By now, if you are one of the many Central Indiana residents following these studies closely, you have seen the latest updates regarding refined routes, potential station locations and the like. I will provide a brief overview of those details here, but I want to spend more time analyzing the finer details of each rapid transit line.</p>
<p>Regular readers will be familiar with Urban Indy&#8217;s position on all of these lines as we have dissected and provided input about what we, as an urban focused group, think about the potential for rapid transit through the Indianapolis region and how striking the proper balance between moving people and revitalizing neighborhoods along the way is critical.</p>
<p>At this point in time, it is valid to offer a fresh analysis of the updated details, the potential station locations and whether or not they serve the areas most in need of the benefits that rapid transit offer.</p>
<p><strong>Blue Line</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_4122" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blue_line_8_2013.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4122" alt="Blue Line Map" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blue_line_8_2013-500x319.jpg" width="500" height="319" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blue Line Map</p></div>
<p>There are no surprises with the Blue Line. Prior coverage has always leaned towards Washington Street being the optimum corridor and while planners have examined trips using 10th street, and the Michigan &amp; New York Street couplet, Washington ultimately ended up on the top of the pile. To that end, <a href="http://indyconnect.org/pages/Public-Meeting-Materials/" target="_blank">this round of refinements</a> (click to open Indy Connect page with maps) offered many station locations. For the most part, they are all logical and really do not offer much room for argument.</p>
<div id="attachment_4123" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blue_line_eastside_inside_465.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4123" alt="Blue Line - East Side inside 465" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blue_line_eastside_inside_465-500x317.jpg" width="500" height="317" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blue Line &#8211; East Side inside 465</p></div>
<p>As you can see from the provided graphics, walk-shed (1/4 mile circles around the stations)  is indicated and for the most part, cover the areas that most of us would think need to be served. The east side receives the lion share of stations along the entire length which makes sense based on existing trip data from IndyGo&#8217;s 8. Inside of 465, where a classic street grid exists, stations are spaced nearly 1/2 mile apart providing a walkable environment for nearly all stations. Outside of 465, stations are spaced further apart and this makes sense. If you have ever traveled this corridor, you know that once outside of 465, Washington Street becomes much wider to accommodate automobiles and the associated commercial land use designs. However, this portion of Washington Street is not without transit trip generators as Washington Square Mall and Meijer both possess significant gravity and are some of the major destinations current transit users travel to. Planners included a rendering of the Irvington Area highlighting what a potential stop could look like. While station design was not a specific focus in planning to this point for the Blue Line. I think most would agree that the rendering paints a pretty picture of the potential station area activity that rapid transit could bring to this already thriving area.</p>
<div id="attachment_4119" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blue_line_detail.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4119 " alt="Blue Line Details" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/blue_line_detail-500x391.jpg" width="400" height="313" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blue Line Details</p></div>
<p>As you can see from the plans, the west side also has a number of stations however, they are spaced further apart. The current land uses, much more industrialized, contribute less to the overall success of the IndyGo 8 and the Blue Line planning reflects that. Although station designs would be similar, planners say an operating plan may provide less frequent service. However, those are merely talking points. The maps provided highlight the original plans taking the Blue Line all the way to the airport providing a high quality transit service for travelers.</p>
<p>One topic we have covered prior was comparative run time improvements versus the current IndyGo 8. Although printed material does not state it as such, the Blue Line could cover the distance from Meijer on the east side, to the downtown transit center, in approximately 30 minutes knocking a substantial amount of time off of what is today, a scheduled 45 minute trip. This is accomplished in most part via the drastically reduced number of stops. However, additional plans call for que jumping at stop lights to give buses some extra time to get in front of automobiles; think Delaware Street downtown at Washington Street.</p>
<p><strong>Green Line</strong></p>
<p>No significant changes were provided that we do not already know about when it comes to the Green Line. The downtown Indy alignments were reviewed and a better defined range of stations along the line were provided with a notable exception being a slight change to the potential Noblesville station. While final station locations have not been determined, planning continues towards the completion of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), required for a federally funded project of this scope, for the Green Line.</p>
<p>At the meeting, significant debate centered on the stations south of Fall Creek and this is valid since there is likely to be only 1 station, at the most 2, in this area. Most community redevelopment professionals would lobby for 2 stations as the resulting impact on the the neighborhood could be a game changer. Long plagued by brownfields and enjoying a small surge of rebound, this area could turn the corner with a pair of rail stations. However, the future remains cloudy for exactly where they may be and we will continue to keep an eye on this as the study moves forward.</p>
<p><strong>Red Line</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_4116" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 243px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/meridian_transit_way.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4116" alt="Red Line - Meridian St Transit Way" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/meridian_transit_way-233x500.jpg" width="233" height="500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Red Line &#8211; Meridian St Transit Way</p></div>
<p>The most exciting news, in my opinion, came out of the Red Line camp. Perhaps some of my excitement is based upon how many possible route options we had leading up to this point in the study. No major changes in the areas were presented. The line is still planned to travel from Carmel to Greenwood via Midtown and Downtown Indy with many stops along the way.</p>
<p>On the north side, there is still some debate on how the line would service the US31 office corridor north of 465. Whether this uses 31 itself, or a combination of College and Pennsylvania to the east remains to be ironed out. However, both would converge on the Carmel City Center. Further south, the line would travel through Broad Ripple with a stop near the new parking garage. Renderings for a potential station were provided and they seem to be contextually sensitive to the area, as you can see by the urban based massing of the station, near where the new parking structure is located.   One plan offered for handling the buses on College Avenue included a phased parking plan that would operate something like this. In the mornings, parking would be restricted for south bound curb lanes during rush hour providing buses a dedicated space to speed along the route. In the afternoon, north bound curb side parking lanes would be similarly reduced. Whether the entire College Ave corridor would be setup this way, or just signaled crossing areas is still cloudy, however, I applaud this proposal. While it would create some heart ache among residents, it would go a long way towards providing a service that is attractive based on frequent service, and rapid transit times along the corridor. South of Broad Ripple Village, there would be a few more stops before reaching 38th street, including 54th street, 46th street and one at 38th.</p>
<div id="attachment_4114" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/store_front_red_line_station.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4114 " alt="Red Line - Store Front Station" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/store_front_red_line_station-500x284.jpg" width="350" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Red Line &#8211; Store Front Station</p></div>
<p>This is where the route gets a bit exciting. The study is still underway, and primary study recommended using the Capitol &amp; Illinois 1 way couplets as travel corridors, but recent news indicates that a dedicated transit-way could be a better choice from 38th to 16th street. Indeed, this is one of Indianapolis&#8217; most transit ready corridors with a vast number of professional employment destinations, Ivy Tech, the Children&#8217;s Museum and thousands of apartments and homes just steps away. A preliminary plan for Meridian calls for a dedicated median lane that buses would use to travel north and south. Station orientation is yet to be determined but would most likely be located in the median as well. At 16th street, the transit-way would end, jogging over to Illinois &amp; Capitol where curb-side dedicated lanes would exist. A graphic for this section was provided indicating where jobs were located along this portion of study and the data supports this potential plan.</p>
<div id="attachment_4115" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/basic_red_line_station.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4115 " alt="Red Line - Basic Station Detail" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/basic_red_line_station-500x233.jpg" width="350" height="163" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Red Line &#8211; Basic Station Detail</p></div>
<p>The idea of a dedicated transit-way is exciting not only for the efficient operations that would result from this design, but also how it reinforces transit as the more efficient means of moving people along this corridor.</p>
<p>South of the downtown transit center, the line would likely utilize Virginia Ave to navigate to Fountain Square. Planners are still working on a route which could bring a station closer to Lilly&#8217;s campus but rest assured, it appears that Fountain Square will be the likely path the Red Line travels through. Heading south, the line would use Shelby Ave for points south of here.</p>
<div id="attachment_4117" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 360px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/meridian_transit_way_inset.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4117 " alt="Meridian Street Detail" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/meridian_transit_way_inset-500x328.jpg" width="350" height="230" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Meridian Street Detail</p></div>
<p>One interesting operating scenario in the far south reaches of the Red Line could involve a branching of the line to service medical and job centers. This would cut frequency in half south of where the line branches however, it would still provide a much improved service over what is today, a very lackluster 1 hour frequency service.</p>
<p>Planners provided a station design guide of sorts. You can see from the provided renderings that a Basic station is planned for most areas which would include standard items such as ticket kiosks, covered seated areas and such. However, some areas with expected higher boarding potential would be rewarded with larger stations including wider overhead coverage areas and perhaps other amenities.</p>
<div id="attachment_4121" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Meridian-SKUP1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4121" alt="Meridian Street - Jobs Detail" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Meridian-SKUP1-500x333.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Meridian Street &#8211; Jobs Detail</p></div>
<p><strong>Wrap Up &amp; Other Details</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_4113" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tod_map.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4113 " alt="TOD Potential Map" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tod_map-322x500.jpg" width="225" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">TOD Potential Map</p></div>
<p>One interesting map that was provided at the meeting was a TOD potential map that combined all 3 routes on a map and indicated what station areas provided the best opportunities for TOD or, Transit Oriented Development.  The downside of the plans provided to this point is that for the most part, they are transportation plans only. There is no associated land use plan that goes with it. Doing so could be difficult though, and the MPO has hired other consultants to assist with station area planning for at least the Green Line, that I have seen. Whether or not this level of detail exists for the Red or Blue Line yet is unknown. However, the MPO DOES have a TOD guide on their website indicating recommended development patterns. It will be interesting to see going forward how individual municipalities utilize this sort of information. Rezone Indy could be one avenue that Indianapolis uses to push developers into planning transit supportive uses around stations. Indeed, this would be one of the most significant outcomes of these transit lines outside of the actual movement of people.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Red and Blue Lines serve the areas that we here at Urban Indy have been saying need to be served. The job centers on the north side. The College Avenue corridor. Meridian Street, Fountain Square and the east side Washington Street corridor. If the finer minutia can be negotiated properly to allow rapid transit to function as rapid transit should function, then these lines could be head and shoulders above anything else that Indianapolis has ever seen in terms of public transportation.</p>
<p>As always, Urban Indy will keep you apprised as the study moves forward.</p>

<p>I crossed the muddy St. Mary&#8217;s River on a footbridge near the Old Fort which affords a decent view of the downtown:</p>

<p>While downtown I had to get a photo of 2 of my favorite buildings in the state, the <a href="http://www.allencountycourthouse.org/">Allen County Courthouse</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Bank_Tower">Lincoln Tower</a>:</p>

<p>I ate lunch at a place I&#8217;d never been before, but it is locally famous: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PowersHamburgers">Powers Hamburgers</a>. Fort Wayne has no White Castles, and in fact, I did a Google search for &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=fort+wayne+white+castle+indiana&amp;data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d220001!2d-86.13275!3d39.7797845!3m2!1i1280!2i861!4f13.1">Fort Wayne White Castle</a>&#8220;, and was sent to Powers. I&#8217;ve never actually had White Castle, so I can&#8217;t really compare, but Powers serves up some delicious sliders.</p>

<p>Just south of Powers is the historic <a href="http://www.bakerstreetstation.com/">Baker Street Train Station</a>. I was lucky to get in to take a couple of photos before a wedding was hosted there:</p>

<p>Downtown now hosts a Single A Baseball Team, the Tin Caps. Their new stadium has an attractive entrance on the south side and a mixed-use building along the north side:</p>

<p>It was time to head back north, and I had to check out the <a href="http://www.historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/?bridgebrowser=truss/oldwells/">Wells Street Bridge</a>. Dating from 1884, it&#8217;s another one of those gems that I never really knew about until after I left town:</p>

<p>On the other side of the river, a major discovery was at hand. Fort Wayne had turned an old train depot into a <a href="http://fwoutfitters.com/">bike shop and outfitters store</a>. Geeking out was in store:</p>

<p>Given that it is known as the 3 Rivers City (sorry Pittsburgh), this town has a lot of bridges. Another one to feature are the MLK bridge downtown:</p>

<p>I decided to ride past my late grandma&#8217;s house, which is on a <a href="https://www.google.com/#sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=northwood+boulevard+fort+wayne&amp;oq=northwood+boulevard+fort+wayne&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0i5i30l3j38.2696.7826.0.8289.21.21.0.0.0.10.609.4544.2j10j6j1j1j1.21.0....0...1c.1.23.psy-ab..17.4.654.w5jU00o6XBM&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=aabfeb84bfcc56d1&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=861&amp;bvm=pv.xjs.s.en_US.seW1cfrvSKg.O">tree-lined boulevard</a> of mostly American Foursquare homes.

<p>Finally I headed up past the remarkably stable State Boulevard commercial district towards IPFW. Most of the small businesses along here have been around for at least 50 years:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s plenty more to see in Indiana&#8217;s second city. I hope this was a good primer for those who are less familiar with the city.</p>

<p>Urban Indy has obtained renderings of the revised mixed use development being proposed for the former Shell station (and neighboring apartment buildings) on the north side of the Central Canal in Broad Ripple.</p>
<div id="attachment_4067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell_site_rendering_v2_12.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4067" alt="Shell Site V2.0 (image credit: Broad Ripple Associates LLC)" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell_site_rendering_v2_12-500x243.jpg" width="500" height="243" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shell Site V2.0 (image credit: Broad Ripple Associates LLC)</p></div>
<p>Initial renderings of the project, which we aired in April, resulted in an uproar from residents and business owners of Broad Ripple. Browning Investments, the developer of the now (up to) 100 unit apartment &amp; retail complex, went back to the drawing boards after the initial renderings were released. Public feedback was accepted and considered in these renderings. Retail space has been revised to 32.5k square feet from the previous 35k.</p>
<p>Much ado has been made of the policy side of this proposal from the request of TIF funds for construction to the luring of Whole Foods as the potential tenant of the retail portion. What hasn&#8217;t received a lot of attention are the design merits of the project; which is what we hope to tackle in this post.</p>
<div id="attachment_4064" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell_site_rendering_v2_3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4064" alt="Shell Site V2.0 (image credit: Broad Ripple Associates LLC)" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shell_site_rendering_v2_3-500x239.jpg" width="500" height="239" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shell Site V2.0 (image credit: Broad Ripple Associates LLC)</p></div>
<p>The new renderings still indicate a large massing at the intersection of the Central Canal and College Ave. A diversity of materials appear to be proposed which would suit the context of the corridor which they face. Other major changes in this round of revisions include the addition of more apartment units on the Carrollton Ave side of the development. A large circular open space appears to be a focal point where the tow path crosses the canal. Could this be a place for future programmed events? A somewhat dominating parking structure is still slated for the north side of the site however, the addition of apartments on Carrollton seems to have mitigated the unsightliness of the initial design. Additionally, sidewalks along Carrollton could go a long way towards transforming the street which currently lacks any sidewalks. Also included with the latest renderings is a loose traffic circulating plan indicating where ingress &amp; egress from the structure would occur, a potentially above par IndyGo bus stop and the location of the commercial vehicle loading dock.</p>
<div id="attachment_4059" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/laverock_road.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4059" alt="Laverock Road (image credit: Curt Ailes)" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/laverock_road-500x332.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Laverock Road (image credit: Curt Ailes)</p></div>
<p>Laverock Road would cease to exist if this development moves forward. The new site would abut the Central Canal adding a pedestrian &amp; cycling only environment where a loosely maintained street exists today. The developer, while unable to implement any changes to the canal itself, will maintain a 20&#8242; setback from the slope of the canal where a hard surface will be maintained preserving the connectivity that currently exists on Laverock. Changes to the canal itself must be approved and implemented by Citizen&#8217;s Energy</p>
<p>Perhaps troubling to some is the amount of automobile traffic congestion that could be induced by this new development. College Avenue, already a busy arterial street, could be subject to an increase in resident and commercial user traffic. In addition, Carrollton Ave would become a secondary egress to the parking structure taking with it 64th street, itself a narrow secondary street.</p>

<p>Will these small village oriented streets be able to handle increases in automobile traffic?</p>
<p>According to a draft traffic study obtained by Urban Indy, a traffic signal could be installed at the entrance to the parking structure. Concerns over traffic congestion prompted BRVA to request that the developer undertake a traffic study, which occurred in June. The study suggests that significant alterations to traffic patterns at College &amp; Broad Ripple Ave. and College &amp; 64th St. are not necessary, however, a traffic light could be installed on College at the entrance to the site.</p>
<p>Of course, an alternative exists in the pedestrian and bicycle friendly nature of  Broad Ripple Village. Indeed, this development would lie adjacent to the Central Canal Tow Path and steps from the Monon, both offering easy pedestrian and cyclists access. Furthermore, the IndyGo 17, with stops on Broad Ripple Ave, would be well positioned to deliver customers as would the 18. Possible future<a href="http://indyconnect.org/pages/Red-Rapid-Transit-Line-Study/" target="_blank"> Red Line</a> service could also interface with the development. Hopefully, a robust transit stop materializes with this development since nothing materialized on the property of the new mixed use parking structure just south of here.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, residential density (over 50 units/acre) would see a vast increase with this development taking a step towards making Broad Ripple much more viable as a transit supportive village typology. While the developer has not requested LEED certification, it should be noted that the increased density is itself much more efficient than single family units.  It will be interesting to see how this development could change transit usage patterns and affect people&#8217;s propensity to cycle to the grocery. Perhaps I am biased since this is how a lot of my family&#8217;s grocery shopping is done though. Sadly, another dominating structure solely dedicated to automobile parking will be some of the baggage this development will bring with it, but I suppose it is a trade off that Indianapolis will have to accept for the foreseeable future as robust rapid transit is not yet a reality.</p>

<p>Jamison Hutchins, Bicycle &amp; Pedestrian Coordinator with DPW, sent along this image today showing what to expect north of 22nd street (all the way to 32nd) once work is completed on the bridge over Fall Creek sometime next year.</p>

<p>According to Jamison, there will be some changes to the intersection treatments as well. He sent along an image and had this to say,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;&#8230;note that we switched the majority of the intersections to the shared right turn lanes as opposed to the old configuration that caused a lot of heartburn to riders and drivers.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Although it will be some time before Illinois Street will reopen to automobile traffic, it is nice to see what riders have in store once the street is back to normal operating service.</p>

<p>The upper floors of this building have been largely vacant for at least 40 years, as seen in <a href="http://historicindianapolis.com/then-now-40-e-washington-street/">this article on</a> Historic Indianapolis. I have not yet heard about plans for the top 3 floors, but the rendering on the window shows a 4 floor building. It is possible that the top floor has deteriorated beyond repair. Still, it is good to see some care taken for this rare link to pre-Civil War Indianapolis.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t often take time to write about the environment of the neighborhood in which I live, but a recent experience caused me to put my urbanist hat on to explore the root cause of a difficult street crossing. I was riding my wife&#8217;s bike with our tow behind trailer and 3 year old son riding co-pilot. The time of the day was roughly 6pm and I had a suspicion that getting where we wanted to go might involve some difficulty. Just how much we were going to encounter might have caused me to re-evaluate our route choice if I had to do this over again. Our destination was Canterbury Park, one of my son&#8217;s favorite playgrounds. We set off northbound on our journey and encountered 52nd street where we were forced to wait for nearly 5 minutes before we could cross to the west bound bike lane because of frequent and rapid automobile traffic.</p>
<div id="attachment_4046" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/52nd_street_traffic_area.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4046" alt="52nd St (image credit: Curt Ailes)" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/52nd_street_traffic_area-500x266.jpg" width="500" height="266" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">52nd St (image credit: Curt Ailes)</p></div>
<p>We were not close enough to the Monon to use it as a gateway which would have been ideal. Furthermore, there are no additional signaled crossings or traffic lights for pedestrians along this stretch. When you think about 52nd street between Keystone &amp; College, your first impression might not be that of danger and the need for caution. Indeed, this stretch used to be comprised of 4 lanes for cars before it was put on a lane diet and reduced to 1 lane in each direction, a center turn lane and curb bike lanes. This is a recipe <a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/2011/10/31/46th-street-rebuild-indy-critique/" target="_blank">I have supported</a> in the past in strategizing how we decrease our city&#8217;s automobile lane miles with the goal of creating safer designs for cyclists &amp; pedestrians.</p>
<p>However, while these improvements may have added a measure of safety, crossing the street, especially at rush hour, is still difficult for cyclists &amp; pedestrians. Part of this difficulty lies with the fact that no additional physical traffic calming features were introduced with the lane diet. Features such as bulb-outs or pedestrian striping could have went a long way towards calming traffic speeds.  The speed limit is 35mph but I can attest first hand, that the cars feel like they move much faster than this when standing on the sidewalk attempting to cross. Furthermore, the only traffic lights on this stretch are located at Keystone Avenue and College Avenue, a distance of 1.3 miles, creating a long stretch for motorists to accelerate to and maintain high speeds. The only real features which might cause a motorist to instinctively slow down are a slight chicane just east of the Monon Trail, and the trail itself.</p>
<div id="attachment_398" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/52nd_monon_1_med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-398" alt="52nd &amp; The Monon looking west (image credit: Curt Ailes)" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/52nd_monon_1_med.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">52nd &amp; The Monon looking west (image credit: Curt Ailes)</p></div>
<p>Bottom line, the design of the street is such that automobiles move freely east &amp; west and pedestrians or cyclists attempting to move across have a tremendous barrier preventing them from safely crossing. In hindsight, simply removing auto travel lanes and adding bike lanes has done essentially nothing to encourage walking and leads to segregated neighborhoods as a result.</p>
<p>How does this design affect our neighborhood&#8217;s connectivity? One might simply conclude that the presence of bike lanes helps, but when crossing the street to use them proves to be as big a task as before, what good are they? Additionally, the lack of space between the sidewalk and roadway puts pedestrians very near the fast moving traffic. Who wants to attempt to move their children across this sort of landscape with the ever present threat of cars quickly zipping by?</p>
<p>While the simple fact is that our city lacks the money to properly modify this street to be the pedestrian-friendly arterial that it could be, something should be done with the design to encourage long term confidence in residents and perhaps create an environment that sheperd&#8217;s family growth in this part of town, something that is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>This problem isn&#8217;t unique to 52nd street. 46th street, a similarly designed street just blocks south, is encumbered with the same design. How could neighborhoods take action to increase safety along this stretch?</p>

<p>I stopped by recently to survey the construction and was delighted to see rapid progress being made to extend the trail which currently ends inside of 465. On the outside of the beltway, significant dirt has been moved to make way for the new trail that will snake its way between Fall Creek and the parkway on a narrow sliver of dirt.</p>
<div id="attachment_4040" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fc_trail_ext_n_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4040" alt="Fall Creek Trail Extension (image credit: Curt Ailes)" src="http://www.urbanindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fc_trail_ext_n_1-500x332.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fall Creek Trail Extension (image credit: Curt Ailes)</p></div>
<p>Although I am not certain of the final routing from Skiles Test Park to outside 465, it appears that there is room to route this under 465 and next to the Creek. Indeed, there is a cut through the woods which seems to indicate this is the direction that construction will take.</p>
