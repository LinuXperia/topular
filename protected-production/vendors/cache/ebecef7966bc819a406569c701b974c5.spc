<p>   I stopped using the word "chick," or variations of it, to describe female human beings when I was in college and was castigated by a female classmate who said I had used a sexist term. In a couple of the on-line dictionaries, it is noted the term, "often offensive," is used to describe a young woman. Women---and men---denigrate themselves for profit in our society. That is not a new phenomenon. What seems "new" is when women do so at the same time as they advance views they few as pro-feminism. </p>
<p>    These and other aspects of women in the workplace and the economy will be discussed Saturday. In addition to the guests announced yesterday, Vanessa Echevarria, currently Miss Hispanic Indiana and a recent graduate from IUPUI, will join us at jeanmarie's shop, easter conservation services, 1134 east 54th Street, 11 am to 1 pm.

<p>   Fifty years ago, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was signed into law by that most ardent lover of women---sarcasm---President John F. Kennedy. As he said, the Act was meant to be the end of the "unconscionable practice of paying female employees less wages than male employees for the same job."  That was the age in which "Mad Men" is placed; an age in which white males were expected to have leadership roles. For everyone else, the notion that "any person born in the United States one day could  grow up to become president" was so much bunk. Women, in many places and families, were discouraged from going to college---unless she wanted to be a teacher or a nurse. One misogynistic (and idiot) of our teachers often said women go to college to "receive an Mrs degree."</p>
<p>   Then the feminism movement hit. Women on TV were portrayed in dominant family roles ("Julia," "Good Times,"), women's issues were openly addressed ("All in the Family" and "Maude"), and a woman even could be sung to "have your own cigarette now, baby, you've come a long ways."</p>
<p>   Unfortunately, despite female students' academic test scores, overall and as a general matter, being superior to those of their male counterparts, and despite that 1963 Federal legislation, pay lagged. I know one man whose eight years of ineptitude did little to advance women's rights---Ronald Raygun-zap. </p>
<p>   A recent study by the National Partnership for Women and Families found that women, in 2012, were paid on average 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. "Women and Equal Pay: Wage Gap Still Intact, Study Shows.," Huff Post, 04/09/13.</p>
<p>   A few matters to note. First, the source of the study. At DSR-TKA Nationals, we debated a team from Vanderbilt. Part of the argument related to rights of disposed people. Vandy's debaters said we only quoted "blacks, Indians and other radicals." This is a study by the National Partnership for Women and Families. Please spare me any ad hominem attacks. The folks there analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data. If someone wants to attack the study, do so on the basis of its methodology. Second, one could say the differences have more to do with levels of education and types of jobs sought by women. Er---exactly. Women are equally capable (superior generally), in school, of scores, grades, etc. Most do not "choose" to take a pass on further education. Pressures from family, the expense now posed by a college education, and other factors feed into the mix.</p>
<p>   Then there is the arrival in the work place.</p>
<p>   This Saturday we will stream "live" from jeammarie's shop and eastern conservation services (I spelled those lower case because that is how I received them in an e-mail; if those spellings are inaccurate, blame the Big Kahuna) located at 1134 East 54th Street---basically across the street from Mama Carolla's (and he spelled east 54th street and mama carolla's in lower-case as well). We stream from 11 am to 1 pm.</p>
<p>   Our guests will be:</p>
<p>   Ann Craig-Cinnamon. She is a broadcast professional with thirty years of experience in both radio (WIFE, WNAP, WENS) and television. For most of her career, she served as the host of popular high profile morning radio shows. I believe she was the first major female radio personality on Indy local radio. She also has been a TV anchor/reporter and the News Director of a statewwide radio network.  Ann and her husband John currently are the publishers of an Indianapolis-area magazine and she writes for several other publications.</p>
<p>   Donna Edmond has a Masters in Theater from Georgia State University. She is a co-developer of 3-D Virtual Theater Design software. She is on faculty with the Wheeler Art Center at the University of Indianapolis and in Administration/Management at Ivy Tech-Lafayette.</p>
<p>   Author-illustrator Kimann Schultz resides in Indianapolis with her husband and daughter and also is the mother of two adult sons. She "writes with pictures and draws with words." She graduated from IU with a degree in Art History. She received fashion illustration training in New York City at Parsons and FIT. With that training, and her architectural entourage illustration education she received during her 11 years with an Indianapolis-area firm, she has produced countless bridal and architectural portraits on commission, as well as numerous literary illustrations. A self-described "Pollyanna Polemic," Kimann is the author of a full-length novel, a pop-sociological commentary, numerous short stories, fairy tales and a collection of poems and lyric poetry entitled "Rugs on Puddles, Coats Over Oceans," available on Amazon and at iBooks. Her essay, "Do What You Have to Do," was featured in the 2012 release, "This I believe: On Motherhood."

When a law is challenged on the grounds that it infringes the First Amendment's protections of free speech, and the defendant(s) claim the speech is political, the court must subject the ordinance or law to the strict scrutiny test. The State must establish that it has a compelling interest to advance the ordinance or law. </p>
<p>   In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, the Supreme Court held that "fighting words"---"Inflammatory speech ...[that] might incite a violent response"---are not protected by the First Amendment. Similarly, State and Federal courts have upheld causes of action for defamation---libel and slander---on the grounds that such speech advances no genuine interest plus it harms through its falseness.</p>
<p>   Cyber bullying, it can be argued, in many cases falls within these categories of unprotected speech. Then again, where is the line across which a person crosses? Threat of a specific illegal act against a specific person would seem to fall outside First Amendment protections.</p>
<p>   Governmental regulation of speech, through laws or ordinances that ban or punish certain forms of speech, are subject to the First Amendment. On the other hand, there is no guarantee of free speech on private property. One person, for example, does not have the right to stand in the living room of another person and expound on that first person's views on any subject. If the person does not want such speech expressed in her or his home, then the speaker legally may be forced to leave.</p>
<p>   That is one dilemma in regard to the internet. At what point is the internet "public" and where is it "private"? When you check off the box and agree to the terms of various social networks, you have just agreed to the terms of a licensing agreement. That, again generally, means you have entered the private sphere. That, some argue, is similar to entry into another person's home or business. Where, on the internet, is the purely public sphere? Where is the place analogous to the public square in which a person can place a "soap box" and speak about whatever topic that person wishes without interference from others?</p>
<p>   Political speech is amongst the most protected form of expression under our Federal, and State, Constitutions. Even that speech has been restricted, however, particularly during times of war. In Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919), judgments of conviction were affirmed of individuals who passed out literature against World War I. It could be argued the speech was effective. The test laid down in that case was the "clear and present danger" test. One could argue the "clear and present danger" consisted of the speech having been effective.    </p>
<p>   Limits on the internet pose a threat even more pervasive, as the internet is in our homes.</p>

<p>   The lives of young people---from my perspective these days, that would be anyone under the age of 40, but, on a more general basis I mean people of high school age and younger---in 2013 are dominated by computer-based communications systems. Nearly all communications today could be said to be computer-based. A call from a rotary-dial telephone goes through a computer somewhere, instead of simple wires that lead to the Mayberry switchboard. By computer-based communications, I mean messages on the internet or similar media.  Once source defines "cyberbullying": "Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place using electronic technology. Electronic technology includes devices and equipment such as cell phones, computers, and tablets as well as communication tools including social media sites, text messages, chat, and websites. Examples of cyberbullying include mean text messages or emails, rumors sent by email or posted on social networking sites, and embarrassing pictures, videos, websites, or fake profiles." (stopbullying.gov)</p>
<p>   That same source notes that in 2008-09, six percent (6%) of students in grades 6-12 experienced cyberbullying. (National Center for Education Studies and Bureau of Justice Statistics.)  "The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey finds that 16% of high school students (grades 9-12) were electronically bullied in the past year. Research on cyberbullying is growing. However, because kids' technology use changes rapidly, it is difficult to design surveys that accurately capture trends."</p>
<p>   Also, it is difficult to derive meaningful numbers when a lot of kids are reluctant to tell their parents about cyberbullying or flip out their "tablet" and show their folks some disgusting photoshopped image someone created that fuses the kid's face with a body from an on-line porn flick. Kids presumably are at least as reluctant as we were in the late 1960s and early 1970s to inform our parents of being bullied. If there weren't blood and bruises---over signs of being bullied---there was no reason, necessarily to say anything. The impact was great on some kids back then. Now?</p>
<p>   An analogy was made last evening. A person described 200 or 300 students with computers as comparable to the same 200 or 300 kids cut loose in a high school gym with no supervision.</p>
<p>   There are solutions recommended. The most extreme would be government to monitor kids' communications on the internet. That occurs to some degree, when a student uses a school computer. When a student is on the premises of a school, I think the school, acting in loco parentis, has the authority and responsibility to monitor students---nearly all of whom are minors---in their communications while at school. </p>
<p>   There is a problem, though, when the kids leave school grounds and are on their own electronic "devices." The First Amendment, various other provisions of the United States Constitution that have been construed as creating a right to privacy, and the right to be left alone by government all would indicate the school's authority ends at 3:25 (or whatever time school lets out) and the kids' departure from school property (unless the kids are in a school-related activity like a game or tournament, show, etc.).</p>
<p>   This week we shall stream "live" from Lil Peanut Productions at 735 North Lynhurst to discuss cyberbullying, means by which the problems can be addressed, and the limits of such means---both logistically and constitutionally. Our guests will include Bruce Canal and Susan Canal, owners of Social Net Watcher, and Sergeant John Akers of the Indianapolis Public Schools, Shortridge Middle School.

<p>   When I thought about a title for this blog yesterday, I thought "the time has come to seriously consider..." Then I realized, the time is now.</p>
<p>   I have been a fan of football. I like to watch college and professional games. My Division III alma mater plays our foe each year in the Monon Bell Game, the oldest rivalry west of the Allegheny Mountains. I grew up watching the Chicago Bears each Sunday. The only World Championship of a sports teams, of which I have been a lifelong fan, to occur was the Bears' Super Bowl in 1986. I did not play football, for several reasons. First, I was too little. When 7th grade practices began (the first year of organized play at that time in our area), I weighed 62 pounds. I was not exactly offensive line material. Second, the practices seemed sadistic. Guys would talk about the hell of three-a-day practices in August during which they sucked on salt tablets to conserve water (as opposed to open access to frequent/as needed water breaks). Finally, my mother, was who was registered nurse, thought football was too dangerous. Her veto could have been overridden, but everything considered, I took a pass, as it were, on football.</p>
<p>   Football is a contact sport. That means something more than there "might" be contact on a play, as in basketball, where a foul is to be called on contact, but physical shoves, etc., occur. That means something more than what occurs in baseball, where an occasional "bean ball" is tossed, the pitcher thrown out of the game, and both benches fined for the brawl that ensued the pitch and the batter being struck. In football, on every play, the linemen launch themselves at each other. The quarterback is an obvious target, but so, too, are the running backs and receivers. The defensive players are on the other side of those hits. </p>
<p>   Last year there was a lot of concern expressed about concussions, because several quarterbacks had been put out of games by concussions. Then Junior Seau committed suicide. Other players died from long-term brain injuries.</p>
<p>    3.5 million kids between the ages of six and thirteen play football in this country. "Concussion Study Makes Case for Reducing Contact Drills for Youth Players," New York Times, 7/25/13. Last fall, in a peewee football league game in Southbridge, Massachusetts, three kids were carried off the field with concussions when their team lost in a 52-0 rout. Hitting is encouraged. As one writer has noted, "the tapestry of physical grace and brute strength at the heart of football is the more perfect distillation of our national essence" than baseball.  "On Super Bowl Sunday, Nachos, Beer and Bashed Brains," Huff Post, 2/3/13. A study issued by the Cleveland Clinic followed 67 college football players over the course of the 2011 season. "Although none of the players experienced concussions, blood tests showed that the five players who absorbed the hardest hits had elevated levels of an antibody linked to brain damage."  "New Research Points to Brain Injuries in College Football, "Bloomburg Busibessweek," 3/6/13. The same article points out "evidence of chronic traumatic enceplalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative brain disease that causes dementia and depression, was found in several former pro players, including some who committed suicide. The Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University later found the disease in 34 of 35 former NFL players examined."</p>
<p>   Out of all those millions of kids who play football, only a small percentage will receive offers of college scholarships, the carrot for many of the players. Out of the thousands who play college football, fewer still become players in the NFL. Thirty-two (32) teams times however many are on the roster (56?) for each. And sure, a base NFL salary is in six figures, but an average career only is three years long.</p>
<p>   There is a concept in law called assumption of risk. That means when one is aware of the risks of an activity, and one proceeds to engage in that activity, one is responsible any her or his injuries that may result. The warning signs at a ballpark for "objects leaving the field" is an example of explanation of risks, and the fans sitting in the seats and watching the game is an example of their voluntary assumption of the risk of injury. When people played football in the 1950s and on, they knew they could break a leg or an arm. A kid in my class broke a leg in a game. No one explained about the long-term effects on those kids' brains. Besides, a 12-year-old kid is not old enough to make a decision to assume such a risk. Only recently were we made aware of the long-term risks of increased occurrence of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and other such Central Nervous System (CNS) maladies to football players. No one could assume this risk, of which they were unaware.</p>
<p>   At the same time, colleges rake in a lot of cash through football. Players receive scholarships---and then what? They suffer lifelong debilitation and maybe---maybe---receive a bachelor's degree. The NFL makes billions---that's with a "b"---while their players earn six figure incomes---yeah, some earn a lot more, but the grunt in the trenches is the one who makes room for the salary-cap jockeying for high-profile players.</p>
<p>   Finally, what other country instills in its youth violence at such an early age through encouragement of participation in such a violent game? High school chants of "Blood makes the grass grow!" are not uncommon. This societal violence is not limited to the players (who, more often it seems lately, get into scrapes with the law), but spreads to the fans. Little kids try to emulate their heroes, and replay hard hits. When a society programs violence into its children, it only can expect greater manifestations of violence at later ages of its population. For now, pro players have committed themselves. They can choose. But they should receive a lot of compensation from owners---whose operations we subsidize with taxes.</p>
<p>   We should ban football in schools---junior high (or do they call it "middle school" now?), high school, and college. I am going to find it difficult this year, but I will try to avoid watching da Bears and the Colts. There's always post-season baseball---right. I'm a fan of the Chicago Cubs National League Baseball Club. Well, there's always next year.</p>

<p>   About half of teens have been the victim of cyberbullying. Only ten percent (10%) of those kids tell their parents. The latter should not be a surprise. A kid---male or female, whatever ethnicity, color or religion---especially if the kid is a teenager, does not want to have to go to mom or dad and say, "I'm getting bullied." That was true over 40 years ago (Ah! I'm that old?) when I was a teenager. It is no less true today; maybe more so. When I was in school, the bullying took the form of being shoved into a locker or punched (as I walked out of a classroom by a guy who blind-sided me; he could have looked me in the face and beaten me up, he was that much bigger, but bullies are cowards). </p>
<p>   Today's kids who face cyberbullying are going to do what? Show their parents photo-shopped images of themselves in disgusting sexual positions? Or pull up whatever on their smart phone or laptop or notebook and show page after page of obscenity-laden rants someone has posted about them? </p>
<p>    According to one source, risks of suicide, as a result of cyberbullying, are greater for kids in "middle school" (we called it junior high; "middle school" evokes images of Middle Earth and hobbits.) Kids around the ages of 12 and 13 have a lot of pressure on them---to learn to adapt to a new world at the same time as hormonal changes that accompany puberty.</p>
<p>   About half of kids have been the "bully" in this whole thing. Those numbers overlap with the victims. Part of it has to do with how kids at that age are kids---they don't understand the emotional devastation of their acts. Or, if they do, they have been victims and want to take some of the anger they feel out on others.</p>
<p>   On Saturday's Show we will discuss the problem of cyberbullying. Our guests will include Bruce Canal and Susan Canal, owners of Social Net Watcher, a company that has developed software to thwart cyberbullying. Also, Sergeant John Akers, Indianapolis Public Schools, Shortridge Middle School will be on. We stream "live" from 11 am to 1 pm. Please tune in.</p>

The last "bad" incident had been my junior year of high school, when I was slammed into a locker by two brothers who were jocks. They therefore were immune from most disciplinary measures the school could have taken, since most of the people in the high school responsible for discipline were coaches. Most, if not all, of the bullies I had encountered along the way did not do much with their lives. A couple of them at least ended up in the Department of Correction, and not as guards. I take no joy in that assessment. Various studies indicate that "bullies" usually come from backgrounds in which they have been abused.</p>
<p>   As "real" as the bullying seemed to me, there were kids who had it worse. A couple of them transferred out of school. At least one committed suicide.</p>
<p>   Today, kids have the internet. Suddenly, the environment in which bullies can reign has expanded in space---they now can come right into the home and not be kept out a doors and locks---and time---school ends at 3:25? They can be on-line in the middle of the night. The cruelty is quantitatively different. Perhaps it is qualitatively different as well. On-line photo-shopped images with accompanying slurs distributed to several hundred of one's fellow students probably have greater impact than two brothers who slam a kid into a locker.</p>

The Office of Strategic Services, at the end of World War II, saw great value in the abilities of German scientists who could help the United States. High among U.S. goals: secure the scientists who worked at the Reich's missile research center in Peenemunde.</p>
<p>   There were a few problems with the attainment of this goal. One problem was not the  scientists' desire to join the efforts of the United States ally that closed in from the East---the Soviet Union. German scientists moved West as quickly as they could. Instead, problems arose because of the immediate prior work experience those scientists, and others whom the United States wanted to work on various projects, would have listed on their resumes. Their employer would have been the same---Nazi Germany. There is a common misperception, amongst those in this country who know of the place, about the scientists at Peenemunde. Scientists were in one place and the people who were forced into slave labor were in another. Werhner von Braun and his co-workers knew little or nothing of the people who died in labor on the V-2 rockets, for example. Instead, the scientists knew people died as they labored on the rockets. President Truman had issued an order at the end of the War that restricted from allowing into this country anyone found "to have been a member of the Nazi Party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active participant in Nazi militarism."</p>
<p>   "Operation Paperclip" derived its name from the way in which former Nazis' identities would be paper-clipped to their new identities in the States. This country could allow former Nazis to work here if, officially, they were not former Nazis. Tom Lehrer's song, "I Was Not a Nazi Polka" carries some of the sentiments one might first think about.</p>
<p>   Scientists were not the only recruits. Reinhard Gehlen, who worked in intelligence for the Wehrmacht. The United States military employed him to set up a ring of former SS, SD, and Wehrmacht officers to spy on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>   One questions whether the incorporation in the United States military and intelligence apparati was wise. The Nazi Party was not like the Elks, some sort of weekend gig where people shot golf and drank. Nazis shot people, burned people and bombed people in the name of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>   Dr. Dennis Cuddy has written a book, "The Power Elite and the Secret Nazi Plan," about purported long-range plans by the Nazis to impose a socialist government on the World---two generations after the end of a war they saw they were going to lose. He will be our guest on "Civil Discourse Now" on Saturday, August 3, live-streamed from 11 am to 1 pm. Also Gary Welsh will be a guest panelist. Gary has a great deal of knowledge about the specific programs Dr. Cuddy will discuss. As of this writing, I believe we will live-stream from Papa Roux's at 8950 East 10th Street. I will try to confirm that this morning.   </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   As Germany's army fell in the spring of 1945, then-General Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered German citizens who lived near the death camps to walk through those camps. Eisenhower also brought the press into the camps to ensure no one later would question the monstrous extent of the Nazi government's actions against many groups, most prominently in our history books members of the Hebrew faith, but also Gypsies, gays, and those who had opposed Hitler. The Nuremberg trials of war criminals (that was Herman Goering in the wild shades) fixated the World on the Nazi atrocities. </p>
<p>   So we, Americans innocent of wrongdoing in the lead-up to the War and a people who lost soldiers in combat against the Wehrmacht, won World War II and the Nazis were punished, right?</p>
<p>   Sometimes history is not so simple.</p>
<p>   Hitler was viewed as a joke by some. He was viewed by others, however, as a bulwark against Bolshevism---after all, he hated communists and his brown shirts (S.A.) battled those dirty commies in the streets. Hitler had supporters here in the United States. German industries that supported Hitler and were critical to Hitler's coming war effort received financial support from United States corporations. For example, I.G. Farben, manufacturer of the Zyklon B gas that eventually (after much trial-and-error by Adolf Eichmann's bureaucrats) was used as the "gas" in the "gas chambers" of Auschwitz and other death camps received funds for expansion of its facilities, prior to World War II from National City Bank, J.P. Morgan's Equitable Trust Company, and Harris Forbes &amp; Company.</p>
<p>   Krupp industries manufactured war materiel. After the War ended, Alfried Krupp "was tried before a Nuremberg Military Tribunal and found guilty as a war criminal on July 31, 1948..." This is quoted from Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D., "The Power Elite and the Secret Nazi Plan," part 2. Dr. Cuddy goes on to note "on February 4, 1951 [U.S. High Commissioner in Germany John J.] McCloy issued a general amnesty plus the return of Krupp's personal fortune and corporate property." Krupp had used slave labor in its manufacturing process. Some of the people were worked until they died, then were placed by other who faced a similar fate.</p>
<p>   Werner von Braun was a major in the SS---those guys with the snazzy black uniforms that were good for hiding stains of blood. Braun was brought to the United States and was instrumental in the post-War rocket program in the United States that put people on the Moon. </p>
<p>   On Saturday we shall have, as a guest, Dr. Cuddy, to discuss his book and the role in the United States played before the War in Hitler's rise to power and after the War, in placement of Nazis in places of power. He postulates a power structure, now in place in our World, that was planned by the Nazis. The Show should be interesting.   </p>

The speaker of such words nearly always explained that Hitler's economic and foreign policies had benefited the German people in that those policies brought der Fatherland out of its longtime depression and rid it of the bonds of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>   Hitler was not a "genius." I have seen no standardized intelligence test scores for Hitler. I doubt any were administered to students in Austria, where he was born and raised. Currently I am re-reading William Shirer's "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." I explained to a neighbor the book---on the front cover of which is a rather prominent swastika---is a much-praised history of the events that led up to World War II in Europe, and the war itself. I did not want her to think I planned meetings of a nefarious organization at our home. Shirer goes into some detail about Hitler's academic existence. Except for hand drawing in art, Hitler's grades were mediocre. Grades are not necessarily indicative of one's intelligence.</p>
<p>   So let us go to other indicators of Hitler's lack of intelligence.</p>
<p>   First, let's deal with the two areas in which his "genius" usually is praised. As far as bringing Germany out of its long economic depression, we need to ask---which "depression"? Immediately after World War I, a combination of factors sent Germany into the economic pits. By the mid-1920s, long before Hitler took power, Germany had recovered from that first depression. A second depression was part of a World-wide depression, symbolized by the 1929 crash of the Stock Market in New York. This depression gave Hitler and his minions leverage in the political turmoil that was Germany. However, as Shirer writes:  "What interested Hitler was political power; economics could somehow take care of itself." "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p. 84. "And though the very name of the Nazi Party proclaimed it as 'socialist,' Hitler was even more vague on the kind of 'socialism' he envisaged for the new Germany."  Id. at 85. When Hitler finally gained power, essentially he wrote bad checks to build armaments and infrastructure (e.g., the Autobahn).</p>
<p>   Second, the economic impact of the Treaty of Versailles---primarily payment of war reparations---was onerous to most Germans. In 1931 a moratorium had been placed on such payments. In 1932, a conference was held in Lausanne, Switzerland, at which delegates from Great Britain, France, and Germany agreed  to suspend the reparations payments on July 9. Hitler did not come to power until January 30, 1933.  </p>
<p>   How was Hitler stupid? First, this whole Aryan race thing was silly. He thought of a time when the Aryan race ruled and great things were accomplished. Unfortunately, such a period did not exist. Also, mitochondrial DNA indicates all humans are descended from the same female of our species. Whether he would have liked the news or not, Hitler was a descendant of Africans. His notions of race not only were pish-posh on their surface, they were flawed in the double helix of DNA.</p>
<p>   The last bit I will toss into the mix because it appears on the first page of "Mein Kampf," Hitler's book. On the first page he warns against Germany getting caught in a two-front war. Hitler committed Germany to more than two fronts in World War II. There was the Western Front---France, etc.---the dreaded Eastern Front ("Klin, I will send you to the Eastern Front!"), but also fronts in Northern Africa and Scandinavia. Presumably a "genius" would not pitch the first page of his overall plan (a book written by a short, dark-haired guy) for a master race (of tall, blond-haired guys) and go the opposite direction from what he advised as prudent.</p>
<p>   Dennis L. Cuddy obtained his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina. He is the author of numerous books and published articles. Most recently he has published, "The Power Elite and the Secret Nazi Plan." However much Hitler might have been screwed up, others in the Third Reich set in motion plans that were to be carried out after the War, in the event of German defeat. On Saturday, from 11 am to 1 pm, Dr. Cuddy will discuss his book, those long-range Nazi plans and their contemporaneous effects.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

I had learned that people "tagged" buildings and that while some of the graffiti was art for the sake of art, albeit on the sides of buildings or other structures, the owners of which had were little enthused about what had been spray-painted during the night, much of the graffiti was gang-related. Gangs tagged walls to mark territory.</p>
<p>   The party was in a walled-in backyard just off Lincoln Park. The area was nice. Still, it was the City. Some dumbass from our party of eight or ten had left unlatched the door (really, it was a door) built into the wall. Three kids in their early teens tried the knob, apparently, and sauntered into the party. There was a boom box on a table. I think we had The Beatles on. One of the kids reached over, switched from tape (yes, it was the age of cassettes) and turned to a rap station. The kids continued to talk amongst themselves and ignored our presence. I was pissed off and started to walk over and say something, but one of the other guests was a former bouncer and grabbed my arm. She (yes, "she" had been a bouncer and was not a person with whom I would have messed) whispered, "Don't." We waited for about five or six minutes and, finally, they left. The door was closed as soon as they were out. I should add the top of the wall had broken glass imbedded in it, as a sort of wall above the wall. Concertina wire, in that neighborhood I guess, was a faux pas.</p>
<p>   I related these experiences because the City-County Council has proposed to fine property owners who do not remove graffiti from structures after a complaint has been filed. If the "artists" of the graffiti had executed a mural meant to express some aesthetic understanding of a part of existence, its placement on another person's building would be wrong, but removal would be without retaliation.</p>
<p>   Most of the graffiti in question is of a different type and its removal bears serious consequences. If people remove gang tags, they risk injury or death.</p>
<p>   It is cheaper, however, for the City to require property owners to bear the weight of enforcement of an ordinance like this. Tax monies need to be spent on welfare for billionaire sports owners. We even need cricket on the East side. So if the City can shove responsibility and enforcement onto the citizens, why not?

<p>   Because much of my practice is focused in the areas of appeal and post-conviction relief, I frequently visit clients in correctional facilities in Indiana.</p>
<p>   One point to get out of the way is that if we had better systems of education and aid to the poor, provided jobs that paid meaningful wages to more people, and gave women of lower income more control over what are their reproductive rights, we probably would not need so many correctional facilities, a/k/a prisons. (I know Leon Dixon and Nicolas Martin will want to jump on that sentence.) If drugs were legal, we would need still fewer.</p>
<p>   Given the circumstances, there are prisons in Indiana. The United States, with five percent (5%) of the World's population has twenty-five percent (25%) of its prison population. This is not the "Land of the Free." </p>
<p>   There has been a move in recent years to "privatize" prisons. The notion is the one common to privatization efforts. If we turn prisons over to the private sector, the private sector will run prisons more efficiently and taxpayers will be spared part of the burden of payment for society.</p>
<p>   CCA, Corrections Corporation of America, is one of the Big Three of private correctional corporations. CCA runs a facility in New Castle. A copy of CCA's model contract was obtained by the Libertarian Party in the last election cycle. When CCA enters into a contract with a State, CCA likes to require the State will maintain Ninety Percent (90%) occupancy of a facility or the overall facilities of the State, depending upon the contract.</p>
<p>   The purpose of government is not to ensure private corporations occupancy of penal facilities. With politicians purportedly so focused on government savings, a penalty clause in a contract---e.g., miss that Ninety Percent (90%) occupancy and the State pays the private corporation---would cause them to spaz out. The inclination would be for politicians to pass more laws to make more acts illegal, or to pass laws that make penalties more harsh. As to the latter, sentences would be longer and credit time for inmates would be reduced.</p>
<p>   Politicians far more frequently run on "get tough" platforms when the subject is "law and order" (not to be confused with the TV series franchise). It is difficult for a candidate to run on a platform in which she or he vows to protect the procedural rights of those accused of violation of the law. Politicians frequently run on platforms that vow to save the taxpayers money. The privatization creed goes on that line.</p>
<p>   There are certain functions that never should be privatized. These include police protection, fire protection, and penal custody. In some instances, private correctional corporations "employ" inmates at very low wages and manufacture goods to sell in the marketplace. Those corporations compete with other companies that have to pay higher wages to employees who are not (yet) in prison. This is not an example of a "free" marketplace or equal competition.</p>
<p>   The Indiana Department of Correction is a bureaucracy of the State of Indiana.  As such there are legitimate criticisms of ways in which it operates. The correctional officials with whom I have had contact almost universally have been professional in their approach to their jobs. There should not be a movement to privatize our correctional system.  If anything, we should seek to make illegal any attempt to privatize our penal facilities. Of course, CCA has more dollars with which to lobby than would a force that opposes CCA. So that would be a legislative measure with less hope of passage than the proposal that the number for Pi be "3."</p>

<p>   With the past week's revelations of communications between then-Governor Mitch Daniels and then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett (whom I thought was better either as a singer or as head men's basketball coach at University of Wisconsin), a lot of people have discussed the state of education both in Indiana and in the United States.</p>
<p>   Discussion of public affairs is good, but also can be scary.</p>
<p>  I fear for our educational system because of several elements. First is that reflected by one of the Osmonds who is a member of the Utah state legislature. He has suggested public education be eliminated. A couple of years ago, at a rally at the state House, I made a similar suggestion---but as a joke. One of the factors that led to the United States advancement as a society between the mid-1800s and the late Twentieth Century was universal, compulsory public education. On "Civil Discourse Now" on July 13, one of the panelists suggested this country does not compete well with other countries in the education of our people. That statement was made in the course of a discussion in which it was suggested that the concept of public education was to blame. Presumably, the argument would go, if we bring in more vouchers and privatize schools, we will compete more effectively with those other countries. The #1 school system in the World at present is that of Finland. According to an educational official from Finland who visited the United States, there are no private schools in Finland. The United States model has become a bastardized form in which religion once again has ripped control and seeks to infuse the minds of our young with dogma. As Cardinal Newman once said, give me a boy at the age of five, and he is mine forever.</p>
<p>   Religion has no place in public education. The most obvious reason is the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. We should not spend public monies on catechism of our youth. Faith-based education should be taught, if parents choose, on the particular day of worship of those parents or that parent in the church, tabernacle, mosque, or whatever the appropriate term for the house of worship of the religion in question. One definition of "faith" is "belief which is not based on truth." That is at odds with science and other means by which knowledge is pursued and taught.</p>
<p>   The Osmonds are entitled to teach their children at home (shudder) or at the local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons) of their choice. Mainstream public education in the United States has its faults. To go back in time and allow religion to program our children will mean we shall continue to fall behind other countries.</p>
<p>   Mitch Daniels attended and graduated from Princeton. I am confident Howard Zinn's books were taught in at least a couple of classes there. Perhaps Mitch skipped lecture on those particular days, hungover from an acid trip (he was busted for sale of LSD as an undergrad; for which I do not criticize him except to say, amongst other things, he was a hypocrite to enforce harsh drug laws as Governor). It's tough to concentrate when little squiggly shapes appear in the surface of the chalkboard and sounds others might not hear whisper sweet songs that remind one of the Grateful Dead.  He was bad as a financial adviser to President George W. Bush in the first term (and brought upon us all that debt). He was bad as Governor of Indiana (during which time he put us in the "black," temporarily by peddling  off State capital assets for decades and pennies on the dollar. He helped drive out unions and replaced those jobs with jobs that pay less and provide few bennies. Work at Wal-Mart? Taxpayers subsidize Wal-Mart because many employees earn so little they must seek public assistance.</p>
<p>   The last thing we should do is abandon public education for bastardized models that rely upon religion.

<p>   I said this on The Show and I have written this before, but, I'll say it in a different way. If one employs cost-benefit analysis, one would be hard-pressed to beat the value of the price of admission to the IFF. You will see films you otherwise would not see---almost certainly not in a theater, but equally unlikely on TV. Maybe one could see some (eventually maybe all?) on the internet. But you also would miss the experience of watching a movie with others in a theater, and that is an important element for movies.</p>
<p>   One work is "Wings for Maggie Ray," filmed by Fishers resident Philip Paluso. The story is a real-life account of a Hoosier farm girl from near Fort Wayne who flew aircraft, during WWII as a WASP. Her story, and the story of the women who ferried military aircraft from (usually) points of assembly to points of embarkation for use in the War, are told in a well-shot and written film. </p>
<p>   Another fascinating film is "Open Mic Night After the Apocalypse." Again, a Hoosier filmmaker, Mike James, has shot an amazing full-length documentary about people who live in Slab City, "a decommissioned military base with no running water or electricity" located on "the coast of the doomed Salton Sea" in southern California. As the synopsis in the Festival program notes: "Retirees, vagabonds, and fugitives call it home. The also have another name for it: The Last Free Place in America. Filmmakers set out to make a rock doc in one of the most hostile environments in our country. It's 'Gimme Shelter' meets 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.'" </p>
<p>   "Mushroom Hunter" was directed and produced by Hoosier native and St. John's University English professor William Torgerson. A 30-minute film, it tells the story of people who hunt Morel mushrooms in northern Indiana. If you are a Hoosier, you will know of people---perhaps you are one---who go out in places they keep secret to pick Morels.</p>
<p>   There are a lot more films than these, but these folks were on The Show yesterday. You can go to SoundCloud and catch it, or go to Indiana Talks dot com and pick it up. You also can go to the Festival's website indyfilmfest.ord and check the lineup and show times.</p>

<p>   In 1975 I helped organize students at DePauw to protest the University's denial of tenure to a professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. The denial had the effect of termination of the professor's employment. DePauw, at the time (maybe still) required that a professor achieve tenure within seven years of that professor's employment, or the employment would end. The professor, Robert Fornaro, held a Ph.D., had published peer-review articles, and had been voted Professor of the Year at least twice by students at DPU. After two years of prolonged procedures of appeal, the denial was made final. We had a demonstration at the Union Building, held a one-day moratorium of classes (a sunny, warm spring day as I recall), and then DePauw went on as usual. Apparently the professor already had a tenure-track position lined up at a university in the south, and his attorney was near the end of negotiations for settlement of a lawsuit against DePauw. Of course, we did not know of these last couple of developments or else the indignation we felt over Fornaro's dismissal would have been muted. The beautiful spring day still would have occurred and just as many students would have skipped class---it was a Friday and most DePauw professors "called" Friday classes in their courses.</p>
<p>   The American Association of University Professors had determined Fornaro's academic freedom was violated in the denial of his tenure. Fornaro was left-wing. The University announced that certain concepts of departmental needs supersede academic freedom. The fact Fornaro was left-wing had little to do with the denial of tenure, however. Many of the professors were left-wing. His true "sin" was to be in conflict with the head of the department. I was shocked, nonetheless, that a University would deem anything more important than academic freedom.</p>
<p>   A news story by Tony Lobianco yesterday reports that then-Governor Mitch Daniels had sought to ban Howard Zinn's writings from college classrooms in Indiana. Zinn wrote a "People's" history of America in which he tells the story of America in a way most people do not want to read or hear. Many acclaim Zinn's work. Some do not. On the first page, Zinn quotes a letter written by Christopher Columbus to his royal sponsors in Europe to the effect that the natives he found in the so-called New World were so docile and trusting that, with only fifty (50) men, he could subjugate them in the name of Jesus Christ. I love the book. It gives a view of American history to balance the white-wash we usually are given. (Kokomo right-winger Peter Heck hates Zinn's writings; another reason I like Zinn.)</p>
<p>   As governor, Daniels, apparently, sought to ban Zinn's writings from Indiana college classrooms. He also sought to retaliate against professors who were critical of the then-governor. Variety of opinions are to be encouraged in a university. Apparently Daniels views post-secondary education as a place to teach vocational skills and to punish those who do not fall into line. I doubt he met such practices as the alma mater that almost wasn't---Princeton University, where he was busted for selling LSD.</p>
<p>   Daniels appointed enough members of the Board of Trustees at Purdue University to make his hire there ethically questionable. Of course, he appointed a lot of the members of the boards of trustees of the State's universities, so I suppose he could have gone to any of the five main campuses. He probably chose Purdue because of the parties and the summer produce available in the community. Then again, there is The Frozen Custard. In any event, a tyrant---in politics, but especially in academia---should not be tolerated.</p>
<p>   Perhaps this sounds sexist, but the members of the Board of Trustees of Purdue University should grow the cajones to terminate Daniels's contract and send him packing. He might already have begun to eliminate departments, though, and so perhaps Spanish will be eliminated from the curriculum. In that case, the members should go back to the American slang and grow balls.

<p>   Last week, shortly before closing arguments began in State v. George Zimmerman, someone blogged about the view of the trial from the six seats that counted most at the end: the seats in the jury box. If one sets emotions aside, the reality of the jury becomes paramount.</p>
<p>   People can jest about a jury being made up of people not competent enough to get out of jury duty. However, every jury in front of which I have tried a case, once the oath is administered, has taken that oath and the duty it entails quite seriously. The jury's role is important, of course, but one must look at the factors to understand not only "why," but the nuances of that "why."</p>
<p>   First and most obvious, those jurors made the decision. A great many arguments were directed to the judge in regard to legal matters. All the arguments as to facts were directed to the jury. In Indiana, and in most if not all jurisdictions, jurors are instructed, whenever there is a recess or court adjourns for the day, not to discuss the case with one another. This jury, for obvious reasons, was sequestered. So their world, on the one hand, was of a common daily experience and schedule focused on the One Big Thing about which they could not talk.</p>
<p>   While in the courtroom, people---perhaps jury consultants, certainly members of the press and public, and definitely attorneys both for the State of Florida and the defense---watched the individual jurors for reactions to specific testimony, exhibits, whatever. At the same time, the jurors watched. Sure, they watched the individual witnesses. I read transcripts for appeals. After about 25 years, I can detect things that happen in court that come through the plain, black-and-white of the typed page. There obviously are more things that do not come through. The jurors hear certainty, or lack of certainty, in the voices of witnesses. The jurors might each differently interpret the body language of a single witness.</p>
<p>   The jurors also get to observe the reactions of the defendant to everything brought to the witness stand.</p>
<p>   At the end of the testimony and arguments, the jurors are instructed in the law. Jury instructions are extremely important. They constitute the basis for reversal of convictions. They also are taken quite seriously by jurors. A judge can impress upon jurors the importance of the instructions. Sure, one can argue the concept of "jury nullification," in which the jury decides the case as it wishes. In Indiana, the deliberations of a jury are not subject to examination except for specific reasons, such as intoxication or exposure to outside influences. Otherwise, if a juror were to say, in a drug case as an example, "I believe drugs should be legal so my vote is 'not guilty' and I don't care what anyone else says," there's not a lot that can be done. Most juries, however, do not entertain---probably are not aware of the concept of---jury nullification. I have not read that jury nullification came into play here.</p>
<p>   Imagine, however, having sat through all the testimony and arguments, not being able to talk with one another about the main thing you each have observed, your common experience of however-many weeks, and you just have been ordered back to the jury room to deliberate.</p>
<p>   The jurors' perspectives were the most important in the case. The day networks (if they still exist) place cameras and microphones in the jury box, will be a day things have become really perverse. Until then, this is a system we have had for the entire existence of our Republic. Jury duty provides a person with the chance to cast the most important and effective---one out of six or 12, not 100 million---vote one may cast in a setting. This is our system.   </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

We will stream from 11 am to 1 pm.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   The United States Navy gloated yesterday over the first successful landing of a drone aircraft onto the deck of an aircraft carrier. The Vice-Admiral in charge boasted "history" that our children and grandchildren and grandchildren would mention, had been made.</p>
<p>   I would say there should be no boasting. I would agree with the last part, but for different reasons than the Rear Admiral.</p>
<p>   Warfare advances technology. Sometimes those advancements are good. Many times they are not. We have improvements in commercial air flight, storage of food for long periods, medical care as to the former. As for the latter, we have poison gas, machine guns (thought by Gatlin, the originator of the Gatlin gun, to bring such horror that it would end war; that prophecy was a bit off), and, of course, The Bomb. One may argue the pros and cons of atomic weaponry, but its proliferation cannot seriously be debated. That eventually a power-hungry megalomaniac will have control of such devices should scare the hell out of everyone. Wait---how many countries aren't run by power-hungry megalomaniacs?</p>
<p>   Drone warfare was envisioned a long time ago. The primary development/deployment of drones came during the administration of President George W. Bush. The use of drones during the administration of President Barack Obama leads one to believe that someone has taken up with Barry Bonds's former steroid supplier. </p>
<p>   One statistic that slaps us in the face is the two percent (2%)---as in two (2) out of every one hundred (100)---success rate of drones hitting their intended targets. As I have written before in this blog, I cannot think of an examination in any school in which two percent (2%) passes as a grade. The "best" accuracy of which I have read is twenty percent (20%). If the reader remembers any test she or he passed in any institution with that as a grade, please let me know.</p>
<p>   The problem is compounded when one realizes the other ninety-eight percent (98%) out there is not dead space or empty ground. The drone misses whomever it was intended to hit and, instead, blows up a field or the side of a hill. So-called collateral damage means innocent people are killed. One may espouse the great strides we have made with drones, but they have really hurt us in the eyes of The World. That is not good. That means more people want to do ill toward the United States and our citizens, here or if we travel abroad. </p>
<p>    This latest development is the biggest step toward elimination of human pilots in fighter aircraft. Human beings have a difficult time with nine (9) Gs of force when they turn an aircraft at high speed in a tight turn. Drones don't carry people. Also, of all the flight maneuvers of aircraft, to land on an aircraft carrier---to place the craft onto the pitching deck of a ship at sea with wind conditions usually brisk, to state the matter mildly---is one of the, if not the, most difficult. For the Navy to have developed this aircraft, a model much larger than the drones now deployed by the United States, is scary.  In the item in Yahoo! the United States Navy spokesperson spoke---favorably---of how the new drone plane will eliminate human intervention in the aircraft's operation. Also, the design is on-track to be of a "stealth" type.</p>
<p>   The more "human intervention" is eliminated, the more human accountability is eliminated. The Constitution requires an act of Congress to wage warfare. If we let machines make decisions for us, then the machines are responsible for the deaths that result, not the people who issue the orders. At least that's how people who participated in the Milgram Study in the 1960s seemed to push off personal responsibility for acts ordered by others. Give people a few gadgets---machines kill people, people don't kill people---and you have carnage of the same type as a scene from one of any of several dozen sci-fi flicks or TV series.</p>
<p>   The last part that REALLY bothers me is that our computers are hacked. All of our computers---even those used for design of new weapons systems---are hacked. The designs of these aircraft have been paid for by U.S. taxpayers. The benefits might go to---let's see, what countries DON'T have hackers? Drones are relatively cheap, compared to traditional fighter aircraft. Eliminate pilots and one eliminates the need for accommodation in design for human beings. One also eliminates the need to train all those pilots.</p>
<p>   Yesterday might go down in history and be remembered in 100 years for what it was---a terrible day. Perhaps there is a Sarah Conner today whose son will combat Cyborgs that look like the former governor of California. Otherwise, these ill-conceived plans move ahead---under President Obama as they would have under President Bush and as they will, in all likelihood, under another President Bush or Clinton (who says we don't have dynastic rule in this country?) Now they won't have to screw around with training humans. Fewer kids will get military benefits to go to college because fewer in the military are needed.</p>
<p>   This no longer is the land of the free, for many reasons. Now it is becoming the Land of the Machine.</p>

<p>   A couple of years ago I happened to find a web page, via a link on The Kokomo Tribune (pronounced "TRIB-une" for those native to Howard County), to the Peter Heck Show. The image on the link was of an old-fashioned radio microphone. What I discovered surprised me, in a few ways. First, I found it difficult to believe people still rejected such matters of science as evolution or that homosexuals exist. Second, I questioned the propriety of a photograph that supposedly depicts a pile of disposed fetuses outside a clinic that provides women with health services to illustrate a piece in which the author opposes choice. Third, once I got onto the website's debate forum, I was surprised that, amidst the very far right-wing people who posted were some very thoughtful, albeit very right-wing people. Eventually I posted on the subject of whether the Constitution requires religious oaths. I used the handle "403US15," the Supreme Court reporter citation for Cohen v. California, in which the Court held a person has a First Amendment right to wear a jacket on which is printed "Fuck the Draft." Mr. Heck wrote on that thread to try and correct me on the points I raised. Eventually, after he questioned my credentials, I e-mailed him. He invited me onto his show. I was on twice.</p>
<p>   I should not have challenged him to a debate at the end of the second appearance on his show. I should have waited. I could not help myself. As much as he has derided Roe v. Wade, his comment about how we should debate something some time just struck a spark. After he accepted the challenge, he had second thoughts. I was not invited back to the show.</p>
<p>   Since then The Kokomo Tribune dropped him as a columnist, in a hypocritical fashion about which I posted. The radio station that carried his daily show dropped him, probably to replace him with cheaper programming purchased from a national corporation (only a guess, but that's how things go nowadays). Now his show, The 414 Project, is carried on "Indiana Talks," the same internet network that carries "Civil Discourse Now" on Saturdays 11 am-1 pm.</p>
<p>   Mr. Heck's views are "different." His latest piece questions the scientific validity of evolution as a theory. In a commencement address in May he mentioned something about women and CEOs that caught the attention of national media. I invited him onto "Civil Discourse Now" a couple of months ago, but, sadly, did not receive a reply to my e-mail.</p>
<p>   I believe "Indiana Talks" is a great network because it has a variety of opinions expressed. I disagree with Mr. Heck about many things. One of his favorite starts to a speech is the mention of Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or give me death!" oration. Sadly for Messrs. Heck and Patrick, there is no first-hand evidence such a line was given in Henry's speech. We do have a letter he had written to a cousin in which Henry lamented that slaves, and he owned people as chattel, were so convenient. Henry's line would have been more accurate had he said: "Give me liberty! Give them death!" That doesn't carry the same effect on a crowd. This would be a minor matter but for Mr. Heck's Master's degree in history. One would have thought he would know about primary and secondary sources for historical information.</p>
<p>   As he is now on "Indiana Talks," I hope we can talk once again. Maybe he even will consent to that little debate the challenge to which he accepted and on which he then reneged.

<p>   Candidates ran for office. They promised a certain approach to govern, amongst the most important  that the government would not be a theocracy and everyone would be considered equal. 2012 elections were won by a candidate for president whom people trusted to keep his word. Immediately he backtracked. He assumed "near-dictatorial power to enact a hastily written constitution---one that, Islamists crowed, lacked many basic right."  TribLive, 6/29/13. People, angry over this turn of events that ignored the beliefs and wishes of their votes, took to the streets. The people also were angry that the United States would continue to back the man elected, only a year ago, who acted in a way that betrayed concepts of liberty. The military---a constant presence that monitors government action and was, at the least, complicit in the removal of Mubarrek from office, again took action. The 48-hour deadline it gave the president passed. The military moved. President Mohamed Morsi was removed from office.</p>
<p>   Meanwhile, in the United States, the minority party of the two major political parties in our system, maintains a tenuous hold on power. Because it successfully gerrymandered districts after the last, 2010, census, it has ensured itself majorities in state assemblies where no majority for it exists in the particular state. Aided by a Supreme Court, several of whose members were nominated by a President who left office with favorability ratings lower than those of Richard Nixon shortly before Nixon's resignation, that has handed down rulings---Citizens United and last week's decision on Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, the R's will solidify the hold of aging white people.In the meantime, legislation is blocked, money is funneled to the military instead of infrastructure, and not much seems capable of being done.</p>
<p>   e.e. cummings wrote: "A politician is an ass/upon which everything has sat except a man."</p>
<p>   Which country better exemplifies the "Spirit of '76"? The United States, where we have accepted the rule of people funded by corporations; people with greater concern for re-election than for the good of the people? Representatives who cannot secure enactment of legislation if it is favored by the president---unless, of course, it is legislation that grants sweeping tort immunity to Monsanto? And what about the President? I thought all that governmental secrecy would be anathema to a former professor of Constitutional law.</p>
<p>   If the people of this country took to the streets in the millions, as the people of Egypt have, so recently, in Cairo, let's face it: we would face tanks just like the guy in Beijing would held the shopping bags. Sad times, these are, when it would appear the people of Egypt are more free, and more interested in active protest than are the people of this country.  </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   John Adams wrote that July 2 would go down in history as the day this country declared its independence from England.

Of course, there are other minor errors in modern knowledge about the initial events that gave start to what became the United States of America. Our country was born in irony or paradox, but perhaps hypocrisy would be as good an adjective.</p>
<p>   All men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, amongst these being life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...</p>
<p>   For starts, the "overthrow" of the British occurred on North American soil in Massachusetts in 1774. There were rumblings in the intervening two years. For another, Paul Revere did not make his historic ride. He was stopped by British soldiers. Samuel Adams is remembered as a firebrand who whipped up colonists against the British king. Again, this is a bit "off." Samuel---only later, and after his death, were references made to "Sam" Adams---for the most part counseled against "independency." He did not like to drink and put his father's brewery into bankruptcy. (Never trust a thin cook and never trust, to run a brewery, a tee-totaller.) The Boston Tea Party, of which many today are so proud, was an occurrence of which many were embarrassed at the time it occurred. Drunken vandals dumped cargo into Boston Harbor. </p>
<p>   The "revolution" was a rebellion. There was no overall change of the social structure. Many of the same upper-class, white males still held positions of power similar to those the same men held prior to the outbreak of hostilities. (The Who probably had it right when they sang "here with the new boss/same as the old boss" in "Won't Get Fooled Again.") The same economic system, patched together as it was, operated. Northern states, fairly quickly, abandoned the institution of slavery, but not out of higher moral principles. They simply did not have such things as plantations on which slaves could work to the owners' profit. Southerners, on the other hand, clung to that evil institution.</p>
<p>   The Constitution was drafted and the new Nation was on its way.</p>
<p>   There is the huge paradox/hypocrisy. The institution of slavery was allowed to exist. Another paradox/irony is that even when slavery formally was abolished in all States shortly after the Civil War (and in Mississippi with its passage of the Thirteenth Amendment earlier this year), women would not receive the right to vote or recognize other aspects of equality and "freedom" until the early 20th Century.</p>
<p>   There were some 60 offenses for which the penalty was death. Blasphemy---"irreverence toward a religious icon or something considered sacred---was a crime for which, in some instances, the guilty party's tongue would be bored out. The First Amendment was a nice sentiment, except when free speech and assembly, for examples, were inconvenient. When people demonstrated against the Civil "War"---and I use quotation marks only to distinguish that conflagration from wars waged under the Constitutional provisions for declaration of "war"; President Lincoln wanted to make clear that the leaders of the Southern States had, through secession, committed treason and therefore were outside some of the niceties of formal war (although bodies blown apart by lead still are bodies blown apart by lead)---and World War I, they were arrested. When free speech holds no threat of actual change, people are free to talk all they want.</p>
<p>    Today, here in the "land of the free," we have such a large population of prison inmates that we account for 25% of the World's total with only Five percent (5%) of the World's population. That means we have more people in prison than North Korea and China. Our telephones and internet messages are monitored. We are searched and shaken down by uniformed officials when we board aircraft---unless you're wealthy enough to own a private airplane, in which case there are no metal detectors at a private flying service---or enter certain public buildings. Informally? Try to remain seated when, at the start of a sports event, everyone is asked to stand and remove their hats as someone sings the English drinking song to which Francis Scott Key adapted lyrics that became "The Star Spangled Banner." We have satellites that can zero in on our backyard cookouts (we'll have ribs) and mini-drones that soon will buzz around wherever and whenever some kid at a console in wherever it is such things are controlled and monitored decides to buzz by. Did you think that was a hummingbird? Think again.</p>
<p>   I know what someone is about to say or think: Don't like it here? Love it or leave it! That person has a right to her or his opinion. This is, after all, the "land of the free." "Love it or leave it"? I say---change itr or lose it. Don't get all syrupy about the stories handed down to us about our early history. Stand up and try to change things. Object to what has happened. Write---as in hand-write---letters to people in Congress. Bitch about what goes on. Read. Listen. </p>
<p>    There are other countries whose citizens enjoy far more freedom than the citizens of this country. Of course, if they try to brag about that, we might just pull up in one of our aircraft carriers and blow their sorry asses away. Hey, bub! You can't blaspheme against the United States! We are the land of the free! And if you don't believe it, we'll wipe you out!</p>

<p>   We got home and I went out onto the deck to read, go on-line to check some things for The Show, and to smoke a cigar. The evening was mild and pleasant.</p>
<p>   Then I heard a voice over a PA, from the direction of the Indianapolis Art League, make a couple of announcements. After that music started. The first band was very good. The other music was good, but the first band was striking. I could not understand the lyrics the lead vocalist, a female, sang, because of the distance. But her range was fantastic and the background music, especially the keyboards on a couple of numbers, were very interesting. I checked out the schedule from last night's program at the Art League. Apparently the band is Matt &amp; Kim. The experience was really cool. I could sit on the deck and listen to (what is to me) new music played "live."</p>
<p>   The only similar experience I have had was when I lived in Kokomo, in a basement apartment a couple of doors down from the Armory. I was slightly intoxicated and stepped outside one evening and heard a Freddie Fender song playing. I realized, after a few moments, it was Freddie Fender himself as he sang one of the covers he did that were hits and he was performing at the Armory. I went back inside. Nothing against Freddie, but I wasn't really big on his work, and it fell short of being worth the risk of acting as a target for passing gun enthusiasts in that part of Kokomoville.</p>
<p>   Matt &amp; Kim? I had less risk on my deck, and the music not only was original w/them, but it was better. Kind of a neat Broad Ripple experience. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   The United States Supreme Court certainly was busy this week. Guest panelists Miah Akston, Andrew D. Kirch, and Jeff Cox will discuss with me (Paul continues on his vacation) the DOMA, Prop 8, and Civil Rights Act cases handed down by the Roberts Court.</p>
<p>   Each of the cases has interesting nuances. The Prop 8 case had a bizarre combination of justices join in a single dissenting opinion. Usually when justices of such diverse views as Justices Kennedy, Thomas, Alito and Sotomayor dissent from a case, either each will dissent separately or two will join in one dissent or there will be four dissents with various justices joining in one or another of the dissents. Justice Kennedy wrote the dissent in which the other three joined.</p>
<p>   I agree with the notion that there should not be discrimination against same-sex couples who wish to marry. The opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, however, skirted the substantive issue. Referenda were created so that the voters of a State could circumvent politicians who want to block popular will. United States Senator Robert "Fighting Bob" LaFollette of Wisconsin was a champion of such populist reforms to government. The voters of California---deluged by ads, many of which were purchased by the Mormon church, groups backed by the Koch brothers, and other corporate interests (total: $39 million); and from groups that opposed the measure ($44.1 million), about the same percentage of each side's money originating from outside the State of California---approved Proposition 8 in November, 2008. Suit was brought by two couples who wanted to marry but were now denied that opportunity by the newly-revised Constitution of California.</p>
<p>   Neither Governor Arnold Schwarznegger nor Attorney General, past- and now-Governor of California, wanted to defend Proposition 8 in the United States District Court in which suit had been brought. Individuals who originally had been proponents of the ballot initiative sought the status to defend the lawsuit. The United States District Court certified a question to the California Supreme Court---a little-used but valid means by which a Federal Court can determine an individual State's law---as to whether these individuals had standing to defend Prop 8. The California Supreme Court said "yes." "Standing" is a party's legal right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right; to have standing in federal court, a plaintiff must show: 1) that the challenged conduct has caused him or her injury in fact, and 2) that the interest sought to be protected is within the zone of interests meant to be regulated by the statutory or constitutional guarantee in question. Black's Law Dictionary, Pocket ed., 1996, p. 590.</p>
<p>   Once the California Supreme Court had ruled on standing, the matter was not at issue until the case arrived at the United States Supreme Court. Even the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, while split on the substantive issues of the case (they ruled, btw, that the District Court was right and Prop 8 was unconstitutional) had been unanimous in finding the proponents had standing.</p>
<p>   However, by a 5-4 majority, the United States Supreme Court found the proponents lacked standing to bring the appeal. Therefore, the District Court's decision stands.</p>
<p>   The Show today will be interesting and fun. Bill Smythe, Clause &amp; Annie's owner, has graciously allowed us to shoot in his establishment. Also, discussion of the cases should also be fun.     </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:512;s:7:"headers";a:14:{s:4:"date";s:91:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 19:41:58 GMT, Thu, 15 Aug 2013 19:25:10 GMT, Thu, 15 Aug 2013 19:25:10 GMT";s:6:"server";s:20:"Ning HTTP Server 2.0";s:7:"expires";s:60:"Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT, Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";s:10:"set-cookie";s:284:"xn_visitor=0c9cf846-00f0-4363-90f8-3e074b7c1268;Path=/;Domain=.civildiscoursenow.com;Expires=Sun, 13-Aug-23 19:41:58 GMT, ning_session=JLVbPCA4pfiDeR/+zOAxYpzv36/EwbnXvpxCjmyIxyS2iLSizyXh7NkM/mbDylXiTA7i4OUTjSU=;Path=/;Domain=.civildiscoursenow.com;Expires=Thu, 15-Aug-13 20:41:58 GMT";s:16:"x-xn-trace-token";s:36:"a047eb95-7a5d-46cc-a3a7-1035f85e8ea4";s:11:"x-xn-xnhtml";s:5:"false";s:4:"vary";s:16:"X-XN_APPLICATION";s:3:"p3p";s:36:"CP=UNI STA LOC CURa OURa COR ALL IND";s:18:"xg-bazel-validslug";s:5:"false";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 19:25:10 UTC";s:13:"cache-control";s:30:"max-age=0, no-cache=Set-Cookie";s:12:"content-type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"36734";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130725024141";}
