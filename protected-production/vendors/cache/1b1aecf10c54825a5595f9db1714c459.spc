<p>What a Year! It’s been an exciting semester. Apart from my work at the CFV, I took my last semester of undergraduate classes, decided to move to the Chicago next fall, experienced cattle-call dance auditions (and the accompanying rejection), and got all nostalgic about leaving the place that has been my home for the last four years. Lots of things have been changing, and it’s been wonderful to know that I will always be welcome at the CFV after I graduate. Thinking back, I guess I’ve really spent a lot of time in the house this year. I hosted yoga once per week as part of Mind, Body, Spirit Tuesdays, I attended lots of group meetings, and I sent an ungodly number of emails to get ready for Interfaith Baccalaureate. I’ve loved every minute of it, but it was certainly a lot easier since it was my second semester in this position. And, if I’m being honest, there are things I learned on the job which, had I known earlier, would have changed my approach.<br />
Working with the faith groups on campus is such a wonderful job, because, in essence, you just get to hang out with people and make new friends. I remember the first MSA meeting I went to; by the time the meeting ended, I was on the MSA listserv and had an invitation to go to dinner and a haunted house with some members of the group. For someone who likes to talk to people, this part of the job was perfect. The difficult part about interacting with the faith groups is that, occasionally, you have to actually plan some events. And let me tell you, Butler students are busy. I discovered that mass emails are NOT the way to go if you want people to attend an event. I had much better luck when I got a few leaders form groups on my side and, essentially, had them do the recruiting for me.<br />
I was a little disappointed that it was consistently the same few groups that were willing to do interfaith activities. I understand that interfaith isn’t important or even on everyone’s radar. Unwillingness to be involved in interfaith seems contrary to the Butler Way, which confuses me because most Butler students seem pretty in-tune and supportive of the Butler Way in any other setting. I wonder if some groups just think that they shouldn’t be interested in interfaith; maybe one good experience with interfaith work is all it would take to make unwilling faith groups realize how much it fits with their own ideals. I wish I had been able to find a way to test that theory while doing this internship, but maybe it just takes time and a gentle but persistent interfaith presence.<br />
Planning Baccalaureate was so much fun, but it also involved a lot of pestering via email. The biggest struggle was getting people to take 5 minutes to invite their friends to the Facebook event, which was funny because many of them sent me a copy of their speech for Baccalaureate within a few days. I think the secret to this is persistence in person. I tried to remind people whenever I saw them because that made me feel less guilty than sending a ton of emails. And it turns out that I got better results from that anyways.<br />
My last wish for this internship is that more faculty members become involved in interfaith. There were a few that I could count on, but most of that was because their students were already planning interfaith projects. I think getting help from faculty would help people see the interfaith presence on campus, and maybe make the shy ones more willing to join the movement.<br />
Interfaith, right now, has a very small role on this campus. But it is also a welcoming and friendly role, a role that is eager and willing to invite others in. I hope that this position stays alive in the CFV for many years to come and that, slowly, it will gain a bigger following at Butler. It is such an important part of the CFV and is a wonderful chance to work with some great people.</p>

Many students look forward to that magical graduation date when they will suddenly be equipped &#8220;to do something to make the world more sensible or more peaceful or more civil or more intelligent,&#8221; as the late Dr. Marshall Gregory says in his forthcoming book, Good Teaching and Educational Vision: Not the Same Thing as Disciplinary Expertise. These students misunderstand the key to this challenging quote. When Gregory urges us &#8220;to do something&#8221; beneficial to the people around us, he doesn&#8217;t exhort students to wait four years to start. That would be silly. As Boris Pasternak wrote in his novel Dr. Zhivago: &#8220;Man is born to live, not to prepare for life.&#8221;[1] The community of the Liberal Arts and Sciences encourages its students to actively pursue rationality, civility, and peace in the present moment through integrity of thought and action.<br />
Our educational system&#8217;s logic proceeds as follows: perform well in middle school in order to get into high school honors classes. Achieve excellence in high school in order to be accepted to a renowned university. Excel in college in order to get a good job. Get a good job in order to retire early, so that you can putter around for a few years before dying. Right? The Liberal Arts and Sciences has broken me out of this rut by removing the phrase &#8220;in order to,&#8221; freeing me to concentrate on the world I live in, not the world I plan on occupying. Otherwise we end up following someone else&#8217;s orders until we go tumbling off a cliff like lemmings.<br />
When I enrolled in EN 455: Writing In Schools, I wasn&#8217;t aware I would drive to Shortridge High School twice a week to make sandwiches. That&#8217;s right, bologna sandwiches with that rubbery cheese. Unlike other collegiate classes, this one wasn&#8217;t an opportunity to learn so much as an opportunity to act in the world. The focus was on helping the Shortridge students, not our grades. Utilizing our experience studying creative writing, we mentored the students in writing poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. We fed the students to ward off distraction, joked around with them like peers, gave them writing exercises, and supported them in any way we knew how. My proudest moment was watching the shy eighth grader I had worked with stand up in front of the whole class and present her poem about how irritating it can be dealing with annoying people. It was a special moment for all of us.<br />
As a student of literature, I must ask myself how time spent analyzing The Divine Comedies or The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn prepares me to make the world &#8220;more congenial to human flourishing,&#8221; as Dr. Gregory put it. My answer came in November of 2012. A professor in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences came under attack by a student for the wording of her syllabus. Although the article was not hateful in and of itself, a number of thoughtless, hateful, and bigoted messages were sent to the professor as a result.<br />
I wrote two articles in response to the event that I posted on my blog. Taking as measured and rational approach as possible, I examined first the student&#8217;s argument and granted that there may be class curriculums that treat certain genders, ethnicities, or sexualities less favorably than others. Then I looked at the language used in his article, which claimed that the professor was asking the class to &#8220;disavow&#8221; their identities. The actual wording asked for students not to take any single type of identity &#8220;as the norm.&#8221;[2] My training taught me how to challenge the blatant misuse of logic and rhetoric, especially because of the harm it was causing to another person. I challenged that the twisted wording undermined the credibility of the author&#8217;s argument.<br />
Within hours I was the new target of vitriol from online users that underscored the importance of Dr. Gregory&#8217;s call to civility and rationality.<br />
My faith in the importance of the Liberal Arts and Sciences community came later that week when an open forum was held to address the situation. This conversation embodied the spirit of the Liberal Arts and Sciences. The word &#8220;conversation&#8221; originates from Latin &#8220;com-&#8221; meaning with and &#8220;vertere,&#8221; meaning to turn.[3] A true conversation involves two or more people &#8220;turning together&#8221; through thought. In this way the community navigated through this trying situation. For example, many attendees of the forum instinctively wanted to cast aspersions at the student author. The community guided each other away from such sentiments, because they lacked integrity, respect, or relevance.<br />
It was important that the open forum was separated from the virtual realm. With online comments, a person can carry their extreme opinions, express them, and never worry over who they hurt or what reaction they provoke. The online community is a collection of disparate, anonymous, and isolated speakers who aren&#8217;t required to listen or engage in conversation with the rest of the community. The open forum resisted this phenomenon by fostering rationality, civility, peace, intelligence, and the growth of those speaking and listening. Everyone brought their opinions, but had to engage with others and acknowledge, if not agree with, the their thoughts. It was the catharsis necessary to ease everyone&#8217;s frustration and extinguish the fire that had raged on Facebook and Twitter for days.<br />
Marshall Gregory&#8217;s words embody the spirit of the Liberal Arts, and express how my studies have been more than educational. They have given me the drive to actively participate in the world, the opportunity to defend against dishonest discourse, and the clarity to live a deliberate life.<br />

<p>by Ann Herbert</p>
<p>The decision to major in Religion was not an easy one. I was worried that studying religion wouldn’t lead to a job and that everyone I met would think I was a religious fanatic of some sort. Frankly, the decision came down to going through the course bulletin and highlighting all the courses I wanted to take. It was clear once the religion section was completely yellow that I would go this route. Still, I was uncertain about this decision so I handled it with humor. I remember standing up at a Religion/Philosophy Department dinner to explain to a group of fellow students that I chose to major in Religion in order to start a cult. Something I have yet to accomplish. But, my decision to study religion at Butler has turned out to be good one and one that I would suggest to others considering it.</p>
<p>While attending Butler, I was heavily involved with the Center For Faith and Vocation, which, among other things, afforded me the opportunity to participate in a Field Seminar to Nicaragua. This seminar included a trip to Nicaragua over spring break where we met with various religious leaders who were representing diverse roles in the country and who held divergent religious views. This trip was my first trip abroad and played a significant role in my decision to study abroad in Ecuador. Since then I have lived in Morocco and Germany and will likely have an international career. My studies in religion were the first exposure I had to learning about other people in different cultures and is one thing I took away from this major.</p>
<p>At Butler, I took courses that ranged from a broad overview of the world’s major religions to a micro-view of an Islamic mystic poet, Rumi. I did walking meditation in <i>Asian Philosophy</i>. I wore a headscarf for a day and wrote about the experience for <i>Muslim Women in the Middle East</i>. I wrote a paper using various theories of religion to prove that my sorority was in fact a religion. Coming from a small town in rural Indiana where I was only exposed to Christianity this was an eye opening experience to say the least. Studying religion opened my eyes to other ways of thinking and living in the world. I became a more well-rounded and open person having learned about diverse belief systems which is something I think is crucial in todays increasingly diverse world.</p>
<p>Because I was interested in different ways of thinking and living due to my exposure to different religions through my course work, I applied to Peace Corps. I was open to going to Morocco when many others were frightened at the prospect of living in a Muslim Country in the post-9/11 era. I wanted to see how Islam was practiced on an everyday basis. Not only did my background in religious studies lead me to Morocco, but also my experience in Morocco was much richer having studied the religion, as it is a major component of the average Moroccan’s worldview.</p>
<p>Following my Peace Corps experience, I could have done many things and the basic skills I gained as a religious studies major at Butler would have been enough preparation for most jobs I would have applied for. As a religion major I gained competence in reading, writing and critical thinking. These are the basic skills necessary for any job.  Jobs are basically seeking applicants that can do these three things well, learn quickly and are motivated to work, all of which a religious studies major at Butler is more than capable of.</p>
<p>I, however, chose to go to graduate school because I wanted to supplement my training in the humanities with a more quantitative base in the social sciences.  Paired with my Peace Corps experience, my excellent undergraduate performance afforded me a choice of top graduate schools offering a range of support. The fact that the religion department at Butler is small and is willing to work closely with students, advising them both academically and professionally, has been a huge advantage. I was able to thrive and grow in that supportive environment, which played a significant role in how well I did during my studies and subsequently what other opportunities became possible. The faculty was available both during my time at Butler and after. I have repeatedly returned to them for advice, contacts and other support. I actually applied to the University of Chicago where I just completed a Master of Public Policy Program because a Butler Religion Professor, Chad Bauman, directed me to this school. Finding a department where the professors believe in you and are willing to work with you is one of the most important aspects of an undergraduate education, and I am thankful to have experienced this at an optimal level in the Religion Department at Butler.</p>
<p>Additionally, having studied religion makes me unique and allows me to stand out from the crowd. It is a rare major that allows me to contribute a unique perspective. Through my courses I gained the ability to talk intelligently and respectfully about a controversial subject and to approach problems in a more creative, holistic way. Religion happens to be a part of most people’s lives all over the world in one way or another and therefore having studied it allows me to provide a pertinent and important perspective.</p>
<p>Lastly, for me, taking time to think about what I believed and finding out more about what others believed was a crucial step in my personal development. Knowing where I stood on fundamental things such as whether or not I believed in God has influenced most decisions I’ve made since. I had the luxury to think about big questions such as, “what is religion?” and “what role should it play in a democracy?” These are topics that most people consider to be a luxury to think about and I got to dive deep into them for four consecutive years.</p>
<p>Now if asked, “Why Study Religion at Butler?” by someone who is interested in the subject I would reply by saying you learn basic skills that are necessary for any job, you gain competence in a field that applies to anyone anywhere, you will get exceptional support from the department that will allow you to thrive academically and professionally, and you will stand out and provide a unique perspective. Needless to say, I am very happy I chose to study Religion at Butler.  In fact, I am very proud of my decision to major in religion. It has led me to where I am today, a place that I am very happy with.</p>

<p>Greatness<br />
“Greatness,” is you. “Greatness,” is the goal you aim for. “Greatness,” is anything and everything around you.<br />
This message to the Indianapolis Community from Common, the distinguished American hip hop recording artist and actor, spoke with depth.<br />
Greatness is achieved through a three-step process. “Find your path, believe in your path, and live it,” Common stated.<br />
Finding your path can be a challenging process. We are consistently pressured to figure out our future and contemplate where we plan to see ourselves in the next five years. This is a difficult question to answer, one which we ponder on every day. But how do you answer? Every now and then, the answer comprises of the broad fundamental goals of having a successful career, loving family, and a good life. But it goes deeper than that. What do you actually want out of life? What greatness do you desire to achieve?<br />
Believe. Believing can go a long way. Investing your spirit into your aspirations can take you further than any expectation. Once you find that path, it cannot sustain itself without belief. Belief is what drives it to the act itself.<br />
Live it! How else can you desire after something but choose not to live it?<br />
With this motivating message, what’s next? Where do you start? How do you figure this out?<br />
The answer: Utilize your resources.For one, you are not alone. The people that surround your everyday life battle with this question themselves. They may have more insight into these issues than you may realize.<br />
There is also an assortment of resources available to you that can guide you through this process. One of these resources is the Center for Faith and Vocation.<br />
The Center for Faith and Vocation is dedicated to helping others discover this inner greatness. It is committed to supporting people through this process of self-discovery and helping put it into action. This period of personal development is essential in anyone’s life, no matter the age, and the Center for Faith and Vocation recognizes this. Through internships, on-campus programs, one-on-one counseling, and opportunities for international travel, the Center for Faith and Vocation provides the needed support in the exploration of these issues. It proffers that next stepping stone to discovering your life of purpose, meaning, and contribution; your greatness. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of great things going for me this January.  The first was that I went on a 2-week trip to sunny Eastern Cuba for the second time to dance and do thesis research.  The second is that I began a class that I created for myself (Butler will let you do almost anything if you ask nicely) about mantra.  For the class, I&#8217;m chanting &#8220;gate gate paragate parasamgate bodi swaha&#8221; (gone gone, gone beyond, beyond the gone-beyond, so be it) for about 4 hours a week and then journaling about it.  I think the best way to tell you about these experiences is to share my first journal entry that I wrote while I was still in Cuba:</p>
<p>I was planning on waiting, but I guess that it&#8217;s fitting that I&#8217;m starting to read The Way of the Pilgrim (a book I&#8217;m reading for my class about a man who chants) while I&#8217;m traveling in Cuba.  I realized this while reading the foreword of the book.  The write quotes Gabriel Marcel on his idea that order will be established on earth when each person understands that he or she is only a figurative traveler here.  I’m a literal traveler right now so here is what that means to me in this moment:<br />
1.) I&#8217;m living out of a suitcase and I don&#8217;t want to unpack everything because I know I&#8217;ll have to move again soon.  I think the pilgrim&#8217;s physical body is his &#8220;suitcase&#8221; here on earth.  It sounds like he barely takes care of his body.  He hardly ever eats, he walks and sleeps outside in the snow with tattered old shoes, he doesn&#8217;t want a home.  But the things inside his &#8220;suitcase,&#8221; his soul and connection with God, he takes care of those very well.<br />
2.) I have to roll with the punches.  I&#8217;m going to be disappointed if I expect a consistent schedule or to know what&#8217;s going to happen two days from now or to be in a car with adequate safety features.  I&#8217;m living day to day.  For a change.<br />
3. I need to be ready to part with my belongings.  If my Cuban friend needs my chapstick because it&#8217;s expensive in Cuba, I give her mine and make due without chapstick for the rest of the trip.  It&#8217;s weird how attached we get to little things like headphones and pens and chapstick when they&#8217;re so easy to get in the U.S.  But for that reason, it makes more sense to give those things to people that don&#8217;t have them.<br />
4.) I&#8217;m careful to not waste.  I haven&#8217;t thrown away or left a single mini bar of soap or  roll of toilet paper in any of our hotel rooms because those things are also hard for Cuban people to get.  And I know that when I get back to the U.S., I&#8217;ll have a hard time throwing away napkins or dumping out cups of water.  It makes me upset to think of how much water it takes for a shower.  I&#8217;ve been showering with a gallon and a half of water in a bucket for the past week and I&#8217;m doing just fine.  It makes me even more upset to think that in a couple weeks, I&#8217;ll probably be back into my old wasteful habits…<br />
I&#8217;m grateful to have a traveling experience as I read The Pilgrim; it gives me some perspective.  As I read, I&#8217;m picking out phrases that jump out at me.  For example, the pilgrim discusses wanting an experience in constant prayer (chanting mantra) rather than a mental study of it.  And, hey, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing right now with this mantra class.  I&#8217;m learning about mantra by DOING rather than just by reading about it.<br />
I tried my mantra for the first time today.  I chanted for 20 minutes while I held ice on my knees.  Hours of dancing on cobblestone is awful for your body.  I started chanting in my normal speaking tone and after only a few minutes, my throat started to hurt.  It felt like my vocal chords were straining from speaking in a low voice even though it wasn&#8217;t all that low.  Around minute 10, I realized that my volume had been getting softer and softer.  I decided to observe this rather than to try to change it.  See? Rolling with the punches.  My voice kept getting softer until finally, I &#8220;broke&#8221; into a whisper.  I say &#8220;broke&#8221; because the change in effort to continue in a whisper felt so immediately relaxing that it was like releasing something I&#8217;d been holding too tightly.  It was so freeing.  The last 5 minutes went by smoothly, and I was surprised when my alarm went off to tell me that my time was up.</p>
<p>The way I think about Cuba and my practice keeps changing as I settle back in to America and dive into mantra.  It already feels like a month since I&#8217;ve been home and the vividness of Cuba&#8217;s atmosphere and warm weather is being replaced by the reality of this awful winter.  Still, I&#8217;m glad to be chanting at home and I&#8217;m so lucky that I was able to begin my mantra journey as a traveler.</p>
<p>Peace,<br />
Lauren</p>

<p>At the end of a semester, I&#8217;m always ready to run back to my apartment and sleep off my finals. After a few days, though, I snap out of it and finish tying-up loose ends of the year. One of those &#8220;ends&#8221; is to reflect on my internship with the Center for Faith and Vocation. My internship, as the CFV&#8217;s Interfaith Liaison, let me interact with all the faith groups on campus, connecting them to each other and the CFV. I attended events, blogged about them, and sent lots of emails to support the groups. Judy asked me to reflect on how my work has related to my own life. This threw me a little. When writing for the CFV, I feel guilty deviating from what I see as &#8220;the important parts&#8221; of this internship so my instinct is to be academic and leave my personal life out of it. But when I think about the Center, its crew, and what they stand for, I realize that it&#8217;s silly of me to think that way. The CFV is one of the most individualized places I&#8217;ve ever been. The purpose of the House is to see each person as an individual with unique problems, situations, and needs. And the people who work there are good at it, which is why I’m about to reflect upon this internship and my personal life. Well done, Judy. Here I go.</p>
<p>In the dance world, we often talk about making ourselves into &#8220;well rounded dancers.&#8221; There&#8217;s a misconception (especially among younger dancers) that you should focus all your energy one style of dance to be the best. Ie, if you want to be a ballerina, it doesn&#8217;t do you any good to study ballroom dance, you should spend that time practicing ballet instead. I&#8217;m not saying that this is the way most dancers (especially those at Butler) think, but for some dancers, it is. For a dancer to limit himself or herself by only studying one style is silly because, one, there are very few companies that do exclusively one style and, two, you get a much richer experiencing by learning a little of everything. The same thing can be said about having more than one passion. A dance major&#8217;s academic schedule is packed and doesn&#8217;t usually allow for other activities so we often get stuck in a cycle of dance class, homework, and sleep. This internship has helped me set aside time to find meaning outside of dance because I get to work with people and learn about religions- two things I love. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Dance is my calling. But there are days (as there are in any profession) that make me want to get out of the dance studio and having something else to turn to keeps me grounded. While it makes my schedule busy at times, this internship helps make me a &#8220;well rounded person.&#8221; When I&#8217;m able to invest in something that really calls to me, it gives me meaning outside the dance world. I&#8217;ve found that this semester at the CFV.</p>
<p>Maybe this is because of my structured background in dance, but I had a hard time adjusting to this type of work. I&#8217;m used to work that involves punching in and sitting at a desk for a prescribed amount of time, producing some tangible results. At my other jobs, numbers matter. X attendees to an event is a success, anything less than Y means I did something wrong. Every time that I bring up my nervousness about numbers, the gracious Judy has tried to get me to shift my thinking. My role, Judy says, is to extend an interfaith invitation to everyone and if no one responds, no problem; I’ll just ask again the next week. To be honest, this is the kind of work environment I would choose if I had my pick of them all. I suppose I&#8217;m just surprised I landed such a perfect gig. Go Blue House! I&#8217;m so lucky to have been able to do the good work of the CFV. I&#8217;m really looking forward to next semester when I&#8217;ll get to come back and learn more about our campus faith groups.</p>

<p>I traveled home to Cincinnati this past weekend in hopes of getting to vote for the 2012 presidential election in early. I had procrastinated on getting my absentee ballot and had an urge to get off campus anyway so I figured I would vote in person. As I made it to downtown I was surprised to see that most of the city was dead, barely a person in sight, and on a Saturday afternoon this was uncommon. But as soon as I turned my car towards the Elections Board building I knew why the rest of the city was quiet. It seemed as though everybody in the downtown area had converged to the two-block radius surrounding the only early polling site. I parked and sat in my car just looking at the barely moving line and tried to convince myself that it wasn’t worth the wait. But I concluded that I had already driven two hours from Indianapolis, so what would another half hour be?</p>
<p>Three hours later when I finally dropped my freshly marked ballot into its box and received my “I Voted!” sticker I had never felt more accomplished. I stood alone in line for three hours shivering in 40-degree weather as the sky kept spitting out rain. Being a 21-year-old young white female alone in a predominantly African-American crowd I was uncomfortable. Not scared, not suspicious, just uncomfortable. Those handing out political propaganda and the politicians continuously ignored me because they either didn’t care about my vote or decided in their mind that I was going to vote a certain way. But I did it. I voted. Don’t get me wrong, every 20 minutes or so I decided I was just going to get out of line and go back to the car with heated seats and drive to the closest Starbucks for a grande hot chocolate. But I didn’t. And I want to say it was all because of my own will power and convictions but really it was peer pressure. I was surrounded by so many people who were so excited and so willing to wait even more than three hours to vote for somebody they truly believed in. I was not only inspired by their dedication but also slightly ashamed of my indifference. But that indifference slowly faded away as I was able to think (three hours is a long time) about why I was voting.</p>
<p>In a phone conversation with my dad a few days before I admitted that I felt that my vote wouldn’t even matter. He immediately said, “Do you know where you come from? Cincinnati is one of the most democratic cities situated in one of the most republican counties, in one of the biggest battleground states. Your vote may change the whole election!” Well, when he put it that way how could I not vote? But I was still conflicted on who to vote for. I knew that my personal beliefs aligned strongly with one candidate but my parents’ aligned with the other. In those three long hours I struggled on what my ballot would say. Most of the people in line with me were open and proud Obama supporters, so what would one vote for Romney really do? But on the other hand many of my core beliefs matched Obama’s stance on social issues. Do I vote for a candidate who could help my family and our economy or do I vote for a candidate I think will push our country into progress with social issues?</p>
<p>In the end all that matters is that I voted. I voted for the first time in a presidential election. I voted as a way to fulfill my civic duty as a US citizen. I voted for the women who came before me and sacrificed all they were for my rights. I voted for myself, for my beliefs, and for my future.</p>

<p>The Blue House asked me to reflect on my internship and what I&#8217;m learning.  I&#8217;m about due for some reflection.  I usually put my head down and go go go until the end of the semester, waiting to reflect until I&#8217;m at home on my couch eating Christmas cookies.  But reflection is important (hey, that&#8217;s the first thing I&#8217;ve learned) so here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking about my internship and life as of 8:25 this morning:</p>
<p>1. College is for growing, not learning.  Sure, I&#8217;m learning things in my classes and that&#8217;s important.  Let&#8217;s be real, though; I won&#8217;t remember a lot of the details a few years from now.  What matters (to me, at least) is that I can take personal meaning from what I&#8217;m learning.  That&#8217;s why my religion minor and this internship feel so right to me.  I understand how to take themes I&#8217;m learning and apply those to my understanding of myself.  I have a dance teacher who always says that dance class is about &#8220;collecting sensations&#8221; rather than copying movement.  With enough practice, anyone can move the same way the teacher does, but understanding how the movement feels and where it&#8217;s coming from and what it means to YOU is a different story.  In college, anyone can learn facts; it&#8217;s tougher to know how to grow from them.</p>
<p>2. Numbers don&#8217;t count.  Working in ResLife has gotten me used to numbers.  I should have at least 5 people at each program I host.  I can use x% of my budget for this event.  It&#8217;s a pragmatic and effective way to do things and it&#8217;s what I knew, so I brought it with me to this internship.  I&#8217;m still getting used to the way the Blue House functions because it&#8217;s all about the presence on campus rather than the number of people who come through the house.  What matters most is that we are available.  It&#8217;s ok if I don&#8217;t reach everyone, but I&#8217;ll really invest in the people I do connect with.  It&#8217;s so liberating to have permission to focus on a few people rather than to desperately try to engage everyone.</p>
<p>3. Talking with people is the best way to serve.  As people, we all need lots of things, right?  We need food and money and friends and an education (preferably in something sustainable).  It is so easy to want to provide these things, especially to those who are close to us.  As a CFV intern, I want to give each of Butler&#8217;s faith groups funding, students, and publicity.  And lots of it.  Almost 3 months in, I&#8217;m starting to realize that I haven&#8217;t been exactly realistic.  I can&#8217;t give each group everything I&#8217;d like to but I&#8217;ve had some fantastic conversations with student leaders that were more meaningful than a strategic blog post or financial donation.  We need a lot of things, but one thing that we tend to overlook is the need to be listened to.  I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;ve been able to provide that in lieu of giant money bags.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at.  I&#8217;m so, so grateful for this opportunity to learn and share.<br />
Peace,<br />
Lauren</p>

<p>Being the communications intern for the Center for Faith and Vocation I find myself, well, communicating, a lot. I email, Facebook, greet, tweet, chat, listen, and laugh. You’ll usually find me on my computer or my phone corresponding with student organizations, Butler faculty, students, community members, and other CFV staff. And I love it. I love being able to create a connection between the larger Butler community and the CFV. If I am even able to get one student to the CFV who has never been there I feel accomplished because I was once that student. As a freshman I didn’t really understand what the CFV really was or what it had to offer. And never trying to find out is probably one of the biggest regrets. The CFV has become a place for me to come and work, relax, meet, study, have fun, and most of all make connections. Not just professional connections but personal, spiritual, and enlightening bonds. I’ve meet people who have helped me see that what I do with my future is up to me and the possibilities are endless. Besides getting great professional experience I’ve gained a better understanding of what I can do with those experiences to further myself. I truly believe that from working at the CFV I gained confidence in my ability to go after my goals which I will be doing this spring by studying abroad in London for 5 months. Being able to talk out my hesitations and fears with the CFV staff I was able to see that I can overcome any challenges. Be it planning an event such as Big Questions or planning for my future on a different continent. The CFV has not only been an employer but also a friend, mentor, and inspiration.</p>

<p>A dancer at the Hindu Temple Fest; this is a great example of the beautiful costumes!<br />
This past Saturday I was able to attend Temple Fest, at the Hindu Temple of Central Indiana. I did not real-ize that the Hindu community in Indianapolis was so large; there are almost 10,000 Hindus around here! It was an exciting experience, and the closest to another culture I have been able to get without traveling. It also included lots of Hindu dancing, which was a wonderful thing to experience.<br />
The atmosphere of Temple Fest was somewhat like walking into India for a brief bit; there were multitudes of people gathered in a tent, milling around different attractions, and I was definitely in the minority as a non-Indian person. This was a very interesting experience, since it happens so rarely in this country as a Caucasian person. The environment of the festival was wonderful; the energy was high and the feel was festive. Everybody was gathering around food tables, the stage where the dancing was, or chatting in smaller groups. There were people of all ages enjoying the festivities, from tiny babies in colorful, elabo-rate Indian costumes to older people. It was a lovely event to be a part of.<br />
The food and culture was amazing. I partook in eating some Indian food; although the food was unfamiliar and quite spicy, it was delicious, and very eye opening to experience cuisine that was different even from the more American versions of Indian food we usually get in this country. I was also able to experience walking around inside the actual temple, which is still a work in progress but already very large and beauti-ful. It was amazing to be integrated so fully into another culture and religion for the day.<br />
The highlight for me, of course, was the dancing I was able to watch. There were several different groups of classical Hindu dancers, of all ages. Each group had intricate, colorful, and sparkling costumes, which really complimented the dances they performed. Most of the groups performed classical Hindu dance, which was completely different from other kinds of dance I have seen. It was intricate and involved several symbolic movements that showed the religious influence. There was also a bit of Bollywood dancing, which is a sort of popular dance in India. It combines classical Hindu dance forms, belly dancing, Indian<br />
folk dancing, and even Western styles of dance; it is very popular in movies from India. It is important to understand the distinction between the religiously influenced classical Hindu dance and the more secular form of Bollywood. It was nice to see examples of both within the same festival to illustrate this difference.<br />
It was also great to see how friendly the Hindu people were. While I was eating, a nice gentleman started up a conversation. After explaining who I was and describing my project, he ended up introducing me to the Hindu dance teacher at the temple. This was exciting, and gaining such a wonderful contact was an unexpected bonus. It felt so personal, and it was wonderful to meet new and interesting people. I talked to the dance teacher, and she was extremely friendly and immediately enthusiastic about my project. I really hope she can be involved in one of my events!<br />
Overall, attending Hindu Temple Fest was a wonderful experience that I would definitely recommend to others. Even if you are not Indian or Hindu, the community as a whole is so accepting, friendly, and excited to share their culture with others. It is amazing what wonderful events I discover when I look for them! Indianapolis has many vibrant cultures to explore, and Temple Fest was a way to experience the Hindu culture.<br />
Below, I have included pictures of one of the groups of dancers I saw perform. Also, there is a link to the Hindu Temple of Central Indiana. Stay tuned for more information about my first dance and religion event!</p>
