<p>The latest adventure of everyone's favorite X-Man is easily better than his last solo outing (not a tough job, admittedly), <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>, but I also think it's the mutant's best overall outing in terms of story, cinematic value and action. That being said, there is still a great deal about the film that didn't connect with me, and there are a couple of elements in <em>The Wolverine</em> that are downright terrible.</p>

<p>Taking on my personal favorite era of the original Wolverine comic books, <em>The Wolverine</em> tackles Logan's (still Hugh Jackman) time in Japan, where he falls in love with Mariko (newcomer Tao Okamoto), the granddaughter of Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), one of the richest men in Japan, who happens to know Logan from their time together in the last days of World War II. Yashida sends one of his associates, the red-haired, future-seeing mutant Yukio (Rila Fukushima), to bring Logan (voluntarily living in exile) to his deathbed so he can say good bye to his old friend. But it turns out Yashida really wants to syphon off Logan's healing factor so he can live longer. Knowing Logan doesn't enjoy the prospect of living forever, Yashida thinks Logan might go for this plan, but he refuses, and the old man dies, leaving his entire fortune and business to Mariko instead of her father Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada), who immediately tries to have his daughter killed so he can take over the business.</p>
        <p>There are more twists and turns and double-crossings in <em>The Wolverine</em> than I care to detail here. There's the guy that Mariko is arranged to marry, and there's the guy she actually loves, and neither one seems that important to the story. And then there's Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), who might give the single worst performance in any <em>X-Men</em> or superhero movie ever. And it would have been so easy to write the character right out of the film. Sure she doses Wolverine with something that inhibits his healing powers and makes him vulnerable, but there were ways to make another character do that. Sure, she's beautiful and looks great in her skin-tight costume, but I promise you will cringe every time she speaks.</p>

<p>I found it strange that the filmmakers opted to have Wolverine go without his healing powers for so much of the film. It reminded me of <em>Iron Man 3</em>'s decision to have Tony Stark out of the armor for so much of that movie. Sure Wolverine still had his adamantium claws and general animal rage, but after a few well placed cuts and bruises, the man becomes pretty weak and vulnerable.</p>

<p>From an aesthetic point of view, <em>The Wolverine</em> is top notch. The beautifully filmed views of both modern and ancient Japanese locations were a great choice, and director James Mangold (<em>Cop Land</em>, <em>Walk the Line</em>, <em>3:10 to Yuma</em>) does a great job mixing the practical with the digital. There are some lasting images in this movie that floored me, including one of Wolverine charging through a small town to rescue Mariko and getting pierced with what looks like hundreds of arrows attached to ropes to hold him back. His claws are out, his body is pitched forward, but he's frozen in time and angry as hell. It's like an image right out of Kurosawa's <em>Throne of Blood</em>, and it's magnificent.</p>

<p>Another aspect of <em>The Wolverine</em> I liked involved his dreams/nightmares, mostly involving Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), usually lying in bed with him, wishing he would join her in the afterworld (presumably she's tempting him to take his own life). It gives Wolverine the smallest sense of vulnerability and desperation, and helps us understand why living forever (or at least for a very long time) seem unappealing to him since it would keep him for reuniting with his beloved Jean. The device may not work for some, but it did for me.</p>

<p>My biggest overall issue with the movie was that there's simply too much story. Specifically, there are too many side stories, unnecessary right turns and about faces; it became exhausting after a while. Wolverine fighting ninjas is badass. Him trying to rescue Mariko, whom he's fallen for and vice versa, is great stuff, especially since she knows a little martial arts herself. But all of this nonsense about the company and Mariko's other men weighs down the film. I really love that, with the exception of Jackman and Janssen, most of the faces in the film will be unfamiliar to mainstream American audiences. It's a bold move, and it adds to the authenticity of the adventure. </p>

<p>The big final battle between Wolverine and the robotic, super-sized Silver Samurai is pretty solid as well, but since we know Wolverine shows up in the next X-Men movie, that slightly undercuts our concern for his well being. Still, there are other things our hero can lose besides his life, as you'll see.</p>

<p>Side note: the film seems to set up Yukio as a possible sidekick for Wolverine, but I'm pretty sure she's not in the already-crowded <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, which is kind of a bummer because she's great. Oh well. There's certainly enough here to keep the die-hard X-Men fans happy, as well as the folks who just want to see Jackman without his shirt on for great stretches of the film. As always, I'm eager to see where Logan takes us next (and don't leave right when the credits roll if you want to find out).</p>

<h3>Blackfish</h3>
<p>There's one particular fact that stuck in my mind after watching the sickening, heartbreaking documentary <em>Blackfish</em>, which concerns the practice of keeping killer whales, or orcas, in captivity for entertainment or breeding purposes at venues like Sea World, where in 2010 trainer Dawn Brancheau was dragged under the water during a performance and torn to pieces by a massive orca named Tilikum, a whale that was likely responsible for two other deaths in its history as a performing animal. Someone in the film makes the very important point that, although there are hundreds of reported deaths and injuries to trainers by whales held in captivity, there has never been a single attack on human beings by orcas in the wild.</p>

<p><em>Blackfish</em> isn't just about Tilikum, although the whale's long and troubling past is certainly the focus of this documentary that seeks to expose Sea World and places like it for its barbaric practices when it comes to housing, training and exploiting these 8,000-lb. creatures. What's more maddening, as the film exposes, is how the various water parks cover up or deny the fact that their holding facilities are in any way the cause of these attacks by literally driving these animals crazy. </p>

<p>The filmmakers don't simply hurl allegations; they collect a large number of former whale trainers &mdash; mostly from Sea World; many of whom knew Brancheau &mdash; to detail the park's practices and policies. Tilikum has lived in captivity for 30 years, since it was captured at age two near Iceland. And several animal experts make the fairly obvious case that anything in captivity that long would likely be driven insane; I believe someone even uses the word "psychotic." But more horrifying, although we are spared any graphic video of Brancheau's death, there is plenty of other footage of captive whales attacking trainers. One particularly terrifying bit of film involves an orca dragging its trainer to the bottom of its deep tank over and over again like its a game, mangling the man's leg in the process. Good luck with that one.</p>

<p>But the message of <em>Blackfish</em> isn't to be afraid of killer whales; it's to urge sea parks to give up what is admittedly their number one attraction. Trained orcas are more impressive than, say, trained dolphins simply because of their size, but that always makes them far more dangerous when they decide they don't like being held captive any longer. What's most infuriating about Brancheau's death is the way Sea World executive tried to blame her death on trainer error, saying her ponytail hitting the water somehow provoked the attack, but those who were there tell a different story. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite's exhaustive research into every aspect of this unnecessary death and the practices that caused it will stick with you for a long time to come, and you'll certainly think twice before going to Sea World again or buying one of their cute little stuffed orcas. Black Fish is fascinating, harrowing food for thought. The film opens today at the Landmark Century Center Cinema.</p>

<h3>Still Mine</h3>
<p>The only reason I won't label the sweet little film <em>Still Mine</em> "quiet" is because lead actor James Cromwell is so angry and occasionally yelling, usually at the local bureaucrats in his community, so we get where he's coming from. The true-life story concerns Cromwell as independent farmer Craig Morrison, whose wife Irene (Genevieve Bujold) is clearly in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and she is having trouble remembering even the simplest things about getting around their two-story house. In an effort to simplify their living arrangements, Morrison decides to build he and his wife a smaller, simpler, one-story home right next to the big house, and so he starts cutting wood and begins to build it himself. End of story, right? Not exactly.</p>

<p>Morrison's father was a shipbuilder, so the knowledge of wood and building a solid structure is in the man's blood. But that doesn't stop the local building inspector (played as sympathetically as possible by Jonathan Potts) from sticking his nose in and demanding the building cease until blueprints are drawn up and submitted, and the work done so far is inspected by him. Naturally, the man finds dozens of nit-picky violations, most of which Morrison deals with as instructed, but he doesn't take kindly to having his sound work delayed, and he takes it out on this man with the red tape.</p>

<p>What follows are meetings with lawyers (including Morrison's attorney, played by Campbell Scott), inspectors, city planners, and eventually a court case, after Morrison just decides to start building again after he gets tired of sitting around while his wife suffers. Director Michael McGowan has woven together two very nice stories into <em>Still Mine</em>. One is the never-sappy love story between Craig and Irene, which is tested and wrought with his stubbornness and her frailty. Despite the urgings of their grown children, Morrison refuses to put his wife in a home. The other is a surprisingly subversive movie about standing up to the government and that common sense must win out over the letter of the law sometimes.</p>

<p>No pun intended, but there isn't a whole lot of new ground being broken with <em>Still Mine</em>, but I believe time has proven that Cromwell is one of the most highly watchable actors working today, and he elevates the material into something quite moving at times. And it's great seeing Bujold in anything again. Highly recommended if you're looking for something safe to take your parents or grandparents to. The film opens today in Chicago at the Landmark Century Center Cinema.</p>

<h3>In the House</h3>
<p>I missed this film when it originally opened in the U.S. a couple of months ago, and I'm glad I was able to catch it since because it's a brilliant, mildly sleazy slice of wonderful that you should check out if given the chance. Those who follow French cinema know that a new work by writer-director François Ozon (<em>Under the Sand</em>, <em>5x2</em>, <em>Swimming Pool</em>, <em>Potiche</em>) is reason to take notice, and <em>In the House</em> is certainly gives us an excuse to get excited. Based on the play by Juan Mayorga and adapted by Ozon, the story involves Germain (Fabrice Luchini), a high school literature teacher bored with his life, and his wife Jeanne (Kristin Scott Thomas). </p>

<p>To amuse himself, he assigns his class to write a personal story, something akin to a journal entry, but what he gets from one student, Claude (Ernst Umhauer), is something far more interesting. He turns in the beginnings of a story about becoming friends with Rapha (Bastien Ughetto), so that he can get into the other boy's house to watch his family's behavior. Rapha's mother, Esther, is played by the radiant Emmanuelle Seigner, so you can imagine at least one of the reasons he wants to spy on this family. As Germain and Jeanne read Claude's story, they get completely caught up in his storytelling, and want more. So Germain cleverly critiques the boy's work and asks him to continue.</p>

<p>What is so interesting about the way <em>In the House</em> is told is that we never know for sure whether what Claude is telling us is true or only partly true or a complete fabrication. At various times, we suspect each. But Ozon keeps us guessing and it makes Claude's behavior all the more creepy. Speaking of creepy, there even comes a time when Germain's over attentiveness to the boy is called into question. Without even realizing it, Germain goes from coaching the boy in writing to telling him what he should do next with the family he's carefully observing, and in the process, the film transforms from a clever mystery to an outright thriller.</p>

<p>With stories like this, we know that all of this deception is going to blow up in someone's face, and we're pretty sure we know who throughout <em>In the House</em>, but that doesn't make it any less fun waiting to see what for the explosion will take. It's a beautifully smart little film armed to the teeth with great actors doing amusing and edgy work. Scott Thomas is particularly good as an art dealer trying to find the right exhibit for her museum before she gets fired by her ridiculous bosses. She uses these stories as an escape from her tense life, and to forget that her husband hasn't touched her since he started reading these stories.</p>

<p><em>In the House</em> is a commentary on how our society has become one of watcher and not doers. Voyeurism (through reality shows, the paparazzi, etc.) has left us content to sit at home and watch version of who we used to be live out lives that we clearly could in most cases, if we'd only turn off the TV and put down the magazine long enough to go outside. The film in no way expresses this overtly, and it doesn't need to. Ozon is too smart for that, and this film is a tremendous cautionary tale about not getting too caught up in the lives of others. The film opens today for a weeklong engagement at the Gene Siskel Film Center.</p>

<h3>3rd Annual Chicago French Film Festival</h3>
<p>One of my favorite of the newer breed of festivals that has moved into Chicago in recent years is the Music Box Theatre's Chicago French Film Festival, which typically brings 10-12 of the latest features from France, usually featuring early glimpses new works from some of the nation's best actors and filmmakers. This year's event also includes a special screening of the French-German co-production (and one of my personal favorite films of all time) 1987's <em>Wings of Desire</em> from director Wim Wenders; and the rarely screened 1972 Jean-Pierre Melville work <em>Un Flic</em>, with the great Alain Delon as well as Richard Crenna and Catherine Deneuve (it wouldn't be a French Film Festival without her).</p>

<p>A complete list of all of the films in the series and the schedule for the weeklong festival can be found at the Music Box's web site (http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/festivals/3rd-annual-chicago-french-film-festival/films), but I want to tell you about two particularly interesting works that show the range of films this series offers. </p>

<p>The Opening Night film is <em>Fly Me to the Moon (Un Plan Parfait)</em>, from director Pascal Cahumeil, about a family of people who believe they are cursed to have all of their first marriages fail (with the understanding that the subsequent marriage will be a success). The idea of this curse is so pervasive that when Isabelle (Diane Kruger) is on the verge of marrying to the man she thinks she truly loves, she decides to take a quick trip to another country where she will meet a man, marry him quickly, and then divorce right after. Naturally, the poor sucker in question, travel writer Jean-Yves (Danny Boon), falls madly in love with Isabelle and unknowingly complicates her scheme. It's a very silly film, but there is undeniable charm when Kruger and Boon engage in their many verbals battles. The film is more daring than pretty much every Hollywood-made romantic comedy, but the appeal is much the same. Probably the most mainstream of the festival's offerings.</p>

<p>The Closing Night film is the incredible <em>11.6</em>, the true-life story of armored car driver Toni Musulin (<em>The Intouchables</em>' Francois Cluzet), who managed to pull off one of the biggest heists ($11.6 million) in France without using a weapon or having a (knowing) accomplice. His plan was so intricately thought out that he would have gotten away clean, but he willingly turned himself in while he was in hiding and gave up the location of the missing millions (most of it). What director Philippe Godeau does that is so extraordinary is make sure never to paint Musulin as some kind of master criminal; he's just careful, keeps to himself without appearing to do so, and even manages to cut off ties to his restaurant owner girlfriend and his best friend/co-worker, so as not to implicate them in his crime. <em>11.6</em> is tense, beautifully acted and mesmerizing as we try to figure out exactly how this seemingly average man pulled off such an unbelievable crime. I feel confident the film will make its way back to the states for a limited run, but if you get a chance to see it at this festival, you should.</p>

        <p><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/were_only_in_it_for_the_money.jpg" alt="We're Only in It for the Money" width="300" class="right" />Tonight at Tony Fitzpatrick's <a href="http://www.firecatprojects.org/">Firecat Projects</a> gallery, an exhibition of artwork by <a href="http://www.ralf.com/">Cal Schenkel</a> tonight from 7 to 10pm. Schenkel is best known for his cover art for Frank Zappa and Reprise Records, as well as many others. </p>

<p>Schenkel's first collaboration with Zappa was on the cover for the Mothers of Invention's <em>We're Only in It for the Money</em>, which brilliantly parodies the Beatles' <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> cover art. He went on to produce many of Zappa's album covers and liner designs, as well as for other bands. The one you're probably most familiar with is Captain Beefheart's <em>Trout Mask Replica</em>, for which Don Van Vliet <a href="http://www.united-mutations.com/s/cal_schenkel.htm">posed for photographs for hours</a> with a hollowed-out carp head on his face.</p>

<span class="s"><em>Left: </em>Trout Mask Replica<em> study, acrylic on paper; right: final cover art</em></span></p>

<p>Much of Schenkel's current artwork is looser and more abstract, and in some cases very cartoony. On of his recent pieces was featured for the book cover of Turtles lead singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Kaylan">Howard Kaylan</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shell-Shocked-Turtles-Eddie-Frank/dp/1617808466">autobiography</a>.</p>

<p>Schenkel will be present for the reception tonight, and no doubt will have plenty of stories to tell. Firecat Projects is located at 2124 N. Damen Ave. The show will be viewable Monday through Friday, 10am to 4pm, through Aug. 20.<br />

<p><a href="http://getgass.com/">Craig Gass's</a> comedy grind began in the early 90s with gigs at "whatever crappy bar or club would have him"; that grind eventually paid off and led the way to regular appearances on "The Howard Stern Show," guest-starring on hit network sitcoms like "The King of Queens," and a quite memorable role on HBO's "Sex and the City." Today, Gass is well-known for his hilarious celebrity impressions that include Christopher Walken, Gilbert Gottfried, and Al Pacino, and starting tonight and throughout the weekend, he'll be bringing them, along with many others, to Zanies' Rosemont and Chicago locations. Recently, I spoke with Gass to talk about the state of celebrity impressionist comedians, why Tracy Morgan is his favorite celebrity to perform and of course, <em>that</em> "Sex and the City" episode. </p>
        <p><strong>I read that you learned how to talk from mimicking people on TV because both of your parents and your sister were hearing impaired--is that really how things began for you?</strong> </p>

<p>I couldn't learn how to speak from my own family, which is really key in your early development. But being that my family was deaf, I had a clean slate on how to communicate and how to speak so I learned how to talk by copying all the voices I heard on TV. And I never got an accent from the Bronx, which is where I grew up. I always tell people, if you know who Tracy Morgan is, that's like everybody in my neighborhood. "Everybody in the Bronx talk like this, whether you black or white!" [<em>in Morgan voice</em>]</p>

<p><strong>Lately, there seems to be a resurgence of celebrity impressionist comedians--do you think this area of stand-up comedy is making a comeback? </strong></p>

<p>I started doing stand-up comedy 20 years ago and the feeling that I got when I first started was that comedians--and a lot of them still feel this way--hated comedians who did impressions. If you can do an impression you can get a cheap laugh from people because you don't really have to say anything; you can just do the voice and people will laugh. So as a result, it became uncool to do impressions. But when I first started, I didn't do any impressions at all on stage, then one night, I was hanging out with a comedy club owner who heard me doing some impressions of people and he said "Where did you learn how to do that?" So I told him my story and he said I should do it. I told him, "Oh comedians hate that," and he said "Who cares--put your own spin on it, you don't have to do it the way everyone else does." So I started doing them on stage and now, it's what I'm mostly known for--doing voices for "Family Guy," "American Dad" and "The Cleveland Show."</p>

<p><strong>Christopher Walken, Al Pacino, and Adam Sandler, to name a few, are all celebrity impressions you do. Do you have a favorite? </strong></p>

<p>I like Adam, but I personally love Tracy Morgan because he reminds me of so many people I grew up with. Plus, Tracy has no filter--and when I say he has <em>no</em> filter...</p>

<p><strong>Yes--we've all been witness to the 'filterless' Tracy Morgan...</strong></p>

<p>That guy walks up to me one night at a comedy club. And I could see he was looking at me and I could also see that somebody was pointing at me and telling him, "You know, Craig's family is deaf." And like five minutes later, he was standing next to me and he looked at me and said, "So "Craig your family's like retarded, right?" I'm like, "No, they're deaf--they just can't hear you." He said, "Oh so they wear, like, football helmets and sh--?" I'm like, "No--they can't <em>hear </em> you!" And he goes, "So can they see?" [Laughs]. This dude is crazy. But I love that man--he's hilarious.</p>

<p><strong>How would you describe your process? Does the impression naturally come to you? Do you have to be a fan of someone and then you work on the voice?</strong></p>

<p>Usually the voices get stuck in my head so if I'm a fan of somebody, I'll hear their voice over and over again in my head. The weirder the voice, the easier it is for me to do because it's something to actually shoot for as opposed to someone who has a normal voice or a normal cadence. If someone has a normal voice or a normal cadence, it's hard to distinguish a sound that sounds unique. If you have someone like Christopher Walken, [<em>in Walken's voice</em>] "He's got a real stop--and go--voice, where he'll talk every once in a while then he'll stop--then he'll keep going." So it's really different and easier to grab. It's the normal voices that you have to listen to for a while to find a unique rhythm. But I'm very lazy--some voices are just right there. I just hear it very clearly in my head. </p>

<p><strong>How do you go about perfecting your celebrity impressions? Besides voice or inflection, do mannerisms, facial expressions, etc., come into play for is it really all about the voice?</strong></p>

<p>For me, it's about their whole being and when you see me doing impressions, I'm actually thinking of the person. I'm not thinking of their voice--I'm thinking of the entire person and their voice just kind of comes out. It sounds cheesy, but that's how it is. </p>

<p><strong>Who have you tried--or wanted to try--but just haven't for whatever reason(s)?  I've heard Aries Spears say something along the lines of if he can't master someone he just doesn't go there...</strong></p>

<p>Well, it's hard to do women's voices. But I wish to God I had one ability, and that is to sing. I wish I could sing like some of my favorite singers, but I don't. With Aries, I think it is so cool because he not only does voices but when he does famous rappers, there's something "sing-songy" about it that I really admire because it's a whole other talent to sound like some of the music artists that he can do. Then there's Eddie Murphy, who would talk about Michael Jackson and sing beautifully like him or he would sing beautifully like Stevie Wonder. I wish I could do that but I can't sing! I am like, the worst singer in the world! </p>

<p><strong>For a some time now, especially recently, Jay Z has become a part of lots of impressionists' routines. What do you think it is about him, specifically, that makes him so popular among comedians? <br />
</strong></p>

<p>Jay Z is so huge. It's like 20 or more years ago, there would be 10 comedians out there who would do a Jack Nicholson impression because he was such a huge part of pop culture. Jay Z is the biggest name in hip hop, so you're gonna have people do an impression of him. </p>

<p><strong>Earlier, you mentioned that it is hard to do women's voices--which got me thinking: Where are the female impressionists? Except for "recent" moments like Tina Fey's spot on impression of Sarah Palin, you really don't see women on stage doing this. Do you think this will change eventually?</strong></p>

<p>That's a good point. I've never even thought about that. Tina did a great Sarah Palin and there was a girl on "America's Got Talent" and she was so good--she did a Sarah Silverman impression that just blew my mind. There should be more women out there doing that, but women in comedy tend to go more towards alternative comedy, like an Amy Schumer type of comedy where it's really shocking. But I haven't heard too many female comedians at all do impressions and there should be more out there. </p>

<p><strong>You're also an actor and you appeared in hit shows including "King of Queens" and "Las Vegas"--but what I'm sure all the ladies remember you as <a href="http://www.tv.com/shows/sex-and-the-city/cover-girl-176339/">"Glazed Donut Man"</a> from "Sex and the City!"</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I am actually the "glazed donut man." My character dated Miranda [Cynthia Nixon] and I have to tell you--I had to perform that sex act for 19 hours.</p>

<p><strong>That uhh, "downtown" scene took almost a whole day of taping?</strong></p>

<p>I have a crazy story about that. I was right there; I mean, my face was <em>right</em> there. And I had a really bad self image at the time, because I put on 35 pounds to be on the show because [our characters] met at a Weight Watchers meeting. I told her, "I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, just tell me what you wanna do."  She said, "Just have fun, but make sure to keep your mouth right here," and she pointed to the inside of her thighs. We did that all day long. I kept trying to make small talk with her because I felt so uncomfortable that I was doing that to her all day. I kept trying to have some [general] conversation like "What kind of music do you listen to?" I mean, I just talked about anything! At one point, I then said, "You have a kid in real life, right?" She said, "Yeah." I said "Are you married?" She said, "No I've been dating this guy."  I asked her how long and she said, "Oh, like 12 years." I said, "Twelve years, really? How is that going?" And she just said, "Ehhh, it's whatever." The next thing I know, she got knocked up that weekend, had a kid, and nine months later announced to the world, "I just had a baby and I am leaving my man and I am a lesbian." All my friends were like, "Dude, you turned her gay!" [Laughs]</p>

<p><strong>You arrived in town this week in advance of your shows at Zanies how has your time in Chicago been going so far? </strong></p>

<p>It's all about the food--Giordano's pizza! But I've just been enjoying the city because there's just coolness about Chicago; there is an energy that I love that is just so very real. It's such a big city but people are so down to earth. I love being in Chicago and I've always had great shows and have met really cool people. I'm so glad I'm here. </p>

<p><strong>What can the Chicago audience expect from a Craig Gass show?</strong></p>

<p>Well, with all the food I'll be eating, I'm probably gonna be pretty gassy! I love dirty jokes but I'm a good person, so if you're not easily offended, you should be able to have a great time at my show. I love hearing a great story and I love telling a great story, so that's what the show's gonna be. </p>

<p>The sign outside the theater says, "This is a rock musical. It will be loud." And it starts loud with a four-piece rock band playing preshow music including the classic "Seven Nights to Rock." </p>

<p><em>Rooms: A Rock Romance</em> is a fairly traditional musical, punctuated by some great rock and punk rock songs performed on stage with a band. It is, at its heart, a love story about two people with different visions of life. Monica (Hillary Marren) wants to be a rock star, to travel and perform all over the world and Ian (Matt Deitchman) is a musician who prefers to stay at home in his own room with his guitar. </p>
        <p><em>Rooms</em> was written by Paul Scott Goodman and Miriam Gordon, with lyrics and music by Goodman, and was an off-Broadway hit with runs in Los Angeles and London. </p>

<p>The story in set in late 1970s Glasgow, London and New York. Monica, a singer-songwriter who describes herself as a Scottish-Jewish princess, and Ian, a rocker, meet in Glasgow. She hires him to write and play a song for a relative's bar mitzvah, for which Ian and the band members don yarmulkes. Monica and Ian hit it off musically and personally and decide to go to London to join in the burgeoning punk scene. Both cast off their mainstream clothing for punk leather, studs and ripped clothing. They have a hit song in "All I Want Is Everything," which zooms up the chart, finally hitting #1. Their big chance comes when their record label is bought by EMI and they are offered a US tour, with a gig at <a href="http://www.cbgb.com/">CBGB</a>, the iconic punk club on Bowery in the East Village. </p>

<p>This is where the two musicians' discordant visions trip them up. Ian, who has a history as a drinker, doesn't show up for the CBGB gig. Monica goes on solo and then decides to launch a solo career. The love complication is that Monica is pregnant and plans to have an abortion. <br />
 <br />
Ian returns to Glasgow to a lonely life where he sings, "I never want to leave this room." But he does. He joins a group to kick his drinking habit and succeeds. In the meantime, Monica decides to keep the baby and stays in New York where their son Glasgow Miller Wallace is born. Two years later, Ian, now clean and sober, comes to New York to find Monica and a happy ending takes place.<br />
  <br />
The band, The Diabolicals, plays background throughout and backs up the two musicians on their stage numbers. The very sharp band is made up of Cook on piano, Chuck Zayas on bass, Sam Brownson (and occasionally Deitchman) on guitar, and Matthew Sitz on percussion. Some of the music has a punk flavor; however, most of it is roots rock or straight-up rock. The singers' solos are often ballad-like and most of the dialogue is sung in musical-theater style.<br />
 <br />
<strong>What's in a name?</strong> <br />
<em>Rooms</em> is the last play of Broken Nose Theatre's inaugural season. It's always fun to wonder about the origin of the name of a band or a theater company. Broken Nose tells us how the name was drawn from a Nelson Algren book, <em>Chicago, City on the Make</em>: </p>

<blockquote>"Yet once you've come to be part of this particular patch, you'll never love another. Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may well find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real."</blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center;">~*~</div>

<p>Broken Nose Theatre will present <em>Rooms</em> until August 11 at the Collaboraction Pentagon space in the Flat Iron Arts Building, 1579 N. Milwaukee Ave. Performances are at 8pm Thursdays through Sundays. <a href="http://roomschicago.brownpapertickets.com">Tickets</a> are $30 and can be purchased online; for more information, call 312-226-9633. <br />

        <p>Flight, super strength, or invisibility? Everyone wonders how extraordinary their lives would be with a super power. But what would that be like, really?</p>

<p>Platoon of Power Squadron (PoPS) is a web series where four twentysomething roommates suddenly find they can stop time, control electricity, read minds and multiply themselves. </p>

<p>It's an earnest take on the superhero genre, trading epic battles for Whedonesque realism and banter. The Platoon members are less "superheros" and more "people who happen to have super powers."</p>

<p>"It's very much about these four people who have these powers that they aren't using," said writer-director Jake Jarvi. "They feel like they're worth so much more than they're letting themselves be."</p>

<p>This theme of untapped potential and an uncertain future is a common thread among many shows about twentysomethings today, but PoPS explores it in a funny, unique way. "Girls" hasn't branched out into time-traveling wormholes or disobedient clones quite yet.</p>

<p>Jarvi assembled the platoon back in 2009 after returning from LA, where he found some success as an actor and filmmaker, including a role as one of the pledges in the movie Old School. </p>

<p>This team of friends includes Jarvi and his wife Eliza Toser, Carlyn Janus, and Craig Benzine, who has gained notoriety as YouTube vlogger <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/wheezywaiter">Wheezy Waiter</a> since the show began. </p>

<p>They filmed the first episode of PoPS in their Logan Square apartment, and every episode since has been an all-volunteer affair, produced with a bare-bones crew during epic 10-hour-long shoots. </p>

<p>Raising money through Indiegogo campaigns- and to a lesser extent, YouTube ads- the show delivers a very high level of quality in spite of its barely-existent budget. This is thanks to the months that Jarvi spends on editing and special effects work at his home in the north suburbs.</p>

<p>The show has been well-received online, as a global community on YouTube has tuned in to the first six episodes and kept in touch with Jarvi's progress on the latest installment through weekly blog updates.</p>

<p>"It never occurred to me that you could have an international audience in the tens of thousands," Jarvi said. "I don't know if we'd be on episode seven right now if they hadn't turned up."</p>

<p>Just released today, the latest episode of Platoon of Power Squadron continues a new chapter in the story: a villain has entered the picture. This mysterious evil is seeking power by any means necessary, and only the Platoon of Power Squadron can stop it- unless it finds them first. </p>

        <p><img alt="Hedwig_1.jpeg" src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/Hedwig_1.jpeg" width="525" height="393" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" />"I was born on the other side of a town ripped in two," Hedwig sings in the opening song of the rock-opera <em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em> presented by Haven Theatre and now playing at <a href="https://www.theaterwit.org/">Theater Wit</a>. "I made it over the great divide -- now I'm comin' for you."</p>

<p>Born in communist East Berlin, Hedwig (played by Ryan Lanning) leads a traumatic childhood, to say the least. To escape from a cold mother and bleak life, Hedwig finds a comforting spot in the house -- the family's oven -- and listens to rock and roll musicians like Tony Tennille, Debby Boone, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KaWSOlASWc">Lou Reed</a>. Rock music becomes Hedwig's hope, as does Luther, an American GI. With gummy bears in hand, Luther meets Hedwig in an abandoned bomb crater. As it goes, Luther (aka "sugar daddy") asks Hedwig to marry him -- only problem, well: penis. Luther worries that customs will do a full body search and deny them marriage.  </p>

<p>At its core <em>Hedwig </em>is about a person who must make choices, for freedom, for love, for rock and roll. It's about self-love and the ways we figure it out. Hedwig decides to go ahead and fake a passport and get a sex-change in order to leave Germany (also, in the throes of love -- it's complicated). But, the operation doesn't go as planned. "My sex change operation got botched -- my guardian angel fell asleep on the watch," Hedwig sings. "Now, all I got is a Barbie doll crotch -- I've got an angry inch!" </p>
        <p>Hedwig moves to the states, Luther eventually leaves, the wall goes down. This is Hedwig's luck. But, as does any rock and roller Hedwig moves on and starts performing original songs in a coffee house.  To make ends meet, Hedwig takes on baby-sitting gigs and meets the teenaged pastor's son Tommy Speck. This is when the real rock and roll, the sex, the lies, the stealing, amps up. Cue: strobe lights.  </p>

<p>In college I must have watched the movie version of <em>Hedwig </em> -- starring and directed and text (he did a lot) by John Cameron Mitchell -- about a hundred times. With music and lyrics by Stephen Trask, the show's songs are genius, my favorites <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zU3U7E1Odc">"Origin of Love,"</a> "Wig in a Box," and "Exquisite Corpse." As a stage show, Hedwig utilizes a simple set of exposed brick wall with just Hedwig's band "The Angry Inch" -- Kory Danielson, Nicholas Davio, Eric Engelson, and Zachary Moore. We are in any bar in America listening to Hedwig, an expert story-teller. The show centers on Lanning's voice and ability to interact with the crowd. Lanning's performance was everything it needed to be. Hedwig's story is a mixture of aggression and tenderness and Lanning's voice gives the emotion these beautiful songs call for.</p>

<p>The only other person to have any major singing opportunities (Hedwig is a rock star after all) is Hedwig's lover/it's complicated/husband Yitzhak (played by Lauren Paris), who gives a really killer performance as well. Directed by Kyle Trent, the whole show is impressive, because only a really confident and cool team could pull off this show without being heavy handed. </p>

<p>If you don't have all the song lyrics memorized (like I do), it might get a little confusing --  toward the end the music drowned out the singing in a few places. But, that's rock for you -- it's only good if it gets a little loud and messy. During the show's final song, I got goose bumps. The whole crowd put their hands up. We had a moment. </p>

<p>Go see <em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em> if you want your life to be change. Or, if you just want to see a kick-ass show. </p>

<p><em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em> plays on Fridays and Saturdays at 10:30 PM and Sundays at 6 PM through August 5 at Theater Wit, 1229 W Belmont, Chicago IL 60657. General Admissions tickets are $32, students (with ID) and senior (65+) tickets are $20.

<p>I wasn't much of a fan of the first <em>RED</em> film about middle-aged/over-the-hill former CIA operatives (mostly assassins) who are forced out of retirement to take on both the agency and other assorted bad guys. The primary reason I disliked the film is that, with the exception of Morgan Freeman's character and maybe Helen Mirren, none of the retirees were that old. But as the film went on, the truly aggravating parts of the film involved Bruce Willis' harpy, would-be girlfriend Sarah, played by Mary-Louise Parker. Thankfully, the makers of <em>RED 2</em> have seen fit to dial up the action quite a bit (a good thing), introduce more interesting characters in the form of Anthony Hopkins and South Korean superstar Byung-hum Lee (also good things), and made Sarah the single most annoying character to have populated a film this year.</p>

<p>But even more irritating is that once again in a mindless action film, the fate of the free world is at stake and people are trying to save friends and loved ones rather than concentrate on, I don't know, saving the planet. Maybe I'm cold blooded, and I apologize if you are someone who is close to me, but if it comes down to saving you or saving the world, kiss your ass good-bye. The needs of the many and all that shit...</p>
        <p>But my God, I didn't think this franchise could make Sarah more grating. All she wants to do is go out on missions with her sweetie bear Frank (Willis), but when he does include her, all she does is fuck up and put lives at risk. I guess that's funny, but any self-respecting assassin would have done away with her years ago. She's a horrible creature, and Parker adds that extra layer of nails on a chalkboard to really seal the deal. But she's not the only terrible thing about <em>RED 2</em>, oh no.</p>

<p>Seriously, if this series was only about Frank, his buddy Marvin (John Malkovich, acting weird even for him), and maybe Helen Mirren's Victoria (for class), it might be really interesting. But Frank saddled with domestic prospects just isn't as funny as the filmmakers think it is. Tossing in Byung-hun's Han Cho Bai is a great touch; he's agile, funny and adds some energy to the proceedings. I'm always a fan of seeing Neal McDonough in anything; here, he pops up as Jack Horton, who is tracking down a nuclear device that was apparently brought into Moscow from the US piece by piece during the Cold War, assembled, but never used. I'm not sure how killing these former CIA agents fits into his plan, but I'll go along since the film also has a nice extended cameo from David Thewlis as The Frog, who also serves as one of the pieces to this over-complicated puzzle.</p>

<p>All roads seem to lead to Bailey (Hopkins), a scientist who has been locked away for 30-plus years and seems to have lost in mind during that time. But he's the only one who apparently knows where the bomb is hidden, so the team must drag another goofball into its unfunny adventures. I'll admit, I held out some amount of hope for this film because it was directed by <em>Galaxy Quest</em> helmer Dean Parisot, but my optimism was misplaced. Adding to the obnoxious factor is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Russian agent who used to have a little lust thing going on with Frank. And guess how Sarah reacts to that bit of news. Or should I say, guess how she overreacts? God, she's annoying.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of CG-assisted action in <em>RED 2</em>, only Mirren and Malkovich don't utterly humiliate themselves during the course of this film. The laughs are almost entirely low brow, and by the end of this agonizing film, I was kind of hoping the portable nuclear device would get set of, if only to put me out of my fucking misery. But even with all of this being said, I found this film more enjoyable than the last boring, stupid entry. You may be able to glean that I'm not a fan of the <em>RED</em> movies. I'm certainly a fan of most of the actors involved, and I like the idea in principle, but the execution makes me hate the world. I've never read the DC comic this series is based on, but I'm guessing it's a lot more tolerable than these sloppy, dumb movies. If you choose to see this instead of the 15 better movies out there (both in wide and limited release), you're either old or you hate movies; the choice is yours.</p>

<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>Why has no one turned the paranormal investigations of Ed and Lorraine Warren into a television series, preferably on cable, so things can get really scary if they need to (for whatever weird reason, <em>The Conjuring</em> is R rated, just for being that scary, I suppose since there's no blood, nudity, swearing, drug use or even smoking)? This couple went into the Amityville house, and they were (Ed died some years ago) considered the nation's pre-eminent folks in their field for decades. Usually they were disproving or debunking an occurrence, but every so often, they'd hit upon something unexplained that only they were qualified to investigate and deal with. <em>The Conjuring</em> is an account of one such case, and it will likely be the most scared you will be in a movie theater this year.</p>

<p>The Warrens were called to visit a house in Harrisville, RI, recently purchased at auction (so the details of the home's past were not revealed to the buyers) by the Perron family, consisting of father Roger (Ron Livingston), mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor, reminding us what an acting goddess she is), and their four daughters. The symptoms of a troubled house come, at first, in the form of moving objects, doors opening and closing, strange noises, even a few blurry sightings in mirrors. Screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes do a nice job building suspense rather than tossing the big scares at us right off the bat; true modern horror master, director James Wan (the original <em>Saw</em>, <em>Insidious</em>, <em>Dead Silence</em>), quite simply has his pulse on what makes people scared, and he rarely uses cheap tricks to make us squirm in anticipation or jump out of our seats.</p>

<p>Outside of its smart script, the real key to the success of <em>The Conjuring</em> is this great group of actors, including Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the Warrens, who live with their young daughter Judy (Sterling Jerins) in a house that includes a room devoted to possessed or otherwise creepy trinkets from all of their cases, including the notorious Annabelle doll (a Raggedy Ann doll in real life, but not in this film), which is said to be possessed and unnecessarily factors into this story. Taylor's performance as the devoted mother Carolyn is so good in this film, especially as a particularly nasty force that haunts her house (one of many ghosts in the dwelling, but the only one that is dangerous) slowly begins to corrupt her. There are times when Taylor is called upon to unleash in a way I've never seen her do, and she's so convincing that it genuinely freaked me out.</p>

<p>I was also quite moved by Farmiga's take on the spiritually tuned-in Lorraine, whose most recent encounter with a possessed person left her somewhat fragile and damaged; Ed is a constant protective force in her life, and barely allows her to take part in the Perron's once they figure out what they're dealing with. But the Warrens are good, God-fearing people who understand that they must use their abilities to help others the same way they themselves would want to be helped if the tables were turned.</p>

<p>Through good old-fashioned library research, the Warrens unlock the events that took place in the Perron home since the 1800s that have led to these spiritual issues. As ghostly and frightening as things might get, <em>The Conjuring</em> attempts to stay low key and practical when it comes to the way the hauntings manifest themselves. Director Wan knows that the more rooted in reality the scares are, the more we'll have trouble sleeping at home that night; what a bastard. And for the record, Wan will make you petrified to walk into your unfinished basement for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Much like his last film <em>Insidious</em>, <em>The Conjuring</em> isn't just a solid scare movie; it's a genuinely fine film in any genre. And the power of great actors adds a layer of heart and empathy to the characters that actually makes us care about what happens to these poor people. Why don't more people who make horror films get that? Having your lead characters be simply young and good looking isn't enough; usually characters like that are portrayed as assholes, and we root for them to die, thus eliminating almost all of the suspense from the equation. But when we like and feel for the characters, we see ourselves in their situation and how horrible it would be to have our lives derailed in such a way. It ups the ante, and gives us so much to be scared about. I hope now that Wan is moving on to direct the next chapter in the <em>Fast & Furious</em> series, he doesn't leave horror behind him just when he's getting so damn consistent. So if you don't have an aversion to being scared, <em>The Conjuring</em> is your only choice this weekend.</p>

<h3>Fruitvale Station</h3>
<p>The first thought I had when I watched <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, the remarkable work from first-time writer-director Ryan Coogler, had nothing to do with racial equality, social injustice or even the case against George Zimmerman. Certainly, thoughts revolving around all of those subject eventually worked their way into my mind, but the very first one that continues to plague me today has to do with death. This account of the last 24 hours in Oscar Grant's 22-year life reminded me that we never wake up knowing that a particular day is the day we're going to die (unless we're on Death Row, I guess). </p>

<p>Coogler doesn't load up Grant's final day on Earth &mdash; the first day of 2009 &mdash; with significant moments and prophetic events. There are a few eerie hints as to what may happen that day, but none of them are specifically about death at the hands of an over-eager Bay Area transit cop. Coogler does open his film with the real-life grainy cell phone video of Grant's murder at the BART Fruitvale station, but knowing what's coming does not in any way undercut the low-level tension that seeps into every frame of the movie.</p>

<p>The filmmaker makes no attempt to paint Grant (played by the remarkable young actor Michael B. Jordan) as a man without flaws &mdash; quite the contrary. Oscar has just recently gotten out of jail, he's lost his job for being late every day, and he's still dealing pot to make ends meet for himself, his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) and young daughter, Tatiana (Ariana Neal). Sophina recently found out Oscar was cheating on her, so we can add that to the list of Oscar's many bad deeds. But in the plus column, he is trying to get his life back on track and stop dealing drugs. He still has a hair-trigger temper, but with the help of those closest to him, especially his mother (recent Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer), he's even learning to reel that in somewhat.</p>

<p>The one time <em>Fruitvale Station</em> strays from its 24-hour timeframe is a brief flashback to one year ago when Grant was in jail, and his mother comes to visit him. The scene is there to set up a confrontation later in the film, but what it really does is show you how far Oscar and his mother have come in just one year. In the jailhouse sequence, Oscar accuses his mother of never having his back, a statement that seems utterly false, but that doesn't make it hurt any less. It's a relatively short scene, but the amount of information that we gain from it immeasurable and devastating.</p>

<p>Coogler's mission is not to attach any kind of special status to Grant's life; to him every life is equally important. His goal seems to be putting a face to the name, attaching specifics to a young black man who might have otherwise been a statistic were it not for the brazen nature of his killing and the photographic evidence of the crime. The filmmakers is keenly aware that when white faces are killed so maliciously, that is big news, politicians step forward and calls for gun control and "Stop the Violence" soon follow. But when it's a black victim from the wrong side of the tracks, the death is added to a tally for the year, and people move on. </p>

<p>That's the true message of <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, a film that is as important, relevant and vital as any that will be released this year and likely this decade. Coogler doesn't stand on a soapbox and declare his message. He simply allows the well-documented events to play out, and puts a face to the bullet. It's a painful, necessary work to watch, but Jordan gives us a performance that marks not only a turning point in his acting career but also paints a complete portrait of a man trying to do better, sometimes succeeding, other times failing &mdash; like all of us. I know many of you will read about this film and decide "Not for me," and you'd be wrong. <em>Fruitvale Station</em> is for all of us, because it's about all of us.</p>

<h3>Turbo</h3>
<p>The latest film from Dreamworks Animation might come the closest to the attention to detail that Pixar is typically identified with, but with the added bonus of embracing the concept of taking creatures that most would consider unappealing and making them funny and charming to a wide audience. The creatures in question are snails, and the film is <em>Turbo</em>, from first-time feature director David Soren, whose previous works include a couple of <em>Madagascar</em> shorts and television specials. Of course, some might not consider the practice of injecting said snails into the world of Indy car racing a huge risk.</p>

<p>The film follows a group of garden-variety snails (literally &mdash; they live in a vegetable garden) that includes Theo (voiced quite nicely by Ryan Reynolds), a snail who loves watching Indy car racing and dreams of himself in the drivers seat on day, and his more practical brother Chet (Paul Giamatti), who simply wants the two to perform their snaily duties and not get in trouble doing it. These duties seem to consist of grabbing rotten fruit from the vines and either eating it or depositing it in a place where the snails can compost it. A freak accident involving lightning supercharges and tricks out Theo's shell, but more importantly, it gives him the ability to live his dream of being super fast. What are the odds?!</p>

<p>Partly by design and partly by accident, Theo finds himself miles away from his garden home and ends up being discovered by a pair of taco truck owners, Tito and Angelo (Michael Peña and Luis Guzman), who just happen to race snails (usually the slower variety), but when Theo shows them what he's got, Tito sees his new friend (who renames himself Turbo) as his taco business' ticket to fame. Again by complete coincidence, Turbo meets a group of like-minded wanna-be racing snails, including ones voiced by Samuel L. Jackson, Maya Rudolph, Ben Schwartz, Snoop Dogg and Michelle Rodriguez.</p>

<p>And through a series of contrivances and rule technicalities that could only happen or be legal in the world of a kid-friendly offering like <em>Turbo</em>, the young snail ends up racing in the Indianapolis 500 (much to my chagrin, Turbo does not drive a car; he just uses his super-charged shell to propel him at more or less the exact speed as his fellow racers). When you add voice actors like Bill Hader (as driver Guy Gagne, Turbo's primary human competition), Richard Jenkins and Ken Jeong, the one thing you can't say about <em>Turbo</em> is that it lacks a talented cast, all of whom have the right level of energy and skill to keep things moving and engaging.</p>

<p>While some may dismiss <em>Turbo</em> as simply a movie for kids, I think there are some really interesting lessons and themes happening that parents and other adults will appreciate. I love the way the two sets of brothers (the snails and the humans) are divided into one who is a dreamer and another who is more practical, and the way the dreamers help each other realize their ambitions is a great story of cooperation and friendship. Peña and Guzman are particularly funny, even if their being cast as taco salesmen treads dangerously close to stereotyping. The actors playing the snail racing group are really enjoyable too, and I was especially surprised how great Rodriguez was at voice work. People like Hader, Schwartz or Jeong seem like they'd be naturals at this kind of work, but Rodriguez is expressive and impressive as well.</p>

<p>As for the animation itself, there are times during the racing sequences when the photorealism of the track and cars is mind-blowing. Of course, I thought the same thing about <em>Cars</em> seven years ago, but just because you've seen something once doesn't mean it can't floor you a second time. The nature of the race is so outlandish that you'll either find it too ridiculous, or you'll give yourself over to the goofy circumstances and just enjoy the hell out of the race and subsequent accidents.</p>

<p>The scenes I found the most contrived and forced were the ones with Theo and Chet bickering. Theo behaves like a ADD-addled child, simply doing what he wants and blowing off his important role in his community. Meanwhile, Chet is so buttoned down and controlling, why wouldn't Theo rebel? Their squabbling gets old fast, and it's really only in the first 15-20 minutes of the film. I cheered when Theo bolted for freedom and set out on his own, whether he meant to or not.</p>

<p>Still, <em>Turbo</em> is a real easy film to settle into. It breaks just enough new ground to keep you interested, but it certainly takes advantage of some tried-and-true formulaic elements as well, both in terms of its story and animated technical achievements. It helps that about half of the film is taking place at a couple hundred miles per hour, so it actually feels like things are going somewhere. But like a real Indy car race, <em>Turbo</em> never quite lets you forget that it's covering familiar ground each time around. I liked it enough to recommend, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it any time soon.</p>

<h3>Girl Most Likely</h3>
<p>With the exception of their adaptation of <em>American Splendor</em>, co-directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcici's films all have something in common: they're all just okay. Take a look at more recent works like <em>The Nanny Diaries</em> or <em>The Extra Man</em>, and you'll certainly find elements, scenes, fragments to enjoy. But more than likely, you'll come away from them feeling something important is lacking, and that something is greatness. Sadly, the latest offering from Kristen Wiig, <em>Girl Most Likely</em> (from a screenplay by Michelle Morgan), easily slips into that template of falling short of greatness as well, and what we're left with is an abrasive work front-loaded with characters that are simply too pathetic or like being assholes too much to enjoy anything about it.</p>

<p>A failed playwright before she even wrote her first play, Imogene Duncan (Wiig) was a younger woman full of promise, but nothing in her upbringing prepared her to be good at anything. She and her socially messed up brother Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald) were told their father died when they were young, and their irresponsible, gambling-addicted mother (Annette Bening) is a special kind of trampy. When her rich boyfriend dumps her for a younger model (literally and figuratively), she fakes a suicide attempt, which includes what is apparently a very well-written suicide note that convinces psychiatric doctors that she needs to be under constant care for at least a few days, forcing her to move from her New York apartment to her mom's house in New Jersey. Ick!</p>

<p>Mom is living with her boyfriend George (aka The Bousche, played by Matt Dillon), who says he's a spy for the CIA, as most spies will tell you. This, of course, explains his long absences from the household... because he's traveling... on secret missions. Stick with me; this might turn out to be true. Also currently occupying Imogene's childhood room is a renter named Lee (Darren Criss from "Glee"), a singer in a Backstreet Boys cover band, part of a casino's '90s retrospective show.</p>

<p>The film bounces around quite a bit, and unwisely decides to take care of everybody's problems at the same time rather than just focus on one person's life and construct something realistic in the process. Imogene is now looked upon as an unstable force in her snobby friends' lives, and for whatever reason, she wants back in. Brother Ralph is afraid to leave the confines of their boardwalk community and even more terrified of talking to a girl he likes (Natasha Lyonne) without his sister's help. Mom's life is still a mess; Lee wants to be a real singer; the only thing missing is a heart for the Tin Man. Actually, the brother is so scared of the world, he's actually built a human-sized hermit crab shell that he can crawl into when things around him get scary. This movie doesn't know the meaning of the word "subtlety."</p>

<p>This is that version of Wiig who is mousy, timid and unsure of herself. It's not that far removed from who she played in Bridesmaids, but just a little more unhinged. Someone tried to convince me that she wasn't that crazy, to which I countered, "Yes, but how crazy do you have to be to think a suicide attempt is going to get somebody back?" <em>Girl Most Likely</em> has some funny and even a few moving small moments. If the film had focused more on Imogene trying to recapture some of her lost potential as a writer, I might have been on board. Instead, the filmmakers resort to cheap laughs and one humiliating moment after another.</p>

<p>When Imogene attempts to reinsert herself back into her old group of friends, the results are catastrophic. But we should be more on her side in that moment, and we simply aren't because a blindfolded person could have seen that coming. I'd kind of like to meet the person who is genuinely enthusiastic about <em>Girl Most Likely</em>, because even if you like it, I find it really tough to believe you'd recommend it to anyone. It's not bad; it's just okay, bordering on pointless.</p>

<h3>Only God Forgives</h3>
<p>I'm not typically at a loss for words after watching any movie, but I'll whole-heartedly admit that I sat kind of stunned for a few minutes after watching the latest from writer-director Nicolas Winding Refn (the <em>Pusher</em> trilogy, <em>Bronson</em>), who has re-teamed with his <em>Drive</em> lead actor Ryan Gosling for a very different style of film in <em>Only God Forgives</em>. Set in the only part of Bangkok I'm familiar with &mdash; the underbelly &mdash; the story is a complicated tale of revenge, in which we feel pretty sure no one is going to come out at the end better than they were at the start.</p>

<p>Gosling plays Julian, a drug kingpin and boxing promoter who doesn't speak much but has a lasting connection with a local prostitute whom he doesn't even have sex with, if we can believe what we see here, and I think it's safe to say not everything we see on the screen is meant to be real. When Julian's brother, Billy (Tom Burke), rapes and murders a 16-year-old girl, the girl's father exacts his revenge at the urging of a local gangster. Before long, Julian begins his quest to exact the most brutal kind of revenge on the men who murdered and ordered the murder of his brother, and he does so at the urging of his ruthless viper of a mother, Crystal (a blanched-out, absolutely brilliant Kristen Scott Thomas).</p>

<p>Then there's a measured, mesmerizing and violent-as-all-hell police detective named Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), who seems to prefer staring over showing any emotion. In fact, the film seems to specialize in characters who like to stare as they are bathed in red or blue or gold light. There's no getting around that the <em>Only God Forgives</em> is a visually stunning exercise, but I'm not sure it really goes anywhere as a narrative or an acting endeavor. I don't need a film to have a straight-ahead, sensible story, nor do I have to like any or all of the characters, but I need something to latch onto and help me find an entry point into what's happening. Refn really hasn't given us that. I admired the rhythm of the piece as it goes from meditative to violently explosive in the blink of an eye. Body parts are lopped off, entrails are dumped on the floor, and spilt blood is like currency to these people.</p>

<p><em>Only God Forgives</em> is never boring, and I'll give it a great deal of credit for that. But I never really cared what happened to these stagnant characters, which is not the same as saying I didn't enjoy seeing where they took me. I have decidedly mixed feelings about this one; it's clearly a case where style won out over substance, which makes it tough to just flat-out recommend, but there are elements you might be intrigued enough by to carry you to the end with a somewhat satisfied feeling. The film opens today in Chicago at the Music Box Theatre.</p>

<h3>Crystal Fairy</h3>
<p>I bet the story behind how this movie got made is almost as interesting as the film itself, and I happened to think <em>Crystal Fairy</em> is an great little movie. This Chilean production from writer-director Sebastián Silva follows the bizarre journey of an American tourist Jamie (Michael Cera) who wants to road trip to San Pedro to track down a specific type of cactus (coincidentally called the San Pedro cactus), who can be turned into a tea and becomes a powerful hallucinogen that opens up your soul and makes you realize all sorts of shit about yourself and blah blah blah. The stuff gets you high; that's all you need to know.</p>

<p>The night before Jamie and three local brothers (all played by the director's actual siblings, Agustin, José Miguel and Juan Andrés Silva) hit the road, the American gets stoned at a party and invites a wild girl named Crystal Fairy (Gaby Hoffmann), who's a bit of a flake, but Jamie thinks she might sleep with him. By the next morning, he's basically forgotten her, but she calls him and ends up on the trip, much to Jamie's annoyance.</p>

<p>Like most road films, the important stuff is in the journey not in getting to a beautiful beach and getting stoned. When the group finally makes it to San Pedro, the pains they must go through to get even a small chunk of cactus is hilarious and entertaining. The guys soon find out that Crystal Fairy has very few inhibitions and tends to be very cool getting fully naked in front of them, and it's about the least sexual thing for any of the parties involved. As he did with more outrageous results in <em>This Is the End</em>, Cera once again taps into his inner ugly American as he endlessly tries to stick to a schedule he set up and get furious when things delay their trip.</p>

<p>But as the film progresses, <em>Crystal Fairy</em>'s appeal and unbridled kindness begin to have their effect on Jamie and the rest of the group, and by the time they've reached their destination beach with cactus in tow, the true nature of all five characters begins to take hold as secrets are spilled and judging each other is set aside. <em>Crystal Fairy</em> is a surprisingly moving examination of this fledgling friendship in this far-away location, which is as much of a character in this film as any of the actors. It's also a beautiful film, and it's no surprise that it won the Best Director Award-World Cinema at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The shifts in <em>Crystal Fairy</em> are small and subtle, but the results take it from being a silly, lightweight road trip movie into something more substantial and emotionally powerful. The film opens today in Chicago at the Music Box Theatre.</p>

<h3>Terms and Conditions May Apply</h3>
<p>I've decided there are three types of documentaries: those that are informative or educational, such as biographies or works about movements or trends in the world; those that are a call to action, often focusing on a political or social movement that threatens our very way of living; and those that simply make us paranoid. Now, of course, there are more types of docs in the world, and there's no reason a single film can't incorporate more than one of these styles. Case in point, the fantastic, eye-opening work from director Cullen Hoback <em>Terms and Conditions May Apply</em>, which examines what exactly we're agreeing to when we click that little "Agree" button on iTunes, Facebook, Twitter, an email provider or whatever other internet service agreements we blindly enter into on a regular basis.</p>

<p>In the bigger picture, the film is about the rapid decline of true privacy in the world and how Terms of Privacy statements basically all say that your information will remain private unless someone (the service provider, the government, etc.) decides it won't any longer. If you believe the film, one of the biggest forces in the desire for less privacy is Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg, who seems particularly perturbed when his privacy is invaded but has no trouble making the default privacy settings on Facebook offer the public outside of your chosen "friends" have access to your Facebook pages, photos and information.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, 9/11 was a big turning point in privacy rules and electronic surveillance changes. As we now all know, the government is monitoring phone calls, emails, texts &mdash; any type of communication that you likely think is personal. According to the filmmaker and those he interviews, things in this arena have actually gotten worse since President Obama took office. Indeed, after <em>Terms and Conditions</em> makes us insanely paranoid, it becomes a call to action and give options about where things should/might go from here. While there are those in government who believe that if you're not doing anything wrong, these gaps in privacy shouldn't bother you, that isn't really the issue. In fact, the government doesn't even make a good case that we're safer as a result of this intrusions. It's a film that should spark much discussion and debate; it does what a good doc should always do, which is stay with us long after the film is over.</p>

<p><em>Terms and Conditions May Apply</em> will screen at the Gene Siskel Film Center on Saturday, July 20 at 5:30pm, and Tuesday, July 23 at 8pm. Director Cullen Hoback will be present for a Q&A after the Tuesday screening.</p>

        <p> <em>Mahal</em> is a family story. A Filipino family with strong roots in the Philippines adjusts to life, love and loss in its new country. The family members (the father, two sons and a daughter) are each recovering in their own way from the recent death of the mother. Some family members even call the mother's phone number to hear her voicemail greeting, and leave messages for her until the mailbox fills up.) Danny Bernardo, Bailiwick resident playwright, is the author of this world premiere. Director Erica Weiss was director and co-creator of <em>A Twist of Water</em>, a recent hit for Route 66 Theatre Company.</p>

<p>"Mahal" means "love," and the way family members express or withhold love is the root of this story. The Reyes family has retained many aspects of their Filipino culture--greetings, language and cuisine, of course. It's amazing how for people from all ethnicities and nationalities, many family memories revolve around food.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="http://gapersblock.com/ac/Mahal-GB.jpg"><img alt="Mahal-GB.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/assets_c/2013/07/Mahal-GB-thumb-500x317-12417.jpg" width="570" height="317" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a><br /><span class="s"><small>Bailiwick Chicago's <em>Mahal</em>; photo: Michael Brosilow.</small></span></p>

        <p></p>

<p>The adult children greet their father, Roberto (Joseph Foronda), with a traditional hand kiss. There's a thread to this story for each family member.</p>

<p>The oldest sibling, Mari (Kate Garassino), tries to hold the family together and maintain the weekly family dinner tradition that their mother wished them to observe. Older brother Jun (Karmann Bajuyo) expects his brother Mikey (Kevin Reyes) to show him the respect that an older brother would receive in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Mikey, the family rebel and the only sibling born in the US, resists some aspects of the Filipino culture and has not come to grips with his mother's death. He meets and begins a relationship with Tim (Patrick Byrnes), a graduate student working on a PhD in Asian studies. Tim, who has at least an academic understanding of the Asian and Filipino culture, wants to help Mikey deal with family changes.</p>

<p>Roberto tries to make a new life for himself after his wife's death, even redecorating the family home with the help of Kendall (Blair Robertson), a young interior designer with whom he develops more than a professional relationship.</p>

<p>Relationships begin to be more tangled when Jun arranges for his friend Kim (Jillian Jocson) to come to the US with the expectation that they will continue their romance; however, when she meets his other family members, an explosive situation results that changes family dynamics.</p>

<p>The two-hour play is set in one of Stage 773's three performance spaces. Stephen Carmody's design makes the most of the tiny stage with changes from family home to apartment, to bar to restaurant, then to O'Hare Field, with quick scene changes and a movable back wall. Cast members roll in new set devices (bars, tables, shelf units) for their scenes.</p>

<p>The family relationships and dialogue seem heartfelt and very believable, and the acting is generally good. Veteran Chicago actor Foronda is especially strong as the father trying to retain his familial role and still make a future for himself. Weiss keeps the short scenes moving along briskly.</p>

<p>My one criticism is there is a little too much <a href="http://tagaloglang.com/">Tagalog</a>, especially during the explosive family scene in act two--not for some members of the audience, who obviously understood every word, but for several minutes, anyone who did not know the language was probably looking for subtitles. The implications of the angry scene become clear later, but it was temporarily mystifying.</p>

<p>Props to Bailiwick for showcasing a Filipino story--and celebrating the presence of some 130,000 Filipino-Americans who live in the Chicago area.</p>

        <p>Before footworking, percolating, and jukin' became popular, there was steppin'--the smooth--and sometimes, slick and acrobatic--dance style that has been a major part of Chicago's dance culture for decades.</p>

<p>Steppin' is extremely synonymous with Chicago, especially among those of a particular age group; in fact, it is such a part of the fabric of the city's culture that much has been devoted to it, including competitions, balls, television shows, music, and fashion, not to mention you can't go anywhere on the south or west sides without a club having a night dedicated to it. Even the 1997 cult classic film <em>Love Jones</em> (filmed here), which starred Chicago native Larenz Tate, featured an entire scene about steppin'. </p>
        <p>While some will inevitably credit R. Kelly with keeping steppin' alive by introducing the art form to the mainstream and re-popularizing it via his chart-topping 2003 hit, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj71KbE6ekg">"Step In the Name of Love [Remix],"</a> those immersed in the steppin' scene will more than likely give that honor to legendary Chicago DJ and Radio Hall of Fame inductee, <a href="http://www.v103.com/pages/herb.html">Herb Kent</a>, who, in addition to keeping steppers' music in heavy rotation every week on V103 (102.7 FM), once hosted "Steppin' at Club 7," a local show that aired in the 90s on ABC7-Chicago.</p>

<p>To celebrate the cultural significance of steppin', this summer, both seasoned steppers and interested observers can attend the DuSable Museum of African-American History's <a href="http://www.dusablemuseum.org/events/details/steppin-under-the-stars">"Steppin' Under the Stars,"</a> a free, monthly dance series featuring the best in steppin' moves and music. The first event, hosted by Kent, will take place this Friday, July 19; the remaining dates are Friday, Aug. 16 and Friday, Sept. 20--all events are from 6pm-9pm.

        <p>Some things about <em>The Casuals</em> might make you uncomfortable--nuclear testing, for instance. Government agencies that hide the truth (and insist you don't ask questions). Stories that may be lies or truth. A mother who tells her son how his father died a hero.  An uncle who tells his nephew's wife how his brother really died.</p>

<p><em>The Casuals</em>, set in 1955 Nevada, is a new play presented by Jackalope Theatre Company. The script is by Chance Bone and Andrew Burden Swanson, with direction by Jonathan Berry. </p>

<p>Several stories are entwined in this two-hour drama. Richard "Rich" Hughes (Ed Dzialo), a veteran and former military radio host, deals with an unexpected visit from his nephew Tom (Morgan Maher), who stops with his new wife, Jessica (Ellie Reed) while on their honeymoon road trip. Rich also has a warm connection with a widow, Lucille (Somer Benson) and her 12-year-old son. Lucille's late husband Les (Brad Smith) has a mysterious connection with Rich's past.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="http://gapersblock.com/ac/TheCasuals-GB.jpg"><img alt="TheCasuals-GB.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/assets_c/2013/07/TheCasuals-GB-thumb-560x356-12440.jpg" width="560" height="356" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a><br /><span class="s"><small>Sam Kurzydlo, Ellie Reed, Morgan Maher & Ed Dzialo; photo by Alex Hand.</small></span></p>
        <p>Dennis, (Rich's brother and Tom's father), died in the war, leaving Rich to raise Tom. The family story is that Dennis died a hero and saved the lives of his fellow soldiers, but Tom is intensely uncomfortable with any mention of his father. Rich keeps old tapes, a reel-to-reel recorder and other memorabilia, including Dennis' uniform, in his attic. </p>

<p>We see Rich in his post-war job interviewing candidates for a secret government program. He has a script to follow and is told not to deviate from it. Les, the first interviewee, has health problems, but he says he can't talk about them and Rich is not supposed to take the questioning any further. We learn later that Les' son Tim has a serious illness, too. Did his father die a hero, as his mother says, or was he part of an atomic research program testing reactions of already sick participants? In the '50s, we trusted our government to always do the right thing for its citizens; today, we've lost that naïveté about our government, but we still trust our loved ones to tell us the truth.</p>

<p>The threat of nuclear disaster hangs over the play. In 1955, we didn't know we should be afraid. "Let's go watch the test this afternoon," says Rich, and everyone goes to a viewing site to wait for the powerful explosion and brilliant flash of light, all  protected by goggles. We know that the young woman is pregnant, yet we trust the government carrying out the test. "What happens to the ash?" Tom asks. "Oh, the heavy stuff disperses into the clouds and blows away," Rich replies.</p>

<p>Some things about the play itself are a little mysterious. Time settings are ambiguous and are not defined in the playbill. The significance of the play's title is never suggested. What does "The Casuals" mean? Usually when a play has a symbolic title, a hint of meaning will be mentioned in dialogue.</p>

<p>The acting is strong throughout the play; however, while Berry's directing is smooth, unfortunately, it can't overcome some of the bumpy spots in the script itself.</p>

<p>Fans and students of comedy will tell you that while Mooney wrote for classic 70s sitcoms like "Sanford and Son" and "Good Times," he is best known for his <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/121640-richard-pryors-designated-writer-an-interview-with-paul-mooney/">close ties</a> to the late Richard Pryor, which has resulted, in some circles, with him being hailed as "the man <em>behind</em> the man." In the early days and during the peak of Pryor's career, Mooney wrote (or co-wrote) a lot of his television and big screen material, including the short-lived "The Richard Pryor Show," his classic "Saturday Night Live" appearance,  <em>JoJo Dancer Your Life is Calling</em>, and much more. </p>
        <p>In addition to his work with Pryor, Mooney continued to write, eventually ushering in his brand of humor for the "new school," with hilarious sketch comedy characters and skits including "In Living Color" (he created the popular 'Homey D. Clown' character) and "Chappelle's Show."    </p>

<p>This weekend, Mooney brings his stand-up tour, "Paul Mooney: Black Man in the White House," to Chicago's <a href="http://www.broadwayinbronzeville.com/">Harold Washington Cultural Center</a>, 4701 S. King Drive, located in the heart of the city's Bronzeville neighborhood.</p>

<p>Though he is brazen, indeed, Mooney has sustained a long and successful career in comedy by doing things his way, especially if the topic is race in America; and when onstage, he's not necessarily anecdotal or animated, never bites his tongue, and he is <em>always</em> brutally honest. The title of his tour, obviously, suggests conversations--and observations--about President Obama, and given the outcome of the recent George Zimmerman trial, he is sure to go "there," as well. </p>

<p>Catch the one night only performance of "Paul Mooney: Black Man in the White House," Saturday, July 20, for two shows, 7pm and 9pm; tickets are $50-$75 and are available <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=3611804&pl=tobaccoroad">online</a>.

<p>CLA, a member based business organization, commissioned designer and illustrator <a href="http://noahmacmillan.wordpress.com/">Noah MacMillan</a> to create a piece of work that invoked the metropolitan flair of Chicago. MacMillan's creation, "Float," is a colorful illustration of a parade of large, bright sea creatures winding through the streets of downtown.</p>
        <p>MacMillan, based in Saint Louis, uses ink drawing, painting and digital techniques to achieve a bold artistic style that combines elements of street art, printmaking and vintage illustration. His work has been featured on book covers and skateboard decks, and in <em>Smithsonian Magazine </em>and <em>The Washington Post</em>. </p>

<p>The mural is not the CLA's first art initiative. Another includes <a href="http://www.popupartloop.com/index.php">Pop-Up Art Loop</a> which showcases art exhibitions in empty storefronts downtown. These temporary galleries then foster a relationship between the public, artists and property owners.</p>

<p>Be sure to catch the unveiling of "Float" Tues.,  July 16, at Century Building, 202 S. State St.  For more information visit <a href="http://www.chicagoloopalliance.com/">Chicago Loop Alliance</a> or call 312-782-9160.</p>

<p>This weekend, legendary comic <a href="https://twitter.com/attell">Dave Attell</a> performs alongside Chicago native <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyKallas">Danny Kallas</a> at Mayne Stage in Rogers Park. I was able to chat with the stand-up legend and hilarious '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Best-Insomniac-Uncensored-Vol/dp/B000087F5T">Insomniac</a>' Attell; the comedian got nasty as we discussed retro porn, his favorite dirty comics and tips to navigate the entertainment business.</p>
        <p><strong>Hey Dave, thanks for chatting with me. So what are you up to in Chicago?<br />
</strong></p>

<p>No problem. Yes sir, I will be in Chicago this weekend at The Mayne Stage. The guy performing with me is Danny Kallas. I heard he's a big Chicago comic, so I'm excited.</p>

<p><strong>With stand-up, how do you get paired up with comedians?</strong></p>

<p>That's a good question. I always like to use the local guys because it's hard enough to get work and sometimes club work. I'm down that they have their headliners, bring their own guys. I always just try to go with that.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a group mentality with stand-ups working together? Is there encouragement, to wish the other comic well?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah it's always that way. I've been doing it for 26 years and I think its safe to say, after a while, the only people you can relate to are comics because you hang out with them all the time. But as a guy who has been on the road a long time, you only get better with stage time. So, it's good for these new guys coming up to give them some stage time, whether it's a guest spot, opening or middling. You should do it. I think it does help<em> all </em>comedy. There's so many different comics and so many different crowds. I like the crowds in Chicago. They like comedy and that's always a plus. And they really do get it and like to come out to shows.</p>

<p><strong>Do you like to mix it up with different comedy outlets? Or is stand-up your thing?<br />
</strong></p>

<p>I like to do a different show every time. But I'm not an improv actor. I always just try to create my own projects or stand-up specials. Maybe once or twice I'll do some acting things, but I'm not an actor. I 'm happy about that. I wake up every day thanking God I'm not an actor. I realize, when and where I perform, I really just don't give a sh-- anymore. I just like filling the clubs up. I kind of gave up on reviews and things like that. This is kind of a rarity--I usually play comedy clubs. But I heard it's [Mayne Stage] a really good theater, so why not? It will be really fun because I'll work with really funny comics and it will be a totally hardcore show. The crowd will want really dirty humor.</p>

<p><strong>I like how all your shows aren't trying to be edgy. 'Insomniac' was just about things you like...cracking jokes, showing the late night scene and drinking. For your series on Showtime, "<a href="http://vimeo.com/52966710">Dave's Old Porn</a>," did you just pitch the show to them, like, "I just have this box of porn--I'll crack jokes--let's make this happen?"</strong></p>

<p>Well, Stewart Bailey, who is the co-executive producer on "The Daily Show," he and I came up with the idea. I wanted to do a show--just do unscripted jokes with the porn aspect, which is the cool part of it, [and] just getting dirty, talking about dirty stuff. People really like that kind of comedy and really like that kind of porn. People have been coming up to me and saying, "Man, I really love that show." Hopefully, the DVD will get to people that didn't get to see it. It's rare to set your ideas in action and just figure it out. Even though they [Showtime] didn't want to bring it back for a third season, I'm just glad I got to do it like I wanted to do it. </p>

<p><strong>There's definitely no show like it. People don't talk about porn enough...</strong></p>

<p>Oh man, porn is international. Porn is bigger than currency. Comedy and porn are a great match. Every other comic I know is watching porn as much as me, more than me, or they never watch it at all. And that was the fun part, having all these super cool women on the show, like Kathy Griffin, who is an amazing improvisational actress and incredible comic. We had Amy Schumer on, who knows more about porn than anybody. It was cool to have all these different comics and styles. And then we had porn stars from the flicks we were watching come on like Ron Jeremy and Kayden Kross. They're all really, really, cool. It wasn't in any way, some type of judgmental show, it was just all about the fun of it. I think there should be more shows like that, and less judging.</p>

<p><strong>But for the youngins out there, this is like your dad's porn--retro 70s and 80s.<br />
</strong></p>

<p>Exactly. Anybody in these films are either dead or in rehab. </p>

<p><strong>How open-minded have networks been with your ideas for a new show? Is it hard to maintain some creative freedom?</strong></p>

<p>I don't pitch ideas right now. But I would say that for the pitching aspect, never have we lived in a better time but also such a harder time for it. Let's say you're a young guy, and you and your friends maybe want to put out some videos, or maybe get the right people to see it. Good luck, because you know there are millions of other guys, more connected, [who] have more money, or even have more drive than you guys. The good thing is you don't really need a network, but you kind of still do, just to put you on some kind of legitimate platform. Even if you're an internet sensation, whether comedy or some skateboarding videos or something, it just becomes this internet content. And it is there for people who are getting hip to what's going on out there.</p>

<p><strong>When I talk to comedians, it seems that the form of stand-up becomes this core identity of comedy--that they have to return to doing a good stand-up set to get back to who they are as a comic...</strong></p>

<p>That's great that you say that because I don't think of myself as a great stand-up comic. But for me, I'm just the guy trying to put together a new hour. Just put together a great show and I don't want to just do things for money. There are a couple of things that I want to do, TV-wise, while I have a full plate already.</p>

<p><strong>You mentioned this earlier: Do you believe true fans of comedy are the ones who end up at stand-up shows?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, it's awesome when you see the same people come to your first show one night, and then come the next night. I'm like, "Whoa that's awesome!" And then I'll try to do stuff for them because that's amazing, even though the venue probably had a good chicken deal that night. I assume that those are the people that really want to have a good time.</p>

<p><strong>What are you up to in your spare time?</strong></p>

<p>I am constantly editing and stuff, working on the DVD of "Dave's Old Porn," which is a lot more work than I realized, and that process is just me trying to find all these cool moments that might have not made it on the show. Right now, I'm more about getting back to my act, getting back on the road, to get back to the feeling of whoever is coming to see me as a fan of comedy. And I can't thank them enough for that. I just want to get a connection with those people and just get better at comedy. I'm not a great comic--I'm a good comic. And I've been doing it a long time. I want this to be the year that I just really focus on my comedy and not about other things to do. </p>

<p><strong>What comedians are you checking out right now?</strong></p>

<p>The people that make me laugh are some of New York-based guys, who are coming up with really good new material. But I would say the guy who I never get tired of watching is Doug Stanhope. He's definitely the "last of the Mohicans', like, the last of the real hardcore comics. But people I work with like Amy Schumer and Artie Lange--they are all about truth and telling good stories. </p>

<p><strong>Are you known as the "Insomniac" guy?</strong></p>

<p>Now that you said that, yeah, that's what I get most times. I'm for that; it's kind of hard to top anything you do on television because a lot of guys do a TV show than it just sticks. But I'm more of just a comic--just this drinking, hardcore comic--trying to always become better.</p>

<p><strong>But "Insomniac" was a great show. You're known for being you and having a good time late at night. At least you don't have that cheesy, sweater-wearing TV image like Bob Saget.</strong></p>

<p>[Laughs] Oh yeah, Bob. But he always looks good. He's "money-in-the-bank" good.</p>

<p><strong>"Insomniac" just kind of ended. Was it because you couldn't just keep it as spontaneous anymore?</strong></p>

<p>People ask me all the time what happened to that show. We were doing these hour specials in different countries across the world. I guess the network wasn't feeling it. I was just happy that people liked it. And I guess it wasn't as popular then as it is now. I'm glad that I stopped. I think people keep bringing it up because they kind of grew up with it. At the end of the day, I really felt like everything we did was good and the people who worked on it were amazing. But if we kept going, we would just keep repeating ourselves more and have to set things up.</p>

<p><strong>I think of "Insomniac," like I do "Chappelle's Show," which could have probably had a few more good seasons left, but you guys didn't want the show to get cheesy, it had a good run, it was what it was, and it's time to move on...</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, right, Dave's another guy who is just a great comic. I think that whole thing overshadowed how great a comic he is. Now it seems I'm going that way. But people need to do what they feel and that can become a very tough thing to do. The guy [Chapelle] loves comedy. If you've seen him live, that's a testimony to that.</p>

<p><strong>Anything else?</strong></p>

<p>Just getting the DVD of "Dave's Old Porn" together which will be real cool. And you and rest of Chicago should come out to the show this weekend. It will be two nights Friday and Saturday and it won't be sold out, so don't worry.</p>

<p><strong>Perfect. That's my kind of show...</strong></p>

<p>[Laughs] Exactly. It's an old man's struggle.</p>

<p>In the weeks leading up to the release of <em>Pacific Rim</em>, I've been rewatching the films of director/co-writer Guillermo del Toro in order. And just for the hell of it, I've been watching the "making of" extras as well, just because for many of them I never did previously. What I was reminded of through this process is that Del Toro is an obsessive fan of practical effects. This isn't a big secret, but often he went practical because of a combination of budgetary constraints and him liking the weight and texture of the "realness."</p>

<p>I've known since the first trailers of <em>Pacific Rim</em> that the showcased Kaiju (the giant monsters that are being released from a wormhole-like portal deep at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean) and Jaegers (the human-made army of human-controlled, 250-foot-tall mech warriors that are built to defend the Pacific coastlines of North America and Asia primarily) were not going to be practical and nature, and I was willing to accept that this was Del Toro working on a scale he had never experienced before. My concern was that the emotional context that he so wonderfully maintains in all of his works would be lost at this scale. It wasn't that I had lost faith in his abilities, but scale sometimes triumphs over the most heartfelt of intentions.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest things we are told about the operation of the Jaegers is that they require two pilots whose minds and memories must be melded together in order to get the robot to move and react at the speed required to fight the Kaiju, who are coming out of the rip in the ocean at an ever-increasing rate. The genius move that almost guarantees that emotion must be a factor in the <em>Pacific Rim</em> equation is that this mental "drifting" seems to be easier if the two pilots are related &mdash; brothers or fathers and sons seem like the best match. The downside to this is that if one of them is killed while the connection is still binding them, the trauma can be quite drastic.</p>

<p>When we meet pilots/brothers Raleigh and Yancy Becket (Charlier Hunnam and Diego Klattenhoff), the Jaeger program is fairly new and defeating the Kaiju is dangerous but far from impossible. The man in charge of the Jaeger program is former pilot Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), who seems committed to enunciating every line as loudly as possible, and we love him all the more for it. </p>

<p>After a tragedy befalls his team in a Kaiju battle, Raleigh leaves the Jaeger program to work on a giant wall that will literally run the length of the Pacific coast in hopes of keeping out the Kaiju, presumably making the Jaegers obsolete. But after video surfaces of a Kaiju plowing through a similar wall in Sydney, Pentecost comes looking for qualified pilots to keep the Jaeger program going, including a hesitant Raleigh. The Kaiju are surfacing every few days at this point rather than weeks or months, and it becomes clear that soon the gateway they use to come to Earth (called the Breach) will soon just open up and unleash hell on earth. The mission now becomes not just killing Kaiju, but finding a way to plug the portal.</p>

<p>The thing I admired almost immediately about <em>Pacific Rim</em> was its sense of scale, and I don't mean how tall the monsters or robots are. One of the biggest problems I have with films about the end of the world (or the possible end) is that they tend to focus on a small group of people, and we never get a true sense of the global repercussions of whatever the destructive force might be. Granted, <em>Pacific Rim</em> mainly concerns itself with the destruction of coastal cities (San Francisco gets it bad, along with Seattle, Hong Kong, Alaska, etc.), but we get a sense through "news" footage just how massive this threat really is.</p>

<p>Character work has always been Del Toro's strong suit, and we truly do care about most of the major characters in this film, in particular the pilots. Aside from his accent issues (he's an Australian playing American), Hunnam actually does a great job wearing his pain and anxiety on his face and convincing us that he may not be ready to return to battle. But through his relationship with pilot-in-training Mako Mori (the great Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi), who ends up becoming his co-pilot, he is able not only to help her deal with her own past trauma but also work through his as well. Consider their missions the most expensive group therapy ever committed to film. And not surprisingly, their drifting experience causes them to become very protective of each other; thankfully, the film stops just shy of turning them into a couple, but things certainly seem to be headed in that direction when we leave them.</p>

<p>There have been a few people who believe that <em>Pacific Rim</em> could become this generation's <em>Star Wars</em>, which is, of course, ridiculous. First off, even if that did end up happening, we wouldn't know it for years until the pre-teens and teens of this era started making movies of their own a decade or more from now. And yes, I'm sure some kids who see this film will be inspired by its jaw-dropping visuals and impressive emotional content. But I'm guessing other movies that came out this and previous years have the same amount of potential to inspire impressionable minds as well. I'd love for Del Toro to be the shaper of young minds; don't get me wrong. But let's scale back on trying to predict the future of movies and judge <em>Pacific Rim</em> on its merits rather than its sway. That being said, if I'd seen this film when I was 12 or 13, my brain would have melted with glee.</p>

<p>I haven't really talked about the action sequences, which dwarf (literally and figuratively) much that has come before them. There's such an enormity to what we're seeing (especially if you're lucky enough to see the film in proper IMAX projection) that it's almost overwhelming. I found myself opening my eyes wider to let more of the image into my brain. The unique designs of both the Jaegers and especially the Kaiju are so impressive; each one reflects a specific attitude and personality, along with weaponry and biology. I found myself wanting to stop the film so I could really marvel at these creations and the way they move, fight, recover, and fall apart.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Rim</em> is not without its faults, and chief among them are the non-pilot supporting parts. I say this as someone who has always enjoyed Charlie Day as a scene-stealing force in movies before, but as a researcher looking into the brain functions of the Kaiju, the only reason he is in the film is to reveal a key piece of information at the very end of the movie that changes the mission of the Jaegers as they attempt to close the wormhole. He has a few funny lines and his pairing with fellow researcher &mdash; a numbers man played by Burn Gorman &mdash; is vaguely amusing in small doses. Unfortunately, we get large doses of them, and they go from comic relief to major time suck. Whenever the film cut to his storyline, I groaned. I was happy to have the occasional moment to breathe away from the action, but a lot of Day in this film goes a looooong way.</p>

<p>The one upside to Day's plot (courtesy of Del Toro and co-writer Travis Beacham) is that it brings him together with Ron Perlman's Hannibal Chau, a black market seller and distributor of Kaiju body parts. His team of thugs moves in as soon as a monster hits the ground, and before long Kaiju bones have been powdered and are being sold as a male enhancement drug. It's a fun little side story that combines silly behavior with a deeper look at how the world has changed because of the Kaiju.</p>

<p>Another unnecessary aspect to <em>Pacific Rim</em> is a rivalry set up between Raleigh's Jaegar (named Gipsy Danger) and one piloted by the father-son team of Herc and Chuck Hansen (Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky, a newcomer to recent episodes of HBO's "True Blood"). The younger Hansen sees the Gipsy Danger crew as emotionally damaged and not ready for the big final mission, which may be true, but an awful lot of time is committed to this dopey in-fighting, and with the world's end literally at stake, I find it hard to believe these pilots would waste the effort trying to figure out who is the more capable pilot when it's clear they both have to perform equally well.</p>

<p>But I see these flaws in <em>Pacific Rim</em> because what surrounds them is damn-near perfect. I want to watch this film a dozen more times today and then repeat the procedure tomorrow. If some or most parts of this movie don't thrill you, there might be something broken. That's not an insult; I'm genuinely concerned for your well being. This is easily the best all-purpose film the summer has given us so far, and I've enjoyed works like <em>Iron Man 3</em> and <em>Man of Steel</em> to varying degrees. But there's a smart, imaginative brain behind <em>Pacific Rim</em>. When I first saw the image of the Breach, I thought of Del Toro's mind finally able to explode onto the screen and wreak havoc on his audience. There are a few surprises scattered throughout, but mainly it's just an old-fashioned good time. And yes, I feel confident kids will love it too; it might even open up a new part of their imaginations, with any luck.</p>

<h3>20 Feet From Stardom</h3>
<p>Not since the great <em>Standing in the Shadows of Motown</em> has a music doc done so much justice to a group of individuals who have previous never properly had the spotlight shone upon them. <em>20 Feet From Stardom</em> takes a thorough and loving look at a group of largely female backup singers whose work you absolutely know, even if you don't know their names. With voices as powerful as Diana Ross or Aretha Franklin, some of these performers made attempts at the spotlight with unheralded albums and concerts, but for reasons that range from bad timing to lack of confidence, women like Merry Clayton, Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer, Gloria Jones, Claudia Lennear, Táta Vega and Jo Lawry were known throughout the music world for their glorious voices but never quite made that long journey from the back to center stage.</p>

<p>Much of <em>20 Feet From Stardom</em> is just these wonderful singers telling stories about performing, recording and otherwise working for top-of-the-bill artists going back to Darlene Love's countless sessions with producer Phil Spector, many of which were credited to other artists, even though she sang lead vocals on so many hit singles. Love is one of the few who managed to get to the spotlight, but only after quitting the music business altogether and cleaning houses for years before deciding to return and regain her crown. In the 1970s, the age of the backup singer was nearing the end in America, but in an effort to sound more soulful, many British artists (Joe Cocker, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, among others) hired these singers to record and tour with them.</p>

<p>Merry Clayton's incredible story about being called in the middle of the night to come into the studio pregnant and in curlers to record with the Rolling Stones the unforgettable female vocal on "Gimme Shelter" could be an entire film unto itself. And hearing her isolated vocals from that song will make your knees weak. Clayton's other great story involves her singing background vocals on Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" as a form of protest against the racist values the song seems to celebrate.</p>

<p>But the film doesn't stop with just stories; director Morgan Neville makes an attempt to analyze why certain exceedingly talented artists make it and some don't. It quickly becomes clear that a few of them, at least, feel more comfortable in a supporting position. The film spends a great deal of time with singer Lisa Fischer, who continues to tour with the Stones, Sting and many others, and is arguably the finest pure vocalist in the film. But it becomes clear that she's not interested in becoming a headliner, and she ends up becoming a show-stopper during other performers' concerts.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest endorsement these unsung musical heroes comes from the artists who hired or admired them, including Mick Jagger, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen and Sting. And lest you think the phenomenon of backup singers is a thing of the past, the film also spotlights recent "The Voice" contestant Judith Hill, who was set to sing behind Michael Jackson on the tour he was rehearsing for when he died (she also sang "We Are the World" at his memorial service). Hill desperately wants to be a solo performer, but will still sometimes take backup gigs for the money, as the film shows. But it's Love's story that has what most will consider the happiest ending, since she was inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame not long ago, and has been a favorite of everyone from Springsteen to David Letterman for decades And she seems like an absolute wonderful human being despite the many wrongs she's had to endure. You may go to <em>20 Feet From Stardom</em> for the endless parade of great songs, but you'll leave thinking about the countless, unforgettable tales of woe and triumph.</p>

<p>The film opens today in Chicago at the Landmark Century Center Cinema and the recently re-opened Landmark Renaissance in Highland Park. Performer Merry Clayton will be on hand for an audience Q&A on Friday at the Century after the 7:05pm show, and Saturday at the Renaissance after the 7:45pm screening.</p>

<h3>Dealin' with Idiots</h3>
<p>In his 2006 debut feature <em>I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With</em>, writer-director-star Jeff Garlin explored in a very sweet and funny way the process those of us who are socially awkward and unconventional go about beginning and maintaining a relationship. And I'll admit, I walked into his latest work, <em>Dealin' with Idiots</em>, thinking this was going to be a similarly toned work about the parents Garlin's character Max Morris meets at his son's little league games. I was thinking the film would be light observations humor with a few "these people are crazy" style comments. </p>

<p>What we get instead is something more judgmental, even condemning (and I don't say that as a criticism) of parents who either hover over their kids in the most oppressive way possible or barely notice their kids as they stay glued to their phones or watching anything but their children. Garlin is a keen observer, and the darker tones of <em>Idiots</em> makes for a slightly edgier movie in the end. Max is a fairly famous stand-up comic who is looking to make his next movie and decides that this parenting freak show would make a great subject, so he asks the parents and coaches if he can interview and observe them for research, which of course leads to a flurry of activity within the peanut gallery.</p>

<p>Using a largely improvisation approach (although the screenplay is credited to Garlin and Peter Murrieta), Garlin allows actors such as Fred Willard, Bob Odenkirk, Richard Kind, Steve Agree, Kerri Kenney, Gina Gershon, Jami Gertz and his "Curb Your Enthusiasm" co-star J.B. Smoove to cut loose with mixed, mostly funny results. My favorite scenes involve Max with his wife, played by Nia Vardalos, whose dialed-back approach to her character is a nice touch; and Timothy Olyphant, who appears as an influential presence in Max's life (I don't want to be too specific because his identity is kind of a secret), who gives Max some sage advice when he needs it most.</p>

<p>More so than than more scripted <em>Cheese</em>, <em>Dealin' with Idiots</em> catches its cast flailing a bit, and some of the jokes don't land. But the film also isn't meant to be entirely a comedy, as the behavior and attitudes of the whack-job parents begin to rub off on Max and impact his state of mind. The film strikes more of a raw nerve emotionally as Max begins to have doubts about many parts of his life and career, especially when it comes to his parenting. Some may find the movie too angry or mean for its own good, but I liked watching Garlin try out new corners of his acting range. If you don't mind a little naked aggression in your life, this might be the film for you.</p>

<p><em>Dealin' with Idiots</em> opens today in Chicago at the Music Box Theatre. Writer-director-star-Chicagoan Jeff Garlin will be one hand after the 7:20pm shows on Friday and Saturday for an audience Q&A, moderated by me.</p>

<h3>The Look of Love</h3>
<p>Prolific British director Michael Winterbottom seems to go out of his way to do something different with each new film that it took me by surprise that he's now made four films with <em>24 Hour Party People</em> star Steve Coogan (they've also done <em>Tristram Shandy</em> and <em>The Trip</em>), and all of their works together stand as some of Winterbottom's most entertaining and artistically satisfying. Perhaps attempting to recapture a bit of <em>Party People</em>'s chaotic, decadent vibe, the pair have now made the sexually charged biopic <em>The Look of Love</em>, an examination of the life of erotic entrepreneur Paul Raymond, who owned and operated everything from adult publishing companies to nude revues to strip clubs, and at one point was the richest man in all of England (I'm guessing members of the Royal Family weren't on that list, but maybe they were).</p>

<p>Raymond began his business career as a family man who collected Soho real estate, had a happy marriage to wife Jean (Anna Friel), with whom he had two children, including the beloved Debbie (played as an adult by Imogen Poots). But as Paul became more successful and was constantly surrounded by gorgeous women all wanting to be in his successful nude shows, he indulged in sins of the flesh with other women, with his wife's reluctant permission.</p>

<p>One day, a tall, stunning redhead named Amber (real name Fiona) came to audition for Paul, and he practically forgot his wife's name. As the free-love 1960s transitioned into the drug-fueled 1970s, Paul dumped Jean and took up with the more open-minded Amber, who quickly became a part of his publishing empire as a sex advice columnist. <em>The Look of Love</em> zips through Raymond's life with such energy that it feels like we're getting more of an impression of his life than a detailed account. But the cumulative effect is powerful, especially when the film puts the microscope on his relationship with his daughter, whose singing career he attempts to help launch. Her path down a cocaine highway is ferocious and ugly.</p>

<p>The film borrows some stylistic cues from the likes of <em>The People vs. Larry Flynt</em> and <em>Boogie Nights</em>, but Winterbottom is careful not to let us ever think too highly of Paul, and Coogan plays him as the bastard he was to nearly everyone around him. If we believe the film's lovely coda, most of the empire he built was for the benefit of his kids, but the way he mistreats them and their mother never really allows us to view him as truly sympathetic or likable. I certainly don't need a likable character at the center of every movie that I enjoy, and Coogan's performance is just the right level of shitheel. There are plenty of other characters to like in this story (Amber, especially), don't worry.</p>

<p>Adding a wonderful pop soundtrack to the mix (including quite a few Burt Bacharach-written numbers) really boosts the enjoyability factor of <em>The Look of Love</em>. While the abrasive qualities of Paul Raymond may be too much for some to bear, I found the performance by Coogan to be so unbelievably watchable that I simply didn't care that he was such a prick. Paul's giant bed with skylight that looked up into the stars when its mirrored ceiling opened up was all I needed to see to know that I would enjoy this film immensely. It opens for a weeklong run beginning today in Chicago at the Gene Siskel Film Center.</p>

<h3>Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me</h3>
<p>While my knowledge of the music of Big Star is solid, the details of their career and backstory were a complete mystery to me. Courtesy of the extensive documentary from directors Drew DeNicola and Olivia Mori, the details of the Memphis-based band that featured former Box Tops singer Alex Chilton is now told through a series of great interviews from both surviving band members, music historians, and long-time famous fans of the group whose commercial success was never as important as their influence on what came after their brief three-album run (all three of which landed on Rolling Stone magazine's top 500 albums of all time).</p>

<p>If you've heard <em>#1 Record</em>, the debut album from 1971 by Alex Chilton, Chris Bell, Jody Stephens and Andy Hummel, it's likely you remember the circumstances surrounding your first listen. The band is undeniably talented, but it seemed like it was formed out of Chilton's frustration with being so successful at such a young age as the singer of several big hits in the late 1960s, including the monster single "The Letter." Many in the film make the point that much of Chilton's career has been a series of going in the complete opposite direction of what he's just done, much to the frustration of many fans of Big Star.</p>

<p><em>Nothing Can Hurt Me</em> features the usual treasure trove of previously unseen footage, studio outtakes (mostly of conversation and not unreleased music), and revealing interviews (both new and archival) with the band. Perhaps the best stories in the film aren't even about the band; they are about its record company attempting to organize music writers by inviting several dozen of them to Memphis on the company dime and showcasing its artists at a big party, which Big Star headlined and actually got the group of jaded rock journalists to dance.</p>

<p>The film also tracks each band member's lives after the band broke up after its third record, which all admit was essentially a Chilton solo album with Big Star playing behind him. Interviews with members of The Replacements, REM, Flaming Lips and others round out the film nicely and provide the necessary context for Big Star's circle of influence. We get to watch the agonizingly painful life of Chris Bell after the band's demise, and the weird, trippy road that Chilton took until his death three years ago, right before a big tribute to his career was planned at SXSW. The film exudes melancholy for every frame, and that seems wholly appropriate. It's a great journey through the birth of a type of music that doesn't really have a name beyond "great," and defies genres with authority.</p>

<p>The film will have two showings next week at the Music Box Theatre, on Monday, July 15 at 7:30pm; and Wednesday, July 17 at 7:30pm.</p>
