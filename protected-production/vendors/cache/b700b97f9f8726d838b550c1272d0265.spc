        <p>At this time, you may have heard of the immense amount of hoopla concerning <a href="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/2013/04/18/bye_bye_congress_theater/">the renovations of the Congress Theater</a>, the main music hub of the Logan Square / Wicker Park area. However, there is a new music venue in town as Congress Theater's newest neighbor, emerging to showcase much of the music clientele that would have played at the Congress during this time of updates, with a new and fresh identity arriving with it.</p>

<p><a href="http://concordmusichall.com">Concord Music Hall</a>, located at 2047 N. Milwaukee Avenue, was founded by three promoters notable for the advent of dynamic music festivals <a href="http://www.riotfest.org">Riot Fest</a>, <a href="http://www.northcoastmusicfestival.com">North Coast Music Festival</a> and <a href="http://www.springawakeningfestival.com">Spring Awakening</a>. Associated with <a href="http://www.reactpresents.com">React Presents</a> and <a href="http://www.silverwrapper.com">Silver Wrapper</a>, the venue is certainly going to book high-caliber acts with a range of musical genres. As the Congress did, the venue is looking to book expansive music ranges, from electronic music, to rock, indie, and hip hop. 20,000 feet of square feet adorns the venue, with capacity set to 1,600 maximum. The name arises from the definition, focusing on agreement between groups, and in this venue's case, genres, as it focuses on variety and balance.</p>

<p>August 17th marks the first official show date for the venue, featuring eccentric punk artist <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com">Gogol Bordello</a> (who was indeed originally slated to perform at the Congress). The venue is also anticipated to host frequent festival after shows associated with Riot Fest and North Coast. Other confirmed shows, listed below, include after shows featuring The Disco Biscuits, and stand alone concerts featuring Jimmy Cliff, Boys Noise, and Less Than Jake, spanning a range of genres and sure to fit many different music tastes.<br />

8.17 - Gogol Bordello<br />
8.24 - Boombox<br />
8.30 - North Coast Music Festival: AlunaGeorge (Live), Passion Pit (DJ Set), Capital Cities (DJ Set)<br />

<p>We sat down with hometown MC <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mctreegee">Tree</a> after he kicked off Sunday afternoon in Union Park, serving up Soul Trap and some Chicago pride under the sun. After answering a quick phone call and relaxing a bit backstage, Tree spoke with us about playing SXSW, discussed the Chicago hip hop community and what inspires him in our city. It was a lovely way to relax and end our weekend chatting with artist in Union Park. </p>

<p>The last day of a music festival is always bittersweet, the tired sunburned aching feet of the weekend passes shuffling around, making their last festival purchases and mustering up the energy to dance along to the last few songs. Mixed in Sunday was a large crowd of impeccably dressed older fans setting up camp for headliner R. Kelly, a strong showing of hip hop heads ready to catch the day most catered to their taste, and a lot of electronic fans camped out at the Blue Stage, creating one of the most diverse and excitedly allegiant crowds of fans in attendance at Pitchfork Festival yet this weekend. Whatever acts you were there to see, Sunday made sure you'd participate at some point, whether it be shimmying at MIA, moshing at Lil B, or steppin in the name of love. <em>-Lisa White </em></p>
        <p><img alt="Killer Mike_9338963985_l.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/Killer%20Mike_9338963985_l.jpg" width="500" height="332" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Killer Mike by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>Day three in Union Park boasted a more hip-hop and electronic-oriented lineup than any of the festival's other days, kicking things off with local MC <a href="https://twitter.com/MCTREEG">Tree</a> at the main Green Stage.<br />
Tree's glitchy soul-trap and lively stage presence (bolstered by an entourage of matching hype-men) certainly made an impression on the early R. Kelly fans already camping out at the front of the stage, and he provided a fitting segue into Killer Mike's set of impassioned hip-hop. The MC made a few sermon's mid set aimed toward the youth of Chicago, imploring them "to give a damn about each other" and for everyone across the city to "get to know your neighbor." It made for a serious moment of reflection, and Killer Mike (his name taking on an unfortunate irony here) was noticeably emotional speaking to the crowd. His set was super-charged, though, with standout tracks like "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lIqNjC1RKU">Reagan</a>," and when he was transported via golf cart to join collaborator <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/">El-P</a> on the Red Stage immediately following his set for their Run the Jewels collab, he easily made the strongest impression early. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>A lot has changed since <a href="https://www.facebook.com/THEREALELP‎">El-P</a> took the stage a few years ago during Pitchfork Festival 2010. With a slew of new music, most noticeably his collaboration with Killer Mike on their project Run the Jewels, El-P showed a more self assured set, clearly having more fun this time around. No surprise since him and Killer Mike have an undeniable energy when they work together, whether it be on beer or hip hop (the two worked with Goose Island to release a special edition beer for the festival). The first bit of El-P's set showcased his own heady thumping bass beats, but everything was amplified once he brought Killer Mike onstage. The sum of two equally passionate and socially conscious MCs collide in the best of ways to create a live show that encourages a helping of thought and change alongside your mosh pit experience. If you haven't checked our the Run the Jewels self titled release, do so now. It's still free online, so you really have no excuse. <a href="http://www.foolsgoldrecs.com/runthejewels/">Here it is</a>. Their live set Sunday was testament to why doing what you love and caring deeply about it creates some of the most passionate art around. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

You can't quite call it a trainwreck because the savant-in-pajamas, Ariel-Pink-in-1967 thing is all part of Sam France's schtick, but when he started to climb the rafters of the stage and took a few audience plunges too many (causing technical problems with bandmate Rado's guitar), the whole thing started to get a little cringe-worthy. Sure, the songs were fine if a little thin on the outdoor stage, and it still seems like France is learning how to sing into a microphone, but I swear there were more moments of dead, awkward silence coming from the stage than anything else throughout their set. They might have played six or seven short pop songs in 45 minutes. Plagued by discontinuity and a deluge of "thank-yous," France's gestures toward showmanship turned into a panicked gap-filler in less than 15 minutes, and he seemed more comfortable waving at the crowd than anything else. Which isn't saying much, as no one on that stage seemed remotely comfortable at all. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>Elsewhere on the Blue Stage, <a href="http://waxahatchee.bandcamp.com/">Waxahatchee</a> was nailing the early-90s soothsaying of Mazzy Star and PJ Harvey and making it decidedly her own. Her songs are pure pop and arrive fully-formed, with each lilt in her voice giving personality and menace to her lovelorn lyrics while her guitar drove the whole thing along and kept things from getting too sleepy. <a href="http://waxahatchee.bandcamp.com/">Chairlift</a>'s similarly dreamy performance a few hours later was more textured by synths and ethereal aesthetics, and I found myself missing Waxahatchee's more upfront jangle. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.yolatengo.com">Yo La Tengo</a> seems to be at the highest, most visible point in their career, strangely enough, in 2013. Ira Kaplan quipped that they were happy to be sharing a stage with <a href="http://www.r-kelly.com">R. Kelly</a> once again (noting that they had been on a tour of Europe together in 1996) and launched into a mellow, feedback-drenched set that mesmerized a legion of kids who probably were more fascinated by the noise the old folks were making onstage than anything else. But, oh, what a glorious noise they made: Georgia Hubley guested on lead vocals for a downtempo version of mid-90s classic "Tom Courtenay", while the band played a trio of songs from their excellent <i>I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One</i>, including "Little Honda," "Stockholm Syndrome," and "Autumn Sweater." An epic version of "Blue Line Swinger" closed out their set, as Kaplan continued his reign as feedback charmer extraordinaire. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>As the sold out crowd continued to stream into the field and cell phone usage became impossible, I decided to camp out near the Red Stage to find a good dance party spot for M.I.A. and R. Kelly, getting to catch some Lil B and Toro Y Moi in the process. First up was the Internet sensation, the one and only self proclaimed Based God, <a href="http://www.basedworld.com/‎">Lil B</a>. He is probably one of the more interesting rappers and personalities around right now, bringing with him a pack of fans that are allegiant to the point of cult like creepy at times. He preaches love and positivity, even going so far as to lecture on some of his ideas last year at NYU. He also creates some of the most insane lyrics and general sound bites around. His Sunday set dished out much expected weirdness, including samples from an ice cream truck and a short cover of the chorus of Drowning Pool's "Bodies" while aggro youth (many probably not familiar with the song since they were still under the age of ten at that point in life) moshed along. Personally I'm not a fan of Lil B. His campy bumper "Ellen Degeneres" was amusing, but sonically it's not the style of hip hop I prefer. And any crowd that includes signs proclaiming that the performer can "fuck my bitch" makes me feel a bit weird as a girl. But thats the weird dichotomy that runs throughout a lot of hip hop, a world where peace and love is dished out with subtle and not so subtle misogyny at the same time. Whether you take it with a grain of salt or take offense, the set was at least an interesting study into the fandom of the Based God, and for that we thank him. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p>When I look back on the weekend, the most fun I had at a set will be without a doubt <a href="http://www.miauk.com/‎">M.I.A.</a> Despite some serious sound issues, M.I.A. turned the field into one big dance party during a set that showcased the best of her work. A far cry from the stripped down messy sets at other Chicago festivals, her show Sunday was clearly well thought out, edited, and executed. In front of a carnival of lights and flanked by a dance crew furiously working up a sweat, M.I.A. barely slowed down while running through a setlist comprised mostly of upbeat popular tracks. She was smart to include a hyperactive stage set up and back up dance squad, since M.I.A. alone isn't the most deft performer to watch. A smart setlist was the backbone of her set, barely slowing down from bass and horn shaker "XR2" before rolling flawlessly into "Bucky Done Gone" "Bird Flu" "Bamboo Banga" and "Sunshowers," all these high energy hits right in a row. The frenzied set didn't take a break until the brief drone cool down of "Story to Be Told," only pausing before ending her set with her most well known singles. "Born Free," her foray into old school punk sound, was raw as ever, while her first commercial success "Galang" has never lost its shimmering pop edge. The crowd sung along to her most popular hit "Paper Planes" although most Chicagoans took pause to realize the uncomfortable feeling watching a crowd of people pretend to shoot guns in the air alongside the proper sound sample less than a few miles away from some of the most dangerous areas of our city. Art should make you take pause and think, so at least for the many mentioning this factor M.I.A.'s work was doing it's job. Not to end on a somber note, because you can still be socially aware while still having a good time, the set was wrapped up with the more recent single "Bad Girls." Despite horrible sound issues, the backing track completely cutting in and out until M.I.A. barked for them to shut it off as she finished it acapella, the set ended with a singalong cool down after one of the more high energy dance parties of the weekend. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

Kelly by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>Later on at the Red Stage, <a href="http://www.basedworld.com">Lil B</a> played to his cult of IRL and online followers, giving them a heavy dose of bass, while M.I.A. came on shortly after with an elaborate stage design and backup dancers to pad her glitchy world-house beats and pop bravado. But the real reason everyone had stayed was to catch the Pied Piper of R&B himself, his Kellyness, no matter the ambivalent feelings about separating the artist from the artist's alleged deviant sexual habits. But I doubt many were <I>too</i> concerned with all of that when "Fiesta" played, or when "Step in the Name of Love" blared through the monitors. And while R. Kelly played a set of largely punctuated verse-and-chorus versions of his better-known tracks, what remained was a hit parade of his career ("Trapped in the Closet" notwithstanding) that easily met to the crowd's expectations. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

Kelly by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>I forfeited checking out TNGHT in the hopes I'll see them next time they are in Chicago to witness what would surely be one of the most over the top sets of the weekend, Sunday's headliner <a href="http://www.r-kelly.com/‎">R. Kelly</a>. First, let's get the elephant in the room out of the way. Yes, R. Kelly is a very complicated man, a person who mentally went through a lot at a young age that influenced some horrible choices he has made in his personal life that affected many people. He is a person I hope has sought out a lot of mental health, and I don't condone or approve of his behavior. Same as I don't condone or approve of the personal choice and behavior of numerous music visionaries like for example James Brown or Ray Charles or Jimmy Page. That said, I can personally separate the musical output and artistic creativity from the person making it. Not everyone can do this, so I understand the outrage many had with R. Kelly playing the festival this year. I've had to learn to compartmentalize certain emotions and judgements when it comes to being able to enjoy art from a person I vehemently disagree with, and it is a complicated range of emotions to deal with as a writer, fan, and depending on the issue at hand, as a woman. So I am not denying or ignoring any of that. If you want to wax on about these social stigmas and issues around all of this, feel free to check out the numerous think pieces floating around, but now that we've established these facts lets move on to what really mattered to most of the audience Sunday night. </p>

<p>If you have witnessed R. Kelly live, there is no denying the fact he is an impeccable showmen that deserves all the praise and attention for his music over his very long career. The man is 46, hustling since '89, and still is able to turn out an ambitious set, including full versions and snippets of 38 songs Sunday night. As a personalized countdown told the crowd it was "t-minus R sixty seconds" until the show would begin, a full church choir filed onstage. The choir backed Kelly's entrance as he greeted the field of fans, and then he immediately wasted no time as he launched into his popular hit "Ignition (Remix)" and the crowd completely lost it. People were screaming, singing, and dancing along, and from where I stood there was no trace of irony in sight. People were legitimately having a wonderful time as Kelly dished out some more party anthems like "Hotel" and "Fiesta." He did a quick cover of Kanye's "Flashing Lights" a lovely shout out to another hometown hero as he set continued, full of a few covers and numerous snippets of his catalog. It's no surprise given the size of his catalog that some songs performed were just the first verse and chorus, similar to Eminem's performance a few years ago at Lollapalooza. It's a bit annoying at times if you were expecting a full version of a favorite song, but Kelly kept the energy and pace up so that you barely had time to be disappointed before another hit began. Full of his usual confidence verging on bravado, Kelly did his usual sing-talk monologues between songs, discussing everything from his workout routine to needing a towel to wipe his face. The set included a large portion of his sexually charged slow jams and party tunes, but towards the end showcased some of his classic soul stepping music. During "Happy People" older couples showcased impressive moves, bringing some real soul to the baseball diamond dance floor of Union Park. Younger fans enjoyed "Im a Flirt" before Kelly ended the night with his most recognizable hit, "I Believe I Can Fly." The full choir returned as he dedicated the song to his hometown, the crowd singing along to every word and note of the well known pop ballad. As if it couldn't get any more surreal, at the most dramatic apex of the song white dove balloons were released over the audience, Kelly's voice crystal clear and full of emotion as stage lights flared and the last notes vibrated off the city walls. It was a wonderful high note to end the weekend on, a nice parting gift to remember the festival by until next year.<em> -Lisa White</em></p>

<p>The wind was blowing out on a hot and humid Friday afternoon at the corner of Clark and Addison, which always is a perfect recipe for a lot of hits. With the Cubs in Colorado, playing the Rockies, the hits came from grunge-era rockers <a href="http://pearljam.com">Pearl Jam</a>, who made their debut in the Friendly Confines.</p>

<p>The iconic band, which has played together for the past 20-plus years, has seen it all, playing in legendary venues from The Offramp in Seattle to Soldier Field. It only was a matter of time before they rocked it out in front of the ivy.</p>

<p>Though hailing from Seattle, front man Eddie Vedder was born and raised in Evanston, and grew up rooting on the northsiders back when "Mr. Cub," Ron Santo and Billy Williams were gracing the covers of programs. So needless to say, the anticipation of hearing classic 90s hits such as "Alive," "Even Flow," and "Spin The Black Circle;" Mr. Vedder's homecoming; a beautiful sunset in a gem of a ballpark made for a perfect storm in what was to be a night to remember. That's right when the wind began to shift from the west and cloud cover began to set in.</p>
        <p>The show kicked off a little before 8:30pm with the familiar tear-jerking ballad "Release," off of the band's debut album <em>Ten</em>. As each song began, more and more clouds began to form overhead, which appeared to turn darker in color with flashes of lightning in the distance.</p>

<p><img alt="PearlJamRain.jpg.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/PearlJamRain.jpg.jpg" width="317" height="235" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />The band played on, ripping through slower jams which included "Nothingman," "Low Light," and "Come Back." After the band finished its seventh song of the early evening, the catchy sing-along "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town," Mr. Vedder did his best Tom Skilling impression and announced the band and crew were going to pack it up and head for cover for a little while, due to the impending storm, but promised they'd be back to finish out the evening.</p>

<p>And just like that, those who waited in line earlier in the afternoon to make their way to the front of the stage, were now being asked to head to the tunnels in order to avoid injury from a storm that promised to pack a punch. No one seemed to mind, however, especially with memories of the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/indiana-state-fair-death-toll-higher-fluke-storm/story?id=14302288">Indiana State Fair stage collapse</a> in 2011, due to a storm ripping through the Midwest.</p>

<p>With the crowd heading for cover on the infield, the crowds tucked away under the grandstands made its way to beer lines and bathrooms, all in a friendly, casual manner. Where something of this magnitude might not have gone so graciously 20 years ago with single, early 20-somethings, when grunge rock swept the world with angry lyrics and cynicism, a more patient and understanding 40-something crowd made friends and exchanged pictures on smart phones, comparing Pearl Jam baby onsies and stories of their respective concert-going experiences in days past.</p>

<p>It's funny how time manages to heal all wounds and calm the soul from youthful aggression. There once was a time when Mr. Vedder himself would scowl at a flashing camera or appear short in conversation with a cheering crowd at a show, in an attempt to be private, perhaps in fear of losing some sort of innocence that comes with being an artist. Then, somewhere along the way, perhaps after fathering his first child, he appeared more playful at shows and more approachable to the public.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Vedder, and the band in general, have remained just as popular as ever &mdash; perhaps even more so &mdash; and managed to keep every single patron inside the halls of Wrigley and wait out the two-and-one-half hour delay.</p>

<p><img alt="PearlJamCrowdGone.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/PearlJamCrowdGone.jpg" width="316" height="227" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />As Friday slowly drifted into Saturday morning, the clouds cleared, the temperature dropped, if only a few degrees, and the crowds began to make their way back onto the field for the remainder of the show. The crew peeled away tarps over equipment and tested strobe lights and spot lights, as well as the two giant jumbotrons on either side of the stage.</p>

<p>The questions remaining were how much longer the band would play and what would they start with after the long delay. It would have been easy to send the crowd into a frenzy with such heavy jolts as "Spin The Black Circle," or "Evolution," but Mr. Vedder strolled out with his acoustic guitar, thanked everyone for their patience, promised the rain-soaked crowd the curfew had been extended and introduced his buddy, Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub himself, to help him along with his love song to his favorite team, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqHTScDBsDU">"Someday We'll Go All The Way."</a></p>

<p>From there, the band cranked through a set list of heavier tunes that included "All Night," "State of Love and Trust," and "Rearviewmirror." The band also jumped into three brand new songs, which will appear on its upcoming album, <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, available on October 15. The first was the the band's current single, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhODYyZVL6Y">Mind Your Manners</a>," a high-tempo track with aggressive guitar rips from Mike McCready. The next was the album title track "Lightning Bolt," and the third, a beautiful ballad, "Future Days," which opens with longtime producer Brendan O'Brien on the piano and started right after the encore break.</p>

<p>In between, the crowd was treated to what now has become Pearl Jam staples, or even clichés, such as McCready playing the guitar behind his head; the heart-stopping finish to "Rearviewmirror;" the band closing with Neil Young's "Rockin' in the Free World." And while all of these predictable moves are always satisfying and nailed with perfection, it was refreshing to see something rare, like Vedder strolling out with an accordion to play the very paranoid-sounding "Bugs," or the old Mother Love Bone track "Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns."</p>

<p>As the night wound down/morning drew near, the band kept everyone engaged and awake. On this night, there weren't any complaints from Wrigleyville rooftop owners about any jumbotrons or noise ordinance orders from within the town charter. There wasn't any bickering between Alderman Tom Tunney, the city council and Beth Murphy, owner of Murphy's Bleachers and spokesperson for the Wrigleyville Rooftops. There only was good music, a double-header of a show and a more matured crowd, cheering on its band they grew up with lo these many years.</p>

<p>With the hot afternoon sun quickly drying up any remaining mud or sign of Friday night's <a href="http://www.bjork.com/">Bjork-ending torrential storm</a>, day two of Pitchfork promised to be another scorcher for what is perhaps their most heavy lineup of artists all weekend. As tank top-clad kids, overdressed aging punks, and everyone in between filed their way into Union Park for the earlier gate opening, the sounds of some of the angrier, more confrontational bands of the Pitchfork roster were there to greet them, providing a stark wake up call to those still hungover from the first day's festivities. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>Pitchfork Festival saw another soggy ending last night, but not before dishing out a deep variety of acts to a much less humid crowd Saturday. Things kicked off with a double punch of speed and punk from Vancouver's <a href="http://whitelung.bandcamp.com/">White Lung</a>. Vocalist and guitarist Mish Way's voice wailed throughout the field as her band members kept up an impressive and on point beat. It was a much needed alarm clock to the start of the day, whether you wanted it or not, squelching anyones hope of an early afternoon nap laying in the shade. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>
        <p>Starting simultaneously on the Green and Blue Stages was <a href="http://whitelung.bandcamp.com/">White Lung</a> and <a href="http://www.ken-mode.com/">KEN MODE</a> respectively, each bringing their own turn-of-the 90s flair (starting to see a pattern here?) to either edge of the punk spectrum. White Lung clocked in a charged, whip-smart set of grungy power-pop tunes, landing somewhere between Hole and Dinosaur Jr.'s post-breakup years due in large part to frontwoman Mish Way's clear Courtney Love complex, who somehow managed to take all of Love's charismatic presence and snotty, confrontational singing without any of the apparent baggage or over-the-top theatrics that she eventually became known for. KEN MODE was a throwback to the classic post-hardcore, metal-leaning power-trio, combining all of the macho stagecraft, hair thrashing, and apocalypse-as-exhibitionism that you might expect from a band that takes its name from a term found in one of Henry Rollins's tour diaries (their name stands for Kill Everything Now Mode, Rollins and co.'s mindset/philosophy for some of the band's later tours.) Combining a wasteland sludge tone with slower, dirge-y tempos, the band brought the same kind of urgency to the Blue Stage as Friday afternoon's <a href="http://www.trashtalkhc.com/">Trash Talk</a> if not turning up the existentialist intensity a notch with lyrics like "Religion is a cancer," effectively getting things off to a properly loud start for a diverse day of (mostly) guitar-focused music in the shaded, more secluded corner of the fest. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><img alt="CHIRP Record Fair_9330503919_m.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/CHIRP%20Record%20Fair_9330503919_m.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>CHIRP Record Fair photo by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>At this point I was just killing time before catching <a href="http://parquetcourts.wordpress.com/">Parquet Courts</a>, and as I walked back over toward the <a href="http://chirpradio.org/">CHIRP tent</a> I could hear the open-plains '70s soft-rock lean of <a href="http://phosphorescentmusic.com/">Phosphorescent</a>, in all his Seger-esque glory, wafting across the park. So I walked on, eventually landing myself at the Flatstock poster fair, taking in the dozens of incredible artist booths filled with three-tone prints and intricately colored posters from local and national designers, among my favorites being a handful made by top-notch Chicago screen-printer <a href="http://www.ryanduggan.com/">Ryan Duggan</a>. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><img alt="Parquet Courts_9333297408_m.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/Parquet%20Courts_9333297408_m.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Parquet Courts photo by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>At about quarter to three, I made it back to the shaded Blue Stage (again, really can't overemphasize the <i>shade</i> part) to find the Parquet boys getting levels and fine-tuning their mix to the "T" before launching into their set. When everything was just-so, they launched into the quick-jab combination of <a href="http://dulltools.bigcartel.com/product/parquet-courts-light-up-gold-preorder-aug-18th"><i>Light Up Gold</i></a> standouts "Master of My Craft" and "Borrowed Time," all tightly coiled with dull, erudite guitars evoking Stephen Malkmus at his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUqEAdwuMps">most basic</a> or even a more tempered Sonic Youth. Which isn't to say these guys were soft: The band raved it up whenever they could, adding new dynamic intensity to <i>Gold</i>'s tracks while even playing a couple new ones, all the while proving to the Blue Stage's new believers that, yes, they really are that good as a live band and, yeah, they somehow managed to sound more like <a href="http://www.pinkflag.com/">Wire</a> than the band itself. The dual lead vocals of Austin Smith and Andrew Savage came across like a mix of the Black Lips and The Fall, if you replace Mark E. Smith's dour, post-industrial ramblings with, say, songs about North Dakota and Swedish Fish. Their set felt quick, if only because I realized half-way through that I had been singing the words to almost every song right with them. Closing on an epic medley of "Stoned and Starving" and "Light Up Gold Pt. II," the Parquets proved themselves to be one of the more exciting and expressive indie rock acts to emerge from NYC in... well, I don't know how long. Let's say awhile and leave it at that. -<em>Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>It's been a long loud road for <a href="http://andyouwillknowusbythetrailofdead.bandpage.com/">...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead</a>, consistently making some of the most intricate and abrasive prog and math rock since '94. Their 2002 release <em>Source Tags and Codes</em> garnered much deserved critical praise, a lesson in editing and subtle touches to create a rich big sound that any band would be lucky to figure out. The band spent a good portion of their set Saturday showcasing some of the material they are currently recording for their new album, the same energy and fervor that has been their signature for years, especially live. Although the band isn't spending as much time these days destroying their instruments live, they haven't settled down into the old age veteran status yet, both vocals and instrumentation as crystal clear and and fever pitched as ever. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p>The rest of the day continued to be sweltering, and I managed to catch the first few songs of Tampa Bay rockers <a href="http://merchandisetheband.wordpress.com/">Merchandise</a>, who sounded almost like a deconstructed, power-pop Soundgarden (that 90s thing again), before heading out to see <a href="http://savagesband.com/">Savages</a> over at the Green Stage at what was probably the hottest point of the day. Just as serious and on-point as reports from the London band have claimed, the band gave a no-bullshit performance of Factory Records-era post-punk with a near-religious fervor to tremendous response from the crowd. And as Savages frontwoman Jehnny Beth sang about "wanting to feel like I deserve it", she even set the mood for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeVJlLxGsmo">BDSM-leaning</a> kinky Catholics that would be taking the stage later that night. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><img alt="Swans_9333307308_m.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/Swans_9333307308_m.jpg" width="500" height="332" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Swans photo by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>Back on the Red Stage, <a href="http://swans.pair.com/">Swans</a> were as deconstructed, dissonant and dirge-like as you would hope, with Michael Gira leading the band through each corner of epic, slowed down sludge with a rock-kick at every turn. Kind of strange to see Gira and co. in such a sunny atmosphere (much less opening for Ms. <a href="http://www.solangemusic.com/#/">Solange</a> Knowles), admittedly, but nevertheless exciting to see the band still so vital and on point and daring to push their own boundaries after so many years. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><a href="http://breedersdigest.net">The Breeders</a> are one of those bands that I missed the first time around, born just a little too late to bare witness to a band when they were fresh and new. Like many I have to settle for reunion tours and revival acts to hear morsels of songs I grew up transfixed by a little too late. As much as I enjoyed hearing the bass line kick in on "Cannonball," The Breeders delivered a set plagued by low muddy sound and going through the motions stage presence that deflated quickly. <em>Last Splash</em> is a great album, but overall the set felt more like old friends getting together to jam a bit, reminiscent, and maybe get a paycheck and trip in the process. But here lies the problem with promoting an act playing their iconic album live; there is too much pressure to capture something special and important. This album is historic in music for a reason, so most people expect to feel something more when they witness it live. And some bands are great at this, for example Sonic Youth playing <em>Daydream Nation</em> at Pitchfork Festival in 2007. But The Breeders lacked the energy to get to this level Saturday. Kim Deal is still a rock god and a woman many aspire to be, and the band still can dish out an enjoyable set, but a set simply billed as The Breeders would have been more forgiving and more exciting for the band as well. "So, that was the record" Kim chuckled towards the end of their set. She sounded a bit bored and relieved to be done with the whole runaround of playing an album in one go. A carbon copy of nostalgia isn't everyone's idea of a sang song or rebirth, and it's a shame the Deal sisters and company weren't left to their own devices. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p><img alt="Pitchfork Music Festival 2013_9333292274_m.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/Pitchfork%20Music%20Festival%202013_9333292274_m.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Photo by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>After a short break, the Green Stage was once again alight with screams for charismatic leading lady Kim Deal and her <a href="http://breedersdigest.net/">Breeders</a>, who combed through <i>Last Splash</i> with an amicable looseness that was perhaps all too appropriate for the 90s nostalgia cloud currently affixed over Union Park. "Cannonball" sounded great, of course, though I can't say the rest of the album proved as memorable to the rest of the audience. The band took their time between songs, and both Deal sisters seemed to be in good spirits as the sun (finally) set opposite the stage. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>Let's go ahead and get out of the way the fact that whatever is in the drinking water at the Knowles residence is pure magic. Sharing a supreme drive, sense of perfection, and two amazing set of pipes, the Houston household is responsible not only for megastar Beyonce, but also for <a href="http://www.solangemusic.com">Solange</a>, the powerhouse vocalist that set a breezy tone late Saturday afternoon. After a foray into more traditional top 40 pop music, Solange has found her own sound with the release of her EP <em>True</em>. It's a subtle pop album, full of downtempo beats and harking back to the smooth vocals of 50s girl pop with a danceable beat. That beat was well utilized throughout the set, the crowd full of hips swaying in time. Solange herself looked flawless, her stage presence perfected, and her backing band engaging, showcasing an artist that clearly has complete control and approval of her entire artistic concept and product. She is a natural performer, charismatic, bubbly, and hitting notes that seem impossible effortlessly. She has found her groove musically, creating a sound and persona that is perfectly suited for her style, and it shows in the way her enthusiasm is infectious. Despite a shortened set, it was still one of the highlights and a breath of fresh air to kick off Saturday evening. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p><img alt="Stuart Murdoch, Belle &amp; Sebastian_9330507479_m.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/Stuart%20Murdoch%2C%20Belle%20%26%20Sebastian_9330507479_m.jpg" width="500" height="332" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Stuart Murdoch of Belle and Sebastian photo by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p><a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle & Sebastian</a> took the stage promptly at 8:30, diving right into fan favorites from throughout their career like "I'm A Cuckoo" and "Another Sunny Day." Stuart Murdoch was in a fine mood (one tasteless joke about gun violence aside), playing his role as the Pied Piper of ardent twee to great effect throughout the night. The dozen or so members onstage (including a small horn and string section) deftly moved throughout their entire catalogue, and Murdoch occasionally plucked fans from the crowd to the stage to dance or sing along to big lyric posters that he held "Subterranean Homesick Blues"-style.Closing with a rapturous "Judy and the Dream of Horses", and playing a single-song encore of "Get Me Away I'm Dying", the band certainly leaned more heavily on tracks from <i>If You're Feeling Sinister</i> and their late 90s heyday; though as we've seen, they were hardly alone in their pre-millenial yearning. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>Only Bjork and her Tesla coil could whip up a storm so savage that it shut down <a href="http://pitchforkmusicfestival.com/">Pitchfork Festival</a> early Friday night. The Icelandic nymph closed out the night after a breezy but hot kickoff to the weekend activities. Water lines were long throughout the day and many people were napping in the field during Joanna Newsom's set to muster up some much needed energy to last until the finish line of the Friday. The weather made us miss some of Bjork, but it will at least bring much appreciated cooler temperatures for the rest of the festival weekend. -<em>Lisa White</em></p>

<p>Though the first day of Pitchfork was eventually defined by the expected-but-somehow-out-of-nowhere downpour of rain that called an early halt to <a href="http://www.bjork.com/">Bjork</a>'s headlining set, the rest of the day was marked by a strong set of (mostly) laid back afternoon jams, with audiences slow-roasting under the intense summer sun. While we can only hope that last night's storm killed this past week's heat wave, we know we can expect to see more un-ironic Nirvana T-shirts, stylish undercuts and Lennon-gazing bottle sunglasses as the current love for '90s signifiers roars back in full force. </p>

<p>Like in previous years, the festival divided its acts across three stages and, also just like every other year, crowds sought refuge more often than not in the shaded, 15-degrees-cooler Blue Stage, the smallest of the three and placed in the corner of Union Park tucked behind the long row of beverage tents, Port-O-Potties, and local food vendors. -<em>Mike Bellis</em></p>
        <p><img alt="9329281104_6f302d0a32.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/9329281104_6f302d0a32.jpg" width="500" height="332" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Blue Stage Crowd by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p><a href="http://www.missfrankierose.com/">Frankie Rose</a> kicked off the festival at the shaded Blue Stage with a joyful, lilting set of turn of the '90s goth-pop jams, effortlessly combining four-on-the-floor electro beats and Liz Phair-leaning bubblegum pop melodies not too far removed from her former Dum Dum Girls days. Rose herself was decked out in torn stockings, stringy hair and a vintage Cure shirt, announcing sincerely to the crowd that she was more than happy "to be your opening band" for the weekend. The crowd seemed more than happy to have her there, too. Across the park, <a href="http://daughngibson.com/">Daughn Gibson</a>'s signature croon could be heard wafting over thick Euro-beats from the Green stage ("perfect for hot afternoons" -Andrew Huff.) <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>After a short break, LA hardcore collective and <a href="http://www.oddfuture.com/">Odd Future</a> affiliate <a href="http://www.trashtalkhc.com/">Trash Talk</a> did their best to wake up the Blue Stage crowd with their blend of screeching hardcore and metal, asking everyone to "pump their fists" at some point in the middle of the set. This inevitable led to some of the most apathetic audience participation I've ever seen a hardcore band receive, though, to be fair, there were "hella old people" in the audience as frontman Lee Spielman was keen to point out. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><img alt="9326486545_6db5116db3.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/9326486545_6db5116db3.jpg" width="500" height="332" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Mac DeMarco by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>After sitting down to chat with Graham from Wire, we were able to catch some of Mac DeMarco's fuzzed out guitar rock wash over the field. DeMarco's set included some oddly arranged covers of a few Beatles tunes (nothing like hearing someone guttural scream along to a Lennon/McCartney tune) and a nice swampy version of Eric Clapton's "Cocaine." DeMarco set is a prime example of how Pitchfork Festival picks artist that sometimes are under the radar of many, and end up being an enjoyable surprise to happen upon during the weekend. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p>Elsewhere, and as many may have expected, <a href="http://macdemarco.bandcamp.com/">Mac DeMarco</a> easily stole the show with the weekend's first Green Stage set, acquainting his audiences with his brand of oh-so-sexy laid-back jams from his excellent <a href="http://capturedtracks.com/artists/mac-demarco-2/"><i>2</i></a> and even a few terrible/awesome off-the-cuff covers, his band grooving with unhinged tropical guitars and smoked-out charm. DeMarco and his band's effortless charisma painted tracks like "Ode to Viceroy," his paean to cheap Canadian cigarettes, in a casual, conversational tone that attracted a bigger and bigger crowd of onlookers trickling their way into the festival as the afternoon ticked on. His most impressive feat was somehow managing to emerge from a mid-set covers medley of Bad Company, Limp Bizkit and Metallica completely unscathed, winning over the grinning crowds with an ironic wink and some just-sincere-enough showmanship. He even brought out his girlfriend for a slow dance for the set-ending "Still Together." By playing the how-uncool-can-we-get-here game, DeMarco ended up outclassing everyone, of course, and made one of the better first impressions on a Pitchfork crowd as you're likely to see. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><img alt="9329386880_c1e961548c.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/9329386880_c1e961548c.jpg" width="500" height="332" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Mikal Cronin by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>It was at about this point that I realized I was getting seriously sunburned, so I decked out into the <a href="http://chirpradio.org">CHIRP</a> record tent to seek refuge and flip through one vendor's impressive selection of used and unsurprisingly expensive Flying Nun originals ($60 for a Sneaky Feelings record? Yikes.) Newly hydrated and shaded, I made it back to the Blue Stage to catch <a href="http://mikalcronin.bandcamp.com/">Mikal Cronin's</a> set of surfed-up pop ballads, acting the more meditative foil to his friend and often co-conspirator Ty Segall and with his more bubblegum leanings helping him come across like a modern-day of Buddy Holly plus hair. Set up stage right in a tie-dye shirt, Cronin mostly plucked tracks from his Merge debut and second album, <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/store/store_detail.php?catalog_id=929"><i>MCII</i></a>, which sounded a bit too washed out coming through the stage's monitors to really be effective. The crowd seemed satisfied enough, no doubt happy to get their obligatory fix of San Francisco garage pop for the weekend. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p>For those lacking an extensive music history lesson background, <a href="http://www.pinkflag.com/‎">Wire</a> is one of those acts you might have not heard of before, but is likely responsible for influencing one of your favorite bands of all time. The UK post-punk outfit have been around since the mid '70s, pushing the boundaries of minimalistic art punk rock and helping influence the likes of bands from Black Flag to Blur. Their set on the Green stage Friday was a perfect example of the subtle balance between restraint and intensity utilized throughout their catalog. The band (dressed in all black despite the heat and direct sunlight) churned out a tight set of songs that usually started stark and low, rising at the end into a cacophony of abrasive noise. A very finely tuned mathematical rock set and great music history lesson wrapped into one. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p><img alt="9326484851_e27c7142d7.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/transmission/9326484851_e27c7142d7.jpg" width="500" height="345" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;"><em>Bjork by <a href="http://www.joshuamellin.com/">Joshua Mellin</a></em></div></p>

<p>After taking a nap during Joanna Newsom's sleepy and not well amplified set, we moved up close for <a href="http://www.bjork.com/‎">Bjork's</a> headlining set of the night. Despite her pleas of no cameras or video, the crowd clicked away as she emerged onstage, a silver disco ball of a jumpsuit and a headpiece that looked like a dandelion made of Christmas tinsel. Backed by a choir of attractive looking muses, her set started out with an ethereal instrumental blanket that fell across the hushed field. The set bounced around her catalog, starting out with some more delicate songs before amping up the sound during a danceable "Crystalline." She was flanked by video screens projecting different abstract shapes and colors, along with a hanging Tesla coil that was mimicking the electrical charges that were starting to pulsate from the approaching storm in the sky. After back to back beautiful arrangements of "Jóga" and "Pagan Poetry," Bjork launched into the abrasive and raw "Army of Me," one of my personal favorites off my all time favorite Bjork album, <em>Post</em>. Just as it felt like Bjork hit her stride, she sadly announced that due to the severe storms heading our way, her set was coming to an abrupt end. As everyone scattered from the park, our buddy <a href="http://instagram.com/p/b-My7YB6O-/">Conor</a> posted the set list he snagged from the stage, showing that we just missed "Hyperballad" (which is my personal favorite Bjork song) and what would have been a massive dance party of an ending during "Declare Independence." Many were heartbroken, but as a few friends pointed out any Bjork is better than no Bjork, and there is no arguing that fact. <em>-Lisa White</em></p>

<p>The next couple of hours leading up to Bjork's headlining set was a mix of the mostly forgettable (<a href="http://www.pinkflag.com/">Wire</a> were disappointingly staid and played a set of almost completely new material) and the soothing (<a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/joanna-newsom">Joanna Newsom</a>, whose gorgeous voice and soft harp plucking, though lovely, likely made her the only act all weekend having to compete against the noise of passing CTA traincars), leaving plenty of time for the crowds to load up on beer and get situated in front of the Green Stage for the headlining act. Bjork came out to a roaring crowd at about 8:30, decked out in a silver kimono and a silver headdress/afro that bordered on the intimidating. Behind her was a small cult of blonde backup singers, also dressed like avant-garde kabuki dolls, and a scattered band playing grimy and glitchy electro beats, underpinning her evocative, pleading vocals with a sense of menace (and serious low end) that made her songs instantly engaging. Combining trippy spiderweb visuals with lo-fi computer-generated space and environmental imagery, Bjork sang with a fervor and drama that only the threatening heat lighting in the background sky could match, leaving the crowd mesmerized with her challenging sense of wonder and urgency. So much urgency, in fact, that she must have really hit Mother Nature's mainline this time, as the set was called early due to an approaching electrical storm that, yes, less than twenty minutes later had heavy rain, flash floods and has-to-be-nearby lightning strikes scattering the newly drenched and fleeing crowds all up and down Lake and Ashland. A wise move by organizers, no doubt, even if it did end Bjork's set right before she was supposedly about to play "Hyperballad." </p>

<p>Here's hoping for friendlier skies and a heavy dose of sunblock for Saturday. <em>-Mike Bellis</em></p>

        <p>There are usually two ways things can go when opening acts bring the bar down. One, the headliner can seem incredible by comparison to what preceded them; two, it can just wear out an audience. Friday night for <a href="http://savagesband.com/">Savages</a>' Pitchfork aftershow at Lincoln Hall, it seemed things would head in the latter direction for much of the night. But you never know for sure until the end.</p>

<p><a href="http://skyferreira.tumblr.com/">Sky Ferreira</a> kicked off the evening with a delightful set that ran from intimate, downtempo Americana-ish tracks to practically synthpop. Her voice worked with everything she sang, but she had more fun on the uptempo songs when the crowd showed some life. For a young performer, she had a very strong stage presence and appeared to know exactly what she wanted out of her music. At one point, she stopped her guitarist to have him play slower and then started the song all over again to get it right from the start. Her full-length isn't due until 2014, but she has the makeup to break out once it comes around.</p>

<p>As good as her set was, though, what came next was sort of a mess. Björk played a predictably off-beat set of music from her iPhone and Johnny Hostile played 20 minutes of guitar noise followed by ten minutes of atmospherics. Before Savages went on at 12:45, pockets of the crowd had already left and more were grumbling.</p>

<p>Three songs into Savages, it seemed like everyone was on fumes because the band wasn't really connecting with the audience. But then it came together midway through. Jehnny Beth's Ian Curtis-like tics became endearing. Gemma Thompson's intense guitar-playing shined. And the rhythm section was completely in synch on their angular post-punk. The back half from "No Face" until "Husbands" gave the indications that Savages' immense hype isn't overblown. Beth paced the stage, went all in on her Siouxsie Sioux-like vocals and played to the pogoing carousers. When Savages suddenly came to a stop after playing nearly all of their music in 45 minutes, it seemed like they were on the verge of stepping into the next gear. But I guess they left something in the tank for Union Park.</p>

        <h3>Friday highlights</h3>

<p><strong>Frankie Rose</strong> - 3:20pm (Blue)<br />
Gone are the lo-fi days of Brooklyn singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.missfrankierose.com/">Frankie Rose</a>. Frankie was a founding member of two of the hippest girl pop/garage rock groups of the mid-2000s (Dum Dum Girls and Vivian Girls), but after heading off on her own she's turned a completely different direction, now favoring dreamy synths over fuzzy guitars. Successfully changing genres can't be the easiest thing to do, but with the freedom of working solo she's been able to come into her own and reinvent herself as an artist. Frankie opens the festival Friday afternoon and if you can drag yourself out of bed in time to catch her set, you'll be welcomed into Union Park with her gorgeous vocals. If you were into 2012 Pitchfork Fest artists Grimes and Beach House, you won't be regretting the missed sleep.</p>

<p><em>- Stephanie Griffin</em></p>

<p><strong>Daughn Gibson</strong> - 3:30pm (Red)<br />
Do yourself a favor, catch the <a href="http://daughngibson.com/">Daughn Gibson</a> show. You'll be grabbing the tail of Americana's newest jetliner, which should reach cruising altitude by 2014, if not later this year. He's got the makings of a star: Chiseled face. Truck-driver past. The sound of Johnny Cash reincarnate. Like the men of all tall tales, Gibson will soon outgrow his tiny Pennsylvania town and stomp his way across the country, two states in every stride, right into fame and fortune. </p>

<p><em>- Tim Schuler</em></p>

<p><strong>Trash Talk</strong> - 4:15pm (Blue)<br />
<a href="http://www.trashtalkhc.com/">Trash Talk</a> is a hardcore band based out of Sacramento that have been around since 2005 who are known for their volatile stage presence. They recorded their self-titled debut full-length album with Steve Albini back in 2008, They also recorded a single back in 2009, East of Eden, which featured vocals from the former Black Flag leader, Keith Morris. They signed with Odd Future Records back in 2012 and have been touring around with Tyler, the Creator and his crew of rap game absurdists ever since</p>

<p>Trash Talk serve as the antithesis of some the more avant-garde artists performing Pitchfork on Friday, such as Bjork and Joanna Newsom. </p>

<p><em>- Justin Freeman</em></p>

<p><strong>Mac Demarco</strong> - 4:35pm (Green)<br />
<a href="http://macdemarco.bandcamp.com/">Mac Demarco</a> brings his lighthearted, blissfully stoned-out pop tunes to Pitchfork's Green Stage on Friday afternoon, kicking off the main stage with a series of perfectly tuned-up summer jams for the not-yet-hungover-crowd. The Toronto native released <a href="http://capturedtracks.com/artists/mac-demarco-2/"><em>2</em></a> earlier this year, boasting standout tracks like "Ode to Viceroy" and "Cookin' Up Something Good," which is exactly what we expect he'll be doing on Friday. </p>

<p><iframe width="550" height="413" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6bfTTeZOrs4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><em>- Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><strong>Angel Olsen</strong> - 5:15pm (Blue)<br />
<a href="http://angelolsen.com/">Angel Olsen</a> has cultivated countless comparisons to the more haunting, introverted female songwriters of the past, evoking in particular Joni Mitchell at her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5782PQO5is">most fragile</a>. Olsen's tenure in Will Oldham's touring band as a background singer has no doubt permanently affixed a sense of stark mood-making to her dramatic and heart-wrenching songs (and she's even borrowed a bit of his affected warble, too.) We're big fans of Olsen &mdash; be sure to catch her on the Blue stage while we can still call her a Chicago local at 5:15pm.</p>

<p><em>- Mike Bellis</em></p>

<p><strong>Woods</strong> - 5:30pm (Red)<br />
Since the group's creation back in 2005, <a href="http://www.woodsist.com/woods">Woods</a> has released five full-length EPs that have only further cultivated their lo-fi psych-rock sounds. The group began as a solo project for Jeremy Earl, and then grew into a fuller sound backed by many different sound effects. 2009's Song of Shame put the group on the map, as it received numerous accolades. Most recently released was their album Bend Beyond in 2012, released on the group's own label, Woodsist. The eery, psychedelic vocals are backed by hazy, upbeat instrumental backgrounds, a perfect set to ease you into Pitchfork weekend. </p>

<p><em>- Sarah Brooks</em></p>

<p><strong>Mikal Cronin</strong> - 6:15pm (Blue)<br />
Putting in a lot of time in Ty Segall's band can get a person associated with garage rock, punk and psych-rock. But <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/artists/croninmikal">Mikal Cronin</a>'s work in Segall's band doesn't carry over as much into his solo work as one might imagine. His latest, <I>MCII</i>, is a melodic power-pop tour de force that owes more to, say, the Raspberries' penchant for sweet hooks than the delightful fuzz on <i>Slaughterhouse</i>. Cronin played the Empty Bottle last month and should be firing on all cylinders this weekend.</p>

<p><iframe width="550" height="309" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0S2eTV2v3V0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><em>- James Ziegenfus</em></p>

<p><strong>Wire</strong> - 6:25pm (Green)<br />
A band that may be better known for inspiring legions of latter day acolytes, <a href="http://www.pinkflag.com/">Wire</a>'s performance Friday evening will provide Pitchfork's younger attendees the opportunity to see an act that has managed, over almost four decades, to remain iconoclastic, while becoming icons in their own right. Formed in the musical and political melange of mid-70s London, the short version of their bio places them in the early punk firmament, while a closer look and listen reveals a much more complex picture. Lyrically more complex than many of their peers and musically diverse, their first three albums, "Pink Flag," "Chairs Missing" and "154" were hugely influential to a variety of artists who later took music from punk to post-punk, drone and more. The lineup has been somewhat malleable over the years, and long stretches of time passed with members pursuing various side projects, but Wire remains active, as evidenced by this year's <a href="http://pinkflag.greedbag.com/"><em>Change Becomes Us</em></a>, an album that successfully negotiates the line between remaining current and mining a body of work that sprung from a distant counter-cultural British past. A not-to-be missed opportunity to see vibrant living music history.</p>

<p><em>- Dan Snedigar</em></p>

<p><strong>Joanna Newsom</strong> - 7:20pm (Red)<br />
Airy crooner and harpist <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/artists/joanna-newsom">Joanna Newsom</a> brings her audience on melodic journeys through her whimsical sound and often childlike guise. Both can be attributed to her some-what unfeigned music career. She recorded her first two EPs, <em>Walnut Whales</em> and <em>Yarn and Glue</em>, on a Fischer-Price tape recorder. Years later, after much success, including several performances on late-night television, she contributed vocals to "The Muppet Show Theme" in 2011's movie The Muppets. It all boils down to a poetic genre of folk that is truly unlike any other. </p>

<p><em>- Brianna Kelly</em></p>

<p><strong>Bjork</strong> - 8:30pm (Green)<br />
Truly, <a href="http://www.bjork.com">Bjork</a> could be counted as one of Iceland's top exports. The often inscrutable singer isn't exactly who you'd expect to see at Union Park (you'd probably only think about encountering her in magical salt caves or behind enchanted waterfalls on deserted islands) but to those who want a little more fantasy with their indie pop, we all have our fingers crossed that the Icelandic pop princess will bring the strange and wonderful to the nth degree on Friday night. Celebrating 20 years of her post-Sugarcubes solo career (<em>Debut</em> arrived back in 1993), I'm also hoping she brings some of the classic Bjork along for the ride.</p>

<h3>Saturday highlights</h3></p>

<p><strong>White Lung</strong> - 1:00pm (Green)<br />
<a href="http://whitelung.ca/">White Lung</a> is a band that should be easy to pigeonhole, but somehow manages to squirm out of attempts to easily pin them down with simple descriptions. Vancouver, BC-based, the group formed in 2006 as an all-girl punk group, fronted by guitarist/vocalist Mish Way, and solidified it's current lineup when the band's sole male, guitarist Kenny William joined the group in 2009. Comparisons to riot grrrl bands can get you so far, Way's strident vocal style, for instance, but the band's sound is a little different, with a metronomic rhythm section, and a surprisingly intricate and frenetic guitar attack that puts one in mind of mid-60's surf rockers on a speed binge. A band this interesting probably deserves a bigger crowd than their 1:00 Saturday slot will likely garner, but it will be a great opportunity for the day to get off to a blistering start.</p>

<p><iframe width="550" height="309" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8PoQhaNiXvg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><em>- Dan Snedigar</em></p>

<p><strong>Pissed Jeans</strong> - 1:45pm (Red)<br />
On an episode of "Saturday Night Live" from the 1970s, writer/performer Michael O'Donoghue led the cast in a parody of the movie "Casablanca." At one point, while talking with Larraine Newman, he says, "well, sometimes you have to be cruel." "To be kind?," she asks hopefully. "No," he replies, "to be even crueler." Once upon a time, or at least for a short window of time, rock and roll lived by the same rules. This wasn't fun time, it was clobberin' time. Bands like Swans (also on the bill this weekend), Pussy Galore, the Brainbombs and Clockcleaner prove that sometimes, to stay on top of the morass of groups fighting for riff dominance, you have to throw a few rabbit punches. Since 2003, Allentown's <a href="http://www.whitedenim.com/pissedjeans/">Pissed Jeans</a> have bludgeoned their audiences into bliss on albums like <em>Hope For Men</em>, <em>King of Jeans</em>, and 2013's <em>Honeys</em> (all on Sub Pop). The band's nasty snarl is fronted by strangely vulnerable vocals from Matt Korvette, a soft/hard mix the prevents you from dismissing them as merely a bunch of shitty bullies. Pissed Jeans take your sonic milk money, flush your head down the audio toilet, then clean you off and talk with you about how hard it is to talk to girls. Hard to get a read on, and all the better for it. </p>

<p><em>- Chris Sienko</em></p>

<p><strong>Julia Holter</strong> - 1:55pm (Blue)<br />
If you met Julia Holter on the street, you might think she's just another Los Angeles girl. Animated, artsy, says "like" a lot. But Holter's music is surprisingly mature, calling to mind ages past, as if the sounds are the natural reverberations of a reminiscing planet. Which isn't terribly far from the truth. On some recent songs, Holter will make a field recording and then build a song "within it." "I kind of think of it as a collaboration &mdash; I mean, it's not, but...I don't feel like I should get all the credit. There's something else. I couldn't do it on my own."</p>

<p><strong>Phosphorescent</strong> - 2:30pm (Green)<br />
More than ever before, artists today are able to rocket to the top of the charts and become the next big thing before they even release a proper full length album. (<a href="http://www.iconapop.com/">Icona Pop</a>, anybody?) In a world full of hares, rarely do we find a tortoise, but in <a href="http://phosphorescentmusic.com/">Phosphorescent</a> that is exactly what we have. Twelve years after Matthew Houck officially entered the game,  he has finally become a ubiquitous mention among "best of" lists from NPR, Pitchfork, et al. Phosphorescent's 6th full length release, <em>Muchacho</em>, was released earlier this year to much acclaim. Rich in texture, deep in meaning, and somehow also quite catchy, the album brought warmth to a chilly, Chicago spring and created slews of new Phosphorescent fans around the world. The album, which was recorded in Tulum, Mexico, cascades upon listeners ears like morning light flooding a bay window, and watching Phosphorescent dole out tracks from Muchacho and his back catalogue in the brilliant afternoon sun is one of this girl's Pitchfork must-dos.</p>

<p><strong>Parquet Courts</strong> - 2:50pm (Blue)<br />
Brooklyn-via-Texas rockers <a href="http://parquetcourts.wordpress.com/">Parquet Courts</a> call themselves "Americana punk" for their Westward-leaning guitar noodling, but it's probably more of a misleading moniker than anything for those who haven't heard their breakout LP <a href="http://dulltools.bandcamp.com/album/light-up-gold"><em>Light Up Gold</em></a>. Evoking the Odessa-to-Houston open plains feel of 90s indie rock classics like <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-water-mw0000600935"><i>American Water</i></a>, and often pinned under by a sturdy motorik beat (psych/kraut leanings are ever-so-chic, lest we forget), the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs2_OMnkcxE">stoned and starving quartet</a> is sure to be one of the festivals highlights. </p>

<p><strong>...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead</strong> - 3:20pm (Red)<br />
We all know that more isn't always better, but when it comes to drums, two drummers really do mean more fun, and that's especially true for <a href="http://andyouwillknowusbythetrailofdead.bandpage.com">..And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead</a>. They've been playing together since 1994, and recently released their eighth studio album <em>Lost Songs</em>. Their albums have ebbed and flowed with effectiveness, but their latest work still bursts open like popcorn at times and will sure to fire up the afternoon crowd on Saturday. Check out a video for their latest album's title track, below:</p>

<p><strong>Merchandise</strong> - 3:45pm (Blue)<br />
Merchandise honed their craft in Florida's DIY scene, playing house shows and recording in what sounded like a tin can. But over time the band developed the sound that'd define them in 2013 &mdash; a melting pot of new wave, rock and jazz signatures, and plenty of noise. On this year's <i>Totale Nite</i> album, they sound refined yet uninhibited. In January at Schubas they were flat with a guitar, bass and drum machine. But a few months ago they added a live drummer and an extra guitar. The songs come across meaty and intense, matching the atmosphere on their last two records. They'll be primed for Pitchfork. (Merchandise also headlines an <a href="http://bottomlounge.com/events-archive/merchandise-daughn-gibson-connections-steve-gunn/">aftershow</a> at Bottom Lounge with Daughn Gibson on Friday night.)</p>

<p><strong>Ryan Hemsworth</strong> - 5:45pm (Blue)<br />
<a href="http://www.ryanhemsworth.com/">Ryan Hemsworth</a> seems to be on the cusp of a promising career. The 22 year old from Halifax, Nova Scotia, has been making a name for himself with original releases and unofficial (but well-recieved) remixes of artists like Grimes and Frank Ocean, and has recently begun to work with American hip-hop luminaries, a move that reinforces the fundamentals of his carefully crafted laptop anthems. Ethereal is a description that comes to mind, but the composition is solidly muscular beneath the shimmering layers of sound. Hemsworth is an artist at a bit of a crossroads, but for now he's making extremely well-thought out sample-based electronica while moving towards producing some of what could be the most intelligent hip-hop of the next few years.</p>

<p><strong>The Breeders</strong> - 6:15pm (Green)<br />
Two words: Reunion tour. It's been twenty years since the Breeders released Last Splash, the record that secured them a spot in the ranks of '90s alt rock alongside Pixies and Sleater-Kinney. All four original members are touring for the first time since the summer of 1994, and if, like me, you missed good '90s music when the '90s were actually happening, see the Breeders for a slice of musical history &mdash; you might enjoy it more than you think. </p>

<p><strong>Low</strong> - 6:45pm (Blue)<br />
Indie rock trio <a href="http://www. http://chairkickers.com/">Low</a> infers loaded feelings through minimalistic music. The band recently worked with Wilco's Jeff Tweedy at the Loft studio in Chicago for its tenth album, <em>The Invisible Way</em>. Low utilizes slow tempos to lead into its vocal-heavy songs. Low isn't likely to put on the most electrifying performance, but it might be the perfect show to catch if you feel like taking a break from raging to chill with some food or a drink. </p>

<p><em>- Brianna Kelly</em></p>

<p><strong>Solange</strong> - 7:45pm (Red)<br />
Starting off as Beyonce's sister can run the risk of lurking back in her shadows, however, <a href="http://www.solangemusic.com/#/">Solange</a> has come a long way throughout her career, and has separated herself from her sister's fame to make a name for herself that is all her own. Solange began her public singing career at age five when she sang in front of a crowd at an amusement park. She then would frequently open up for Destiny's Child as they toured, or appear as a backup dancer. One can see her evolution throughout her career as she has frequently re-invented her image. From her first album, Solo Star, Solange shines with soulful R&B ballads. Emerging as Sol-Angel in 2010, her sophomore album is saturated with soul through and through. Her latest album released in 2012 after teaming up with Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor's label, True, shines as something completely different than she has ever created before. Funky rhythms and retro beats complement the soulful pop ballads. Her evolution will no doubt be showcased for Pitchfork's crowd on Saturday evening, and it will be a great show to watch just how far she has come through her years of artistry.</p>

<p><strong>Andy Stott</strong> - 7:45pm (Blue)<br />
Though it was released in November of last year, new ears have only recently been finding their way to <a href="http://www.modern-love.co.uk/artists/andy-stott">Andy Stott</a>'s <em>Luxury Problems</em> (Modern Love) album in large numbers. Stott, a versatile producer/performer active for almost a decade, seems to have reached a high-water mark with this album, weaving dreamy washes of unidentifiable electro-sound and fine-grain atmospheric details into a woozy mixture that suggests Lush as easily as Porter Ricks. It's anybody's guess whether the notoriously muddy Pitchfork sound system will adequately capture Stott's sumptuous and subtle sonics, but if they do, prepare yourself for an epiphany you'll be trying in vain to explain to your co-workers for the next six months. </p>

<p><strong>Rustie</strong> - 8:45pm (Blue)<br />
<a href="http://rustie.net/">Rustie</a> is a electronic composer based out of Glasgow who is known for his rave inducing maximalistic sound. It's sped up pop mixed with slowed down bombastic rap, and all of this is filtered through a relentless hyper kineticism that makes you feel like you're hanging out after middle school at your favorite sketchy arcade in the late 90's (RIP Fun Harbor.)</p>

<p>The last few years have been kind to Rustie. With the 1-2 punch of his infamous <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rustie/essential-mix-bbc-radio-1">BBC Essential Mix</a> and the release of his album Glass Swords, he has quickly built a reputation as a force to be reckoned with. As the headliner for the blue stage Saturday night, Rustie finds himself going against the far more sombre Belle & Sebastian who headline the main stage that night. Check out his single, "After Light."</p>

<p><strong>Belle & Sebastian</strong> - 8:30pm (Green)<br />
The original idea sounds so simple &mdash; record some music in college and press it as part of a music business course. Thousands of people have done that. But how many of those albums then went on to be critically acclaimed off-campus and even by the country's fervent music press? <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com">Belle & Sebastian</a> started out as a project for school and grew into a band that's been lauded for their sugary indie-pop, well-crafted songs and clever lyrics. Over the years, frontman Stuard Murdoch has transformed from shy to extroverted on stage and is the catalyst for getting thousands of people to be delighted at their shows. Belle & Sebastian's supposedly been asked to play this festival numerous times and this weekend they'll finally show why organizers have been so adamant about them playing.</p>

<h3>Sunday highlights</h3></p>

<p><strong>Tree</strong> - 1:00pm (Green)<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/MCTREEG">Tree</a> is a rapper-producer based here in Chicago. A refugee of the recently demolished Cabrini Green projects, Tree finds himself navigating a musical landscape somewhere in between Chief Keef's scientific nihilism and Chance the Rapper's backpacker revivalism while resembling this generation's answer to David Banner.</p>

<p>Tree recently released the mixtape, "<a href="http://www.thefader.com/2013/05/15/download-trees-sunday-school-ii-mixtape/">Sunday School II: When School Lets Out</a>" to general acclaim. It is full of musical samples that immerse the listener into childhood recollections of the drive home from church on a summer Sunday afternoon while listening to deep cuts from Stax in your stylish uncle's Cadillac combined with trunk rattling 808 snares popularized by rappers such as the Three 6 Mafia. Tree kicks things off on Sunday at 1pm. Check out his single, "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/mctreeg/safe-to-say-prod-by-tye-hill-2">Safe to Say</a>."</p>

<p><strong>Foxygen</strong> - 1:45pm (Red)<br />
Boy meets boy. Boys share mutual love for rockumentary <em>Dig!</em> and bond over Rolling Stones vinyl listening sessions. Boys form band. So goes the charming story of <a href="http://www.jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=foxygen">Foxygen</a>, the ratty-haired youthful duo from Los Angeles. Borrowing heavily from rock and roll's grandfathers, Foxygen has created some of the most unique music 2013 has had to offer. They differentiate themselves from the mess of youngsters occupying Pitchfork's lineup this year by neglecting the synthesizer and instead prioritizing the sounds of the Stones, the Velvet Underground, and the Kinks. They are rock and roll purists, with Sam French even claiming in a Pitchfork interview that he, "doesn't even know any new bands," and that he, "can't relate to modern music very well." A curious sentiment coming from a 22 year old. While many of Foxygen's merits are arguable (and oft-discussed on Twitter), some aren't. Particularly their breakout debut album, "We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic." The album is a feast for the ears and though the boys are yet to master the art of live performances, Pitchfork offers a renewed opportunity for them to get serious about their sound. </p>

<p><strong>Autre Ne Veut</strong> - 1:55pm (Blue)<br />
<a href="http://www.autreneveut.com/">Autre Ne Veut</a> began as an anonymous project for singer/songwriter Arthur Ashin, but with his latest release <em>Anxiety</em>, the artist is finally coming out of the woodwork. This next level R & B album is filled with the singer's stunning emotive falsetto and is quickly becoming one of the musical highlights of 2013. In French, Autre Ne Veut translates to "I think of none other," fitting for his perfectly seductive bedroom songs. These mellow grooves will work well with your Sunday morning hangover.</p>

<p><em>- Stephanie Griffin</em></p>

<p><strong>El-P</strong> - 3:20pm (Red)<br />
Rapper, producer, raconteur <a href="http://www.definitivejux.net/">El-P</a> isn't one to mindlessly churn out product. Since disbanding Company Flow in 2000, he's produced only three full-length albums with lyrics (along with a generous helping of instrumentals, remixes, and DJ mixes both for himself and other artists, most notably his amazing work with Cannibal Ox). <em>Fantastic Damage</em> (2002) was a state of the union after 9/11. <em>I'll Sleep When You're Dead</em> (2007) is one of hip hop's most stinging rebukes to the Bush era (check out the minute-long "Dear Sirs" for the most concentrated dose of corrosive acid), and 2012's <em>Cancer4Cure</em> (released, auspiciously enough, on the blues label Fat Possum) wailed through the malignancies that haunt us today, including tracks like "Drones Over Brooklyn" and "Tougher Colder Killer." El's beats are the closest thing hip hop has to a crossover with old-guard industrial music (pre-NIN), using noise, distortion and martial severity to hammer home his joyless urban dystopias. Live, El does leave some room for puttin' the old hands in the air, but not much. This is music to nod your head to ruefully, setting your jaw and pumping your fist in solidarity. This Pitchfork set announces a fourth (!) new release, a collaboration with Killer Mike entitled <a href="http://foolsgoldrecs.com/runthejewels/"><em>Run the Jewels</em></a>. Could the Terrence Malik of hip hop be entering a new zone of both creativity and prolificacy? Heads everywhere are aching for a yes. </p>

<p><em>- Chris Sienko</em></p>

<p><strong>Yo La Tengo</strong> - 4:15pm (Green)<br />
Unlike many of this group's Pitchfork predecessors over the weekend, <a href="http://www.yolatengo.com">Yo La Tengo</a> has been playing music together for a long time and have become indie rock darlings during their reign. Their first album, Fakebook, was released back in 1990. Since then, they've released numerous albums that showcase their indie rock flair. Their music frequently features low-fi feedback effects, upbeat piano riffs, tender ballads and a range of different effects. There's something in their immense catalogue that can appeal to everyone if they're looking for it. Ranging from the melancholy, to the more mercurial, to the elated, their songs have told stories for the past 23 years as they've adapted to the changing music scene and still retained a solid fan base. Make sure to check them out on Sunday as they delve into their material, sure to play both old and new favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Sky Ferreria</strong> - 4:45pm (Blue)<br />
Synth-pop has found a new princess in the precocious <a href="http://skyferreira.tumblr.com/">Sky Ferreira</a>. A millennial through and through, Sky grew up idolizing Britney Spears and uploading songs to her Myspace account. It was there that she was discovered by swedish producers Bloodshot and Avant who took her under their wing and begin fitting her for synthy stardom. Between then and now Sky released a few EPs and some forgotten clubbangers like "One" and the bass-dropping "Sexrules"  and worked with a variety of different producers before finally settling on Dev Hynes and Ariel Rechtshaid who helped stitch together her praiseworthy EP <em>Ghost</em> which was released back in October. Ever since then, it's been a waiting game for her delayed and then delayed again debut album to drop. Only then will there be more to say about Sky Ferreira who has brought much joy to people all over the world with the self-effacing and delightful "Everything is Embarrassing" and then left them hanging, hungry for more. Rumor has it, Ferreira fans will now have to wait until 2014 for a full length album but to quote Sky's Twitter bio, "it's like, whatever." </p>

<p><strong>Lil B</strong> - 5:15pm (Red)<br />
Have you ever "ironically" jammed out to Miley Cyrus, Ke$ha, or Katy Perry and then realized that you actually have a completely genuine affection for these artists? This phenomenon is responsible for pretty much the entirety of <a href="http://www.basedworld.com/">Lil B</a>'s cult fan base. Known as "The Based God," Lil B is possibly the only artist on Pitchfork's bill that has his own page on Know Your Meme. His strategy seems to have been quantity over quality, as he originally gained attention after creating over 100 separate MySpace accounts under his name to promote his music, later moving to Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube. He's released 7 albums and 45 mixtapes over the past few years and none of them are particularly that good, but there's something endearing about him that has drawn people in. I'm still not sure if he's serious or if he's in on the joke. Catch him Sunday evening and decide for yourself.</p>

<p><em>- Stephanie Griffin</em></p>

<p><strong>Toro Y Moi</strong> - 6:15pm (Green)<br />
Ok, it's getting late in the day, just a few hours left in the festival and your mind is as tired as your feet (though hopefully not as filthy). What's the remedy? A cold drink, a snack, and a little time spent relaxing to the beats of <a href="http://www.toroymoi.com">Toro Y Moi</a>. All this good chillwave comes from just one man, recording artist and producer Chazwick Bradley Bundick, who hails from South Carolina. His latest album, <em>Anything in Return</em>, came out earlier this year, and continues his tradition of cool synth loops paired with house influences sure to please a weary Chicago crowd.</p>

<p><strong>MIA</strong> - 7:35pm (Red)<br />
Though British singer/rapper <a href="http://www.miauk.com">MIA</a> many not be as present on the music scene as she was when "Boyz" and "Paper Planes" dropped in 2007, she is still a force to be reckoned with. Her wide-ranging sound, which combines elements of hip-hop, dance, electronic, and world music, has won the hearts of fans and music critics alike. She touts two Grammys and the appointment as one of the ten defining artists of the 2000's decade by Rolling Stone. Hell, she can even be credited with giving her ex-boyfriend, the massively popular electronic producer, Diplo his start. She'll "Bring the Noize" with a high-energy performance during the second to last set on the main stage, before R. Kelly closes out the festival.</p>

<p><iframe width="550" height="309" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2uYs0gJD-LE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><em>- Brianna Kelly</em></p>

<p><strong>R. Kelly</strong> - 8:30pm (Green) <br />
Either out of intrigue or adoration, people are talking about <a href="http://www.r-kelly.com/">R. Kelly</a>. The Chicago crooner's performance has stoked excitement throughout the city and provided big name buzz for the festival whose previous headliners have typically eschewed Top 40 fame. Unfortunately for Kelly, the past half decade has been one of relative obscurity preceded by an infamous underage urination scandal that anyone who was half conscious during the year 2002 heard about. Then again the obscurity has been just that...relative. To those who have been watching more closely, Kelly has had quite the respectable career since the drama ebbed. Continuing to write and produce all of his own music, Kelly released well-received album after well-received album and acquired another grammy nomination for his throwback album, <em>Love Letter</em>. To say he's had a blessed career would be quite a humble summary of the 54 million albums that he has sold and the three Grammys that he has won. And to assume that he is nothing more than a washed up soul artist who will soon be playing casinos would be naive to say the least. As R. Kelly put it on his track "Shut Up," "See my future ain't my past/ it's not the end of the hourglass/ who said it would not last?" Attendees should consider R. Kelly's Pitchfork concert less of a "comeback concert" &mdash; as its been dubbed by some in the blogosphere &mdash; and more of a "I never went anywhere" performance. A reintroduction of sorts to all those who have forgotten just how sweet Kelly sounds, just how much he inspires.</p>
