        <p><img alt="Cubs_200.png" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Cubs_200.png" width="200" height="200" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />In the winter of 2006, former general manger Jim Hendry set out to fill what he, along with many in the industry, considered to be the missing piece for the Cubs to reach the playoffs and beyond. His goal: sign a leadoff hitter -- regardless of price. On November 21st, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2668465">he inked the most expensive contract</a> for a top of the order bat in the history of baseball. Soon to be 31-year-old Alfonso Soriano was coming to the Cubs for a cool $136 million over eight years.</p>

<p>Soriano had just completed <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/soriaal01.shtml">his best season as a major leaguer</a>, becoming just the fourth player in the history of baseball to hit <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hi4040c.shtml">40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same year</a> (ironically, he'll be teaming up with another in Alex Rodriguez -- a player he was also traded for in his career). In his six full seasons, he had never played less than 145 games. The expectations that came along with the $136 million were astronomical. And that's where the problems started.</p>

<p>The mid-2000s was a time of transition in Major League Baseball. Getting on base and drawing walks, especially at the top of the lineup, was quickly becoming a talking point for anyone familiar with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-The-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818">Michael Lewis's bestseller "Moneyball"</a>. Soriano didn't draw many walks and the organization had to continuously beat back the idea of moving him down in the order. Hendry paid for his stolen bases too, not just his homers. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=soriaal01&t=b&year=2009">It wasn't until July 4th of 2009</a> that Soriano was freed from the leadoff spot.</p>
        <p>His first season in Chicago was fantastic from a hitting perspective. The triple slash line of .299/.337/.560 with 42 homers and 19 steals was good enough for <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2007.shtml#NLmvp">12th in the MVP voting</a>. But two problems started creeping up in the summer of 2007. Soriano only managed to play in just 135 games, the fewest of his career to that point, and he started hearing it from the fans in left field for his poor defense along with annoying bunny hop he did when making catches in the outfield. <a href="http://www.city-data.com/forum/chicago/633250-sorianos-hop-step.html">It infuriated people</a>.</p>

<p>Soriano played second base during his first five major league seasons, but was so brutal at the position that the Nationals moved him out to left field in an effort to minimize his defensive ineptness. He had never played there before in his life, but Cubs fans didn't care. He was being paid a ton of money; errors and silly mistakes were unacceptable.</p>

<p>Worse yet, he continued to have problems staying on the field. In 2008, despite good hitting numbers when he played (.280, 29 homers, 19 steals), <a href="http://blogs.chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports_hardball/2008/04/sorianos-hop-ge.html">leg injuries</a> started to <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/card/card.php?id=1608">rob him of more and more games</a> -- not to mention his speed. He suited up for only 109 contests that season, and didn't break double digits in steals again during a single season <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA201307080.shtml">until just a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>He seemingly swung and missed at every breaking ball in the dirt too, and Cubs fans were fed up. The injuries, the lack of power, not getting on base, sub-par defense, and the strikeouts all weighed on him. He was booed frequently at Wrigley Field, and that's tough to hear from a home crowd.</p>

<p>When Theo Epstein was hired in the winter of 2011, he began to <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/04/17/bernstein-cubs-culture-changing-for-the-better/">write a new culture for the Cubs organization</a>. The future he had everyone envisioning was one that clearly didn't involve Soriano. From the moment Epstein signed, the Soriano trade watch began, and <a href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2012/07/31/alfonso-soriano-reportedly-tells-cubs-he-wont-go-to-san-francisco-in-trade/">might've ended a year earlier if not for the no-trade clause</a> Hendry threw in to sweeten the original contract -- <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/cubs-talk/cubs-now-no-more-no-trade-clauses?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">something that Epstein doesn't believe in</a>.</p>

<p>Soriano wasn't being dealt because people in the organization didn't like him though. In fact, he's <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceMiles2112/status/360557367164796930">considered one of the best teammates</a> and people in all of baseball. That sentiment is pretty clear from the reactions of the front office, manager, and his teammates upon the news of him being traded back to where his Major League career began.</p>

<p>With the spotlight shined on the Cubs future under the new regime, Soriano went out and quietly put together a great season in 2012, and was doing the same so far this year. <a href="http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9511031/alfonso-soriano-traded-new-york-yankees-chicago-cubs">Being traded for a pitcher</a> in low-A and getting the Yankees to pay roughly $7 million of the $24.5 million remaining on his contract isn't because the Cubs didn't want him anymore. Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer wanted to give Soriano another shot at a title before his career is over. They also wanted the roster spot to see if <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-curious-case-of-junior-lake/">younger players like Junior Lake</a> could hack it in the majors with proper playing time.</p>

<p>With Soriano's departure, the book has also officially closed on the Hendry years. If you ask the average Cubs fan, they'll say that Soriano didn't deliver on that monster deal he signed in 2006. But the reality is that he did. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=847&position=2B/OF">According to Fangraphs</a>, Soriano's Wins Above Replacement (WAR) during his time in Chicago was 18.9. At the going rate of wins being worth roughly $5.5 million, Soriano provided nearly $104 million in value during his Cubs career. To date, he's been paid roughly $111.5 million. It doesn't get much closer than that for nine-figure contracts.</p>

<p>Soriano improved his outfield defense every season as well. <a href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2010/04/19/alfonso-soriano-will-finally-stop-that-stupid-hop/">He ditched the bunny hop after errors</a>, injury and fan rage, hit homers like he was supposed to, and ran when his legs allowed. And there<a href="http://wapc.mlb.com/play?content_id=22855215"> wasn't anything more fun than to watch him peg runners</a> at second, third, and home with his trademark tailing throws from deep in left field. He lived up to the money he was paid, and did it while being berated by fans <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/04/21/cubs-announcer-bob-brenly-rips-alfonso-soriano/">and media members</a>. When the heat wasn't on him in the last couple years, he even developed a good relationship with his former detractors in left field -- maybe because they knew his days were numbered. He was the <a href="https://twitter.com/lenandjd/status/360570867148791809">consummate professional</a>: He worked hard, <a href="https://twitter.com/JulioBorbon20/status/360634933678571520">was a fantastic teammate</a>, and always answered the questions he was asked.</p>

<p>Instead of remembering him for not living up to unrealistic expectations, let's remember him for what he was: worth the money.</p>

        <p><img alt="Cubs_200.png" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Cubs_200.png" width="200" height="200" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />In the past two years, the Cubs have become quite familiar with the minor league system of the Texas Rangers. After swinging a deadline deal last year <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8218905/texas-rangers-land-chicago-cubs-ryan-dempster">that sent Ryan Dempster to Arlington</a> for a package that included this year's <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=milb&t=p_pbp&pid=543294">Southern League All-Star starting pitcher Kyle Hendricks</a>, the Cubs followed it up less than a year later <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/9500209/source-texas-rangers-agree-deal-matt-garza-chicago-cubs">by dealing Matt Garza</a>, the hottest available starter on the market, for a package of four or five players, including top third base prospect Mike Olt.</p>

<p>Judging trades that involve a number of prospects is incredibly hard to do the day it happens. The hope is that the return is a healthy combination of quantity and quality when you're dealing what many consider the top player that is readily available on the market.</p>

<p>Here's what we do know, however. Whichever team traded for Garza was <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4902309/trade-reaction-high-price-but-rangers-had-to-pay">receiving a two month rental</a>, and no more. Unless an extension is negotiated as part of the deal, then two months and roughly 12 starts is all you can count on. If you need proof of that, look no further than Dempster and Texas just last season. If all goes as planned, maybe a few extra starts in postseason play can be expected as well. So that's what the Cubs traded. A starter they weren't going to sign to a long-term extension because they didn't want to commit enough years/cash for a pitcher that's widely considered a number two or three starter to go along with an injury history that makes general managers wake up in pools of sweat if he's signed long term.</p>
        <p>In return, the Cubs appear to have gotten both significant quantity and quality -- exactly as hoped. Olt is the highlight when it comes to quality in the deal. Before the 2013 season, he was a <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8891538/mlb-top-100-prospects-2012-jurickson-profar-dylan-bundy-more">consensus</a> <a href="https://www.baseballamerica.com/blog/prospects/2013/02/2013-top-100-prospects-list/">Top 100</a> <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=19694">prospect in baseball</a>, and second in the Rangers system behind recently promoted super-prospect Jurickson Profar.</p>

<p>He's a 24-year-old true third basemen that would easily rank as a plus defender at the position. He's also got raw power in pro ball that make scouts drool, drilling 28 homers in 95 games at double-A last season. His big problem (along with many Cubs prospects) is whether or not he'll make enough contact to see that power shine through.</p>

<p>After a miserable April that involved him battling <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130531&content_id=49208732&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb">vision problems from a tear duct issue</a> in his right eye (which he believes was caused by a concussion he sustained in the Dominican Winter League last November), followed by missing the entire month of May, Olt has bounced back to hit <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?t=p_pbp&pid=592609">.247 with 10 homers in the months of June and July</a>. In reference to his contact rates -- those numbers have yet to improve with his eyesight -- striking out 57 times in 158 at bats since his return. He's also drawn 26 walks during that time, but the offensive numbers aren't what you'd hope from a top tiered prospect in the hitter friendly Pacific Coast League. He'll continue his work in Iowa for the remainder of the season, but could begin the 2014 season as the Cubs starting third basemen, with Luis Valbuena making a move to second. He still has room to grow, having only recorded less than two full seasons of at bats in the minor leagues.</p>

<p>Soon to be 25-year-old Justin Grimm is a command specialist that won't blow anyone away (averaging 91-92 on his fastball), and probably won't be any more than a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle relief pitcher because he only throws two pitches well (fastball and curve). <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=11720&position=P">He's had 3-to-1 and 4-to-1 strikeout-to-walk</a> ratios in the minor leagues before, but that number is inflated by the fact that he rarely walks anyone. Well, except for this season, where he's allowed 31 free passes in 89 innings to go along with a scary 6.37 ERA. The Cubs are hoping the easier National League will be a good change of pace, and hope they can help him develop a third pitch that allows him to get lefties out. He'll begin his work in Iowa as well.</p>

<p>CJ Edwards is the lottery ticket portion of the trade that is pretty typical of deals that involve top tier players. Edwards has been flying up the radars of front offices around baseball <a href="https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/359424175435300864">according to Buster Olney</a>, while other scouts like <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfessorParks/status/359426736976441345">Jason Parks from Baseball Prospectus believe</a> he's a number four a five starter with a chance at being an impact reliever. He's dominated low-A this season to the tune of <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?sid=milb&t=p_pbp&pid=605218">122 Ks in just 93.1 innings</a> to go along with just 34 walks and a 1.38 ERA. <a href="http://vimeo.com/45291830">He throws a good fastball up to 95</a> with a solid curveball and developing changeup.</p>

<p>If two of those guys ended up working out for the Cubs, it would be a pretty amazing haul for a guy that had no future in Chicago. But they not only got the three guys named above, the North Siders will also receive one or two players to be named later that are on a list the teams have exchanged. One of the names is Neil Ramirez, another Top 15 prospect in the Rangers system who was rumored as the piece that derailed the deal between the two teams late last week because of his durability concerns.</p>

<p>For a team that isn't shy about the fact they're rebuilding, the Cubs pulled w<a href="https://twitter.com/DCameronFG/status/359424457967804416">hat appears to be a great return</a> from a team in desperate need of a quality starter. It's a theme that has been consistent from Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer since coming to Chicago in late 2011, and pretty soon we'll be able to fully judge them for the prospects they've acquired since then.</p>

The organization has a league-high five players invited to the Canadian team with Jonathan Toews, Duncan Keith, Patrick Sharp, Brent Seabrook and Corey Crawford getting the call. Camp for Team Canada will be in Calgary in August with 42 other Canadians hoping to make the squad.</p>

<p>Three other members of the Blackhawks have been invited to the United States Men's Hockey Team with Conn Smythe winner Patrick Kane, Nick Leddy and Brandon Saad getting the honor. The three Hawks players will head to Arlington, VA, on August 26 and 27. They will join 45 other U.S.-born players in hopes to make Team USA.</p>
        <p>The 2010 Olympics in Vancouver featured six Blackhawks players who made the trip to the northwest with Toews, Keith and Seabrook representing Canada; Kane for Team USA; Marian Hossa and Tomas Kopecky for Team Slovakia. Canada beat the United States for the Gold Medal by the final of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_P099mKmSM">3-2 in overtime</a>.</p>

<p>With the NHL approving of its players being eligible for Olympic play in 2014, the <a href="http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/schedule.htm">Hawks' 2013-14 schedule</a> contains only five games in February, all of which will be on the road. The NHL will break from February 9 until February 26, with hockey beginning in the Olympics on February 12 and ending with the Gold Medal game on February 23.</p>

<p>No word yet on other Hawks players being invited to their respective countries for camp.</p>

<p><img alt="com_130218_espnw_jpeg_replace.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/com_130218_espnw_jpeg_replace.jpg" width="200" height="100" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />This summer espnW is celebrating Title IX, the federal law that has provided girls and women access to athletic programs, with nine films. One film, "Let Them Wear Towels," which premiered July 16, documented the rise of the woman sports journalist and their biggest hurdle to success -- the locker room.</p>

<p>Today we don't bat an eye to see journalists, like NBC Chicago's Peggy Kusinski, grab an athlete right after the game and pepper them with questions. Sometimes she's in the locker room, sometimes she's on the sideline. She goes where she needs to get the story. And that is exactly why in the 1970s and '80s women sports journalists fought to gain access to the sweatiest and grossest place in sports. Earlier this year, WBEZ's Cheryl Raye Stout <a href="http://www.wbez.org/blogs/cheryl-raye-stout/2013-01/super-bowl-will-have-reporter-turned-fan-next-sunday-105137">proclaimed her gratitude</a> to former Chicago Bear Jim Harbaugh for questioning the policy to not let women into locker rooms. If we had to rank the feminist battles of the 20th Century, and some people like to do that, this might not be in the top 10. But it no less important than other glass ceilings that continue to be shattered.</p>

<p>I had the honor to speak to award-winning journalist Christine Brennan about the early part of her career, what the future holds for women sports journalists and how young women can take inspiration from her generation's battle.</p>
        <p><strong>I have to say that I watched what your generation had to endure in the locker rooms and am in awe. The poise you had in the face of some awful treatment and harassment is inspiring.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks, there were times when I would be the only woman in the press box. But most of the women in the film were ahead of me by a few years, five to seven years. They opened a lot of doors for me. I personally do not have any horror stories, at least not like what the other women went through. I was pretty lucky. In fact, I often I didn't notice I was the only woman. I wasn't looking for it. I was honestly blissfully ignorant that I might be the only woman in the press box. I was so focused on my job, that nothing was getting in my way. It was the men who would usually be the ones who pointed it out to me.</p>

<p><strong>"Let Them Wear Towels" is set in the 1970s and '80s, yet there are still fields where women still feel as one of the few women. What message could today's young women in those fields, especially science and engineering, take away from this documentary to help them with their lives?</strong></p>

<p>I feel that if you have naivete and gumption, if you can combine those two then you got what you need. You can't always sweat the small stuff. Continue to do your job and hopefully do it very well. The women in the film were my mentors. You can see that they had great spirit and that nothing was going to stop them. This film is about winning. We won! If you can persevere, you will be fine. You are on the correct side of the issue. Inclusion will always win.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, this film is about a huge win. BUT... to what extent are the highest echelons of sports journalism still a boys' club?</strong></p>

<p>I was just at the <a href="http://awsmonline.org/2013-convention/">Association of Women in Sports Media conference</a> that just happened. It was the 25th anniversary conference and had the largest turnout. That said, it certainly would be wonderful to have more women as sports editors and directors. Billie Jean King likes to remind us that we need to be charge. I do want to point out that the largest circulated sports section is at <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/usa-today-names-sports-managing-editor_b57923">USA Today and our editor is Mary Byrne<br />
</a>! But we can still do better. With that in mind, we need to remember that budget constraints are hindering the hiring of women sports journalists. We will get there, but it will take time.</p>

<p><strong>What responsibility do you believe women sports journalists have to women's sports?</strong></p>

<p>For me, I cover far more men's sports than women's sports. But I did calculate my work for 2012, 25% columns were about women and that was in 2012 an Olympic year. Olympic years always see an upswing in reporting on women's sports. I do see myself as being aware of what is happening, alerting editors and writing about it. But I am not a promoter of only the good news. No one was more critical of Tonya Harding or Marion Jones than I was. I do not promote women's sports, but I do cover them. When I was at the Washington Post, every year they covered the men's US Open, but not the women's US Open. I went to my editor, pointed this out and he agreed that we should cover it, so I went. Over the year, eventually the golf writer took over the coverage, which was a good thing. When they're not writing glowing pieces, but covering the event. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2012/10/24/christine-brennan-geno-auriema-us-womens-soccer/1654413/">I did express my disappointment</a> in men coaching women's sports, <a href="https://twitter.com/cbrennansports/status/263390005035151360">especially when US Soccer hired a man as a head coach</a>. He's a great guy, but his hiring sends the wrong message. The US women's soccer team is the most visible team and to have a man as head coach, when we have plenty of qualified woman after generations of them playing and coaching soccer, it is just the wrong message. Girls who look up to players like Alex Morgan should see her being coached by a woman.</p>

<p><strong>It is clear that there is a strong sense that one needs to be beautiful to get a broadcast job, even in sports. I was watching a sports talk show and half of the men were very schleppy looking -- wrinkled polos, beer guts, not clean shaven. When will we get women on sports shows that look like that?</strong></p>

<p>I hope we don't, cause that's gross! I have to say that we're closer than people think to seeing parity in sports talk shows, including having women who are not traditionally beautiful. Yes, we see beautiful women on the sidelines and I root for them. And I am especially rooting that when they are 50, that they are doing as much TV as they are now. I do not have beauty pageant looks, but I am doing more TV now in my 50s than ever before.</p>

<p>I know that I am getting all this TV not because of looks, but talent, brains, and opinions. Looks come and go, but you can't lose your brains, smarts, talent.  We have been blinded by some hiring -- but I still root for them -- but I really think we are almost there at parity. Just look at all the veteran women who are thriving on air. I think you need to be smart to be on TV. Sure, we still love good-looking people, male or female, but sports is welcoming of veterans too, the not-so and good-looking.</p>

        <p>The Chicago Outfit's b-team, the Shade Brigade, took home a win Saturday against the Ohio Roller Girls' b-team, the Gang Green.</p>

<p>The Shade Brigade held Gang Green scoreless for the first eight minutes of the bout, jumping out to a 29-0 lead. But Gang Green went on a 51-0 run to take the lead from the Shade Brigade. At the half, the Shade Brigade led 99-60.</p>
        <p>The second half was all Shade Brigade. Though Gang Green did manage to chip away at the Shade Brigade's lead, Shade Brigade jammers seemed to find every hole in Gang Green's defense and won the bout 199-128.</p>

<p>"I think we did a really good job keeping our walls tight," the Shade Brigade's Smashtag said after the bout.</p>

<p>Shade Brigade jammer Graves sprained her knee with 6:21 left in the game and did not return to the track.</p>

<p>The Outfit's a-team, the Syndicate, did not fare as well, losing to the Ohio's a-team, the All Stars, 273-107.</p>

<p>Syndicate jammer Queefer Sutherland said after the bout that Ohio's blocking made it difficult to score points.</p>

<p>"They were so physical," she said. "They block with their entire bodies and they recycle like crazy."</p>

<p>She said the Syndicate needs to do better at keeping their jammers out of the penalty box and said they were called for a lot of track cutting penalties Saturday.</p>

<p>"I'm curious to know what the score would have been if not for the power jams," she said. </p>

<p>Saturday's victory meant the All-Stars finished the tournament 3-0, while the other three teams - the Mile High Club, the <a href="http://www.texasrollergirls.org/teams-staff/texecutioners/">Texas Rollergirls Texecutioners</a> and the <a href="http://www.bayareaderbygirls.com/teams/golden-girls-all-stars">B.ay A.rea D.erby Girls Golden Girls</a> - finished with records of 1-2. Based on point differential, Denver finished second, Texas third and B.ay A.rea fourth.</p>
        <p>The All-Stars led 100-56 at the half, though the bout was not nearly as one-sided as the score might suggest. </p>

<p>Denver started the second half strong, chipping away at the lead until the score was 138-128 in favor of the All-Stars with 48 seconds left to play. Sami "Slamsonite" Lester took lead jammer for Denver in the final jam. The All-Stars' <a href="http://www.windycityrollers.com/members/yvette-yourmaker/">Yvette YourMaker</a> quickly went to the penalty box, giving Denver a power jam. </p>

<p>But the power jam didn't last long, as Lester soon went to the box, releasing Yvette YourMaker. The All-Stars managed to hold Lester to only four points after she was released from the penalty box, securing the win and the tournament title.</p>

<p>"It was fun to play - fun and nerve-wracking," All-Stars captain Bork Bork Bork said after the bout. "This was a big step forward for us as a team."</p>

<p>Though the All-Stars came out on top, Bork Bork Bork said the team could have done more to take advantage of the times when Denver's jammers were in the penalty box. </p>

<p>"Power jams, when giving to you, are a gift," she said.</p>

<p>Bork Bork Bork praised the All-Stars' efforts to stay out of the penalty box Saturday and said the score could have been different had Denver had fewer penalties or the All-Stars had more.</p>

<p>"Denver had a ton of penalties," she said. "Typically it's Windy (City Rollers) in that position. You never know. This game can change so quickly."</p>

<p>In other action Saturday, Texas beat Denver 227-189 to secure third place. The Rollers' c-team, the <a href="http://www.windycityrollers.com/travel-teams/third-coast/">Third Coast</a>, beat the St. Louis-based Arch Rival Roller Girls Fleur De Linquents 274-113.</p>

        <p><img alt="Sox_200.png" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Sox_200.png" width="200" height="200" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" />As has been pretty clear for the last month or so, the White Sox will be sellers at July's trade deadline. They also will presumably be sellers post-trade deadline as well, placing any unsold vets on waivers and trying to work deals that way as well. Simply put, the Sox tried to run back last year by making only small cosmetic moves this past offseason. It didn't work, and now it's time to rebuild. For real, this time.</p>

<p>Right now, the Sox have one of the worst farm systems in the game, second-to-last in Baseball America's <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/2013-organizational-talent-rankings-list/" target="_blank">organizational talent rankings</a> and third-to-last in Keith Law's <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8902178/st-louis-cardinals-lead-keith-law-ranking-all-30-farm-systems-mlb" target="_blank">farm system ranks</a> (Insider only link). The Sox only had three top-100 picks in last month's <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/draft/2013/story/_/id/9349522/every-draft-pick" target="_blank">entry draft</a>, including the 17th selection. </p>

<p>The club obviously needs to replenish their young talent. In a glass half-full kind of way, it's good that the Sox are 38-56, because then they can shut down this season and not worry about what could have been.</p>
        <p>General manager Rick Hahn got things started last week, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/22736732/red-sox-acquire-matt-thornton-from-white-sox-in-trade" target="_blank">trading </a>reliever Matt Thornton to Boston for minor league outfielder Brandon Jacobs. The Sox didn't land a top prospect, but in addition to shedding $2.75 million of Thornton's deal they got something moving forward. If Jacobs amounts to anything (either a Major League ballplayer or an asset for another trade), then great. If not, nothing big was lost.</p>

<p>Here's a look at who else should be looking for homes in new cities, with a bunch of unsubstantiated rumors and fake trades that won't happen mixed in. Apologies in advance for some ESPN Insider-only links (I reprinted or summarized what was important). </p>

<h3>ALEX RIOS</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Why he might be traded</strong>: Even though Rios only has one home run and a .244 batting average the last month, he's still a five-tool veteran player who could <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9475227/trade-market-outfielders-alex-rios-alfonso-soriano" target="_blank">help a contending team</a>. His contract isn't horrible either: the rest of this year and then next year at $13 million, with a team option for 2015 at $13.5 million (and a $1 million buyout). </p>

<p><strong>Total rumors</strong>: On this front, the Pirates are <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/22813757/pirates-are-looking-at-chisoxs-rios-and-might-like-ramirez-to" target="_blank">the leading team</a> to get Rios. Pittsburgh is 57-39 and shooting for their first postseason appearance since 1992, and they have both a <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/sort/OPS/order/true" target="_blank">mediocre offense</a> and a hole in right field. Despite the good fits, more rumors emerge, saying the trade <a href="https://twitter.com/DanHayesCSN/status/358408236845645825" target="_blank">won't happen</a>. Other teams interested in Rios include the <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4902077/trade-target-alex-rios" target="_blank">Rangers</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcafardo/status/358294117198991361" target="_blank">Red Sox</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Totally fake trade</strong>: From <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/the-gms-office/post?id=7103" target="_blank">ESPN's Jim Bowden</a>: "The Chicago White Sox trade Alex Rios and Alexei Ramirez to the Pittsburgh Pirates for outfielder Gregory Polanco, pitcher Nick Kingham and shortstop Jordy Mercer." That would be two top-10 prospects from the Pirates, <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/draft/ask-ba-updating-the-pirates-top-10/" target="_blank">according to Baseball America</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Likelihood he'll be dealt:</strong> Moderate to high. While Rios would be worth $19 million over the next one-and-a-half years if he performs like he did in 2012, he would be dead money if <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/07/rosenthal-on-rios-johnson-dbacks-reds.html" target="_blank">he has another 2011 season in him</a>. The Sox might have to throw in prospects or eat some money to get him dealt. Rios also has a no-trade clause and <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/07/alex-rios-no-trade-list.html" target="_blank">won't accept deals</a> to the Yankees, A's, D-Backs or Royals, narrowing his potential destinations. </p>

<h3>JAKE PEAVY</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Why he might get traded</strong>: Peavy is one of the best available arms on the market, and he's a tough guy who could start a big game. He could easily slide into a rotation and be the second or third starter.</p>

<p><strong>Total rumors</strong>: The <a href="https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/355630558019190785" target="_blank">Diamondbacks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/358609768002240512" target="_blank">Red Sox</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/358594297269993473" target="_blank">Rockies and Giants </a>are all interested. The <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/07/central-notes-phillips-reds-morneau-pirates.html" target="_blank">Blue Jays and Yankees </a>are kicking the tires. The Nationals <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/07/nats-notes.html" target="_blank">could be a fit</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Totally fake trade</strong>: From<a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9488075/cliff-lee-pirates-plus-other-national-league-trades-happen-mlb" target="_blank"> ESPN's Dan Szymborski</a>: "Nationals acquire Jake Peavy from the White Sox for pitcher Nate Karns, second baseman Tony Renda and outfielder Steven Souza." A couple <a href="http://baseballprospectnation.com/2013/03/11/2013-washington-nationals-top-15-prospects/" target="_blank">top Nationals prospects</a>, the Sox could stock up on multiple positions.</p>

<p><strong>Likelihood he'll be dealt</strong>: High. Peavy has been called <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/22829025/regardless-of-garza-a-returning-jake-peavy-may-be-the-market-star" target="_blank">the star of this year's trade deadline</a>, and his contract is viewed as favorable. He'll make about $7 million through the rest of this year and $14.5 million next year. Teams like that he won't just be a rental, that he can be a part of 2014's rotation, too. As we see year after year, contending teams can never trade for too many arms down the stretch. Injuries happen, ineffectiveness happens, tough pitching matchups emerge. You want a guy like Peavy starting for you if you need a big win. </p>

<h3>JESSE CRAIN </h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Why he might be traded</strong>: Despite an injury this month, Crain's value has never been higher. The reliever throws in the mid-90s and is having a career year, and the Sox will have little use for a set-up man for the rest of this season. Many good teams in both leagues have issues with their bullpens, and Crain is very getable. </p>

<p><strong>Total rumors</strong>: The <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/addison-reed/" target="_blank">Tigers</a>, <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/07/bowdens-latest-garza-rox-rios-morneau-perkins.html" target="_blank">Reds, Cardinals, Dodgers and Braves</a> are all monitoring Crain. The pitcher <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rockies/ci_23666903/jesse-crain-being-shopped-by-white-sox-could" target="_blank">nearly signed</a> with the Rockies in 2010 and thinks that it would be <a href="http://fullcount.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/2013/07/16/jesse-crain-thinks-red-sox-would-be-fun-to-play-for/" target="_blank">fun to play for the Red Sox</a>. Both those teams are interested in Crain, too.</p>

<p><strong>Totally fake trade</strong>: From <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9484831/chase-utley-plus-other-possible-al-trades-mlb" target="_blank">ESPN's Dave Cameron</a>: "White Sox trade reliever Jesse Crain to the Red Sox for shortstop Deven Marrero." Marrero would be a <a href="http://www.minorleagueball.com/2013/1/7/3848710/boston-red-sox-top-20-prospects-for-2013" target="_blank">better prospect</a> than newly-acquired Jacobs, but not an elite guy. </p>

<p><strong>Likelihood of a trade</strong>: Very high. Crain strained his right shoulder in June and has been <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/21418769-574/jesse-crains-return-trade-status-unclear.html" target="_blank">working his way back</a> since. But, the injury isn't considered significant, and even if Crain isn't moved by the deadline, it's almost a guarantee he'll be traded in August. </p>

<h3>ADAM DUNN</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Why he might be traded</strong>: Dunn has been good at the plate this summer. He had a .991 OPS in June and a .887 OPS this month, with 12 homers combined. He's walking more often and striking out a little less. A team that needs a lefty bat could do worse.</p>

<p><strong>Total rumors</strong>: <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/mlb/rumors/post?id=5546" target="_blank">Tampa Bay might be a good fit</a> for Dunn because the Rays need offense from their DH spots. </p>

<p><strong>Totally fake trade</strong>: From <a href="https://twitter.com/FacebookPirates/status/358743382236999681" target="_blank">some guy on Twitter</a>: Pirates trade Jose Tabata and Tony Sanchez for Adam Dunn. Call it in!!</p>

<p><strong>Likelihood of a trade</strong>: Low to moderate. Despite Dunn's <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/15964/red-hot-adam-dunn-enters-trade-picture" target="_blank">hot play</a>, Dunn is owed $15 million next year, which is a lot for a soon-to-be 34-year-old 1B/DH who only hits for power and might only get a .800 OPS. </p>

<h3>EVERYONE ELSE</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Why they might be traded</strong>: It all goes back to chance to improve the team for the future. The Sox have been described as "<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/22550045/chisox-are-open-for-business-all-but-sale-konerko-are-available" target="_blank">open for business</a>" and the Hahn said he's been getting <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/22497599/chisox-may-have-big-sale-rios-peavy-crain-beckham-etc-in-mix" target="_blank">a rush a phone calls about trades</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Total rumors</strong>: Alexei Ramirez <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/jon-heyman/22813757/pirates-are-looking-at-chisoxs-rios-and-might-like-ramirez-to" target="_blank">could be included</a> in a Rios trade to the Pirates. </p>

<p><strong>Totally fake trades</strong>: From <a href="https://twitter.com/akallday22/status/356809548826292224" target="_blank">another guy on Twitter</a>: Angels trade Mark Trumbo, C.J. Cron or Peter Borjous for Jose Quintana and Addison Reed. [Throws hands in air]. </p>

<p><strong>Likelihood of trades</strong>: Moderate. The Sox would want a decent haul for Addison Reed, Nate Jones, Dayan Viciedo and Gordon Beckham. Conversely, Matt Lindstrom and Alejandro De Aza could be gotten for a cheaper price. And if the Sox waive John Danks and some team actually claims him, Chicago would strongly consider letting him go for nothing in return (and save $42 million over the next three years). </p>

<h3>CHRIS SALE</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Why he might be traded</strong>: He's an ace, one of the best pitchers in the league, and he's only 24 and under team control through 2019. </p>

<p><strong>Total rumors</strong>: Sale isn't going anywhere. He's <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/06/27/heyman-all-but-konerko-sale-available-from-white-sox/" target="_blank">untouchable</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Totally fake trades</strong>: From <a href="https://twitter.com/dagooooo/status/358100770006106113" target="_blank">yet another guy on Twitter</a>, corroborated by an <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4902142/trade-target-chris-sale" target="_blank">ESPN Dallas writer</a>: White Sox trade Sale to Rangers for Jurickson Profar and Mike Olt. Good luck with that. </p>

<p><strong>Likelihood of a trade</strong>: Very low. Hawk Harrelson has said that <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/16105/trade-sale-hawk-says-no-untouchables" target="_blank">no one should be considered untouchable</a>, and he's right. The Sox think that way, too. It just means they won't be shopping Sale around, and it will really take <em>a lot</em> to get them to part with Sale. They have a phenomenally talented young lefty locked up through the rest of the decade. Sure, there are dumb teams in the league that could very well make the Sox reconsider their "untouchable" stance, but that is highly unlikely. But not impossible.</p>

<p>The All-Stars, <a href="http://wftda.com/rankings">ranked 10th in the world (as of June 30) by the Women's Flat Track Derby Association</a>, beat the 4th-ranked Bay Area Derby Girls Golden Girls 237-174 and 6th-ranked Texas Rollergirls Texecutioners 155-152. All that stands between the All-Stars and the trophy are the 2nd-ranked (again, as of June 30) Denver Roller Dolls Mile High Club.</p>
        <p>In other tournament action, Denver beat Bay Area 181-137 and in Saturday's undercard bout, the Rollers' b-team, <a href="http://www.windycityrollers.com/travel-teams/second-wind/">the Second Wind</a>, lost to the Ontario, Canada-based Tri-City Thunder 220-170. </p>

<p>All-Star Janicide Joplin said after the team's win over Texas that while they played well, they still have things to work on, specifically keeping the pack speed down.</p>

<p>"The slower the pack is, the more times the jammer can get through," she said. "We are working on keeping it slow."</p>

<p>She added that the All-Stars also need to do more to make sure their jammers stay out of the penalty box and that if they had done that, the score might not have been so close.</p>

<p>"The power jams can get ugly," she said.</p>

<p>Nadie Kean, who skates for the Texecutioners as Smarty Pants, praised the All-Stars' blockers.</p>

<p>"They're very, very powerful women that are hard to get around," Kean said. </p>

<p>Like Janicide Joplin, she also believes her team needs to keep their jammers on the track.</p>

<p>"We had a lot of jammer trips to the (penalty) box," Kean said. "It's hard to score points."</p>

<p>The tournament continues at noon today.</p>

That was 25 days ago. Since then, the team has whisked the Cup all over town, Bolland was shipped to Toronto, the NHL draft happened, with Stan Bowman wheeling and dealing the afternoon away, and free agency kicking in.</p>

<p>And now, just earlier today, the Blackhawks officially posted its <a href="http://blackhawks.nhl.com/club/schedule.htm">2013-14 schedule</a>, with the first preseason game on Tuesday, September 17, against the Red Wings at the United Center.</p>
        <p>Save your pennies for the season opener at home on Tuesday, October 1, which will include a certain banner-raising ceremony with the Capitals in town. Other notable dates include:</p>

<p>-Saturday, October 19: Maple Leafs at Blackhawks -- Dave Bolland returns as a Maple Leaf.</p>

<p>-This year's "Circus Trip" has the Hawks away from Tuesday, November 19, until Saturday, November 30.</p>

<p>-The Hawks and Red Wings only play twice in the regular season from here on out, with the Red Wings heading over to the Eastern Conference. The first game is in Detroit and will be televised on NBC SportsNet on Wednesday, January 22. The return game at the UC will be on Sunday, March 16.</p>

<p>-The Hawks and Bruins also play two games, with the first being in Chicago on Sunday, January 19, and the other in Beantown on Thursday, March 27.</p>

<p>One item to note for this year's NHL schedule, much like in 2010, is the Winter Olympics will play a factor. The NHL announced today that players in the NHL will be able participate in the Games in Sochi. This means a total of five games for the Blackhawks in the month of February, at least for those not representing their respective country.</p>

<p>The preliminary hockey round in the Olympics is scheduled to begin Wednesday, February 12, with the Gold Medal game on Sunday, February 23. The teams competing include:</p>

<p><strong>GROUP A</strong><br />
Russia<br />
Slovenia<br />
Slovakia<br />
United States</p>

<p><strong>GROUP B</strong><br />
Austria<br />
Canada<br />
Finland<br />
Norway</p>

<p><strong>GROUP C</strong><br />
Czech Republic<br />
Latvia<br />
Switzerland<br />
Sweden</p>

<p>If these Games are anything like those from 2010, hockey fans from all over the world will be in for a treat. Meanwhile, general managers and owners everywhere will watch on the edge of their collective seats, holding their breath so as no one will turn an ankle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this city is still in a daze from the thrill ride the Blackhawks gave everyone some 25 days ago. We can plan ahead for it all to start again a mere 60 days from now...and counting.</p>

Also taking part in the tournament are the <a href="http://www.texasrollergirls.org/teams-staff/texecutioners/">Texas Rollergirls Texecutioners</a>, currently ranked 6th, and the 4th-ranked <a href="http://www.bayareaderbygirls.com/teams/golden-girls-all-stars">Bay Area Derby Girls Golden Girls</a>. </p>
        <p>Amy Hanson, also known as F.N. Fed and who skates for the Manic Attackers (one of WCR's home teams), helped plan the tournament and said it started two years ago by the Bay Area Derby Girls, along with Windy City and the Texas Rollergirls. The first year, the tournament was held in California and it was held in Texas under a different name last year, she said.</p>

<p>Hanson said that while Texas used a different name when they hosted last year, the committee that planned this year's event wanted to change it back.</p>

<p>"We're trying to bring it back to the name Golden Bowl," she said. </p>

<p>In addition to the tournament bouts, WCR's other travel teams - the <a href="http://www.windycityrollers.com/travel-teams/second-wind/">Second Wind</a> and <a href="http://www.windycityrollers.com/travel-teams/third-coast/">Third Coast</a> - will also play this weekend in between tournament bouts. The Second Wind faces off against Ontario's Tri-City Thunder tomorrow afternoon, while the Third Coast takes on the <a href="http://www.archrivalrollergirls.com/teams-staff/fdl/">Fleur-De-Linquents</a>, the c-team of the St. Louis-based Arch Rival Roller Girls.</p>

<p>This year's tournament will feature one thing that has not been seen in years past - a traveling trophy awarded to the winner. </p>

<p>"The trophy itself will be a golden bowl," Hanson said. <br />

<p>It's a paradox, but it's true. Allen was one of the most controversial players in MLB during the 1960s and 70s, always in the headlines in the sports sections for the wrong reasons. Now? Allen hasn't gotten the recognition he has deserved as one of the best hitters in the game, someone who was an all-around force on the baseball field.</p>

<p>Allen, who spent his best years with the Phillies and White Sox, finished his career with 351 home runs, and a slash line of .292/.378/.534. That's a .912 career OPS, the 55th best of all-time (and better than Mike Schmidt and Willie Stargell). He won the 1972 AL MVP award, carrying a Sox team filled with nobodies to 87 wins and a second-place finish. Yet Allen isn't in the hall of fame and is hardly remembered, save for <a href="http://dickallenhof.blogspot.com/">baseball diehards</a>.</p>

<p>Dick Allen shares his story in the 1989 book, <em>Crash: The Life and Times of Dick Allen</em>, by Allen and writer Tim Whitaker. The book is a good one, and for the most part, Allen's life story comes straight from the horse's mouth.</p>
        <p>The book mixes up styles, changing the writing format chapter by chapter. Some chapters are told in Allen's first-person voice, like his story on his years in Philadelphia in the 1960s. Others are in the form of an interview between Whitaker and Allen, who is referred to as "The Ballplayer" throughout the book. The best chapters, though, are short quick-hit stories told in the third-person, where Allen recalls moments from his playing days. </p>

<p>Allen tells stories about doodling in the dirt, and writing messages to fans, teammates and even umpires while manning first base. In the minors and chasing a batting crown with another player, Allen tried to sabotage his rival by out-drinking him at a bar, only to have it backfire. There are stories on Allen's friend Alex Johnson calling everyone he talked with a rude insult (a compound word, with the second part being "head"). Stories on Allen challenging Greg Luzinski to an old-timers home run derby and Allen challenging a group of men to a doo-wop singing competition in a Philadelphia bar.</p>

<p>We also get glowing quotes from people who knew the ballplayer. Chuck Tanner, the Sox manager in 1972, stands out in particular. He said that Allen carried the team that year, and that Allen had the best year of any White Sox player ever. "In my mind," Tanner said, "Allen was the greatest White Sox player to ever wear the uniform." </p>

<p>Yet Allen had his problems. Through the first-person style, Allen reveals that he drank before, and even during, games. He loathed sportswriters, and when he didn't feel like talking with them he would gladly blow them off (leading to negative publicity). He feuded with managers who didn't treat him the way he wanted. He had no qualms about leaving his team for extended periods if he was hurt or if he didn't like his situation.</p>

<p>This goes back to the beauty of this book. Whitaker never writes anything bad about Allen - in the epilogue, the author actually says he loves Allen and considers him a friend - but he lets the ballplayer do the talking, and the reader to make his or her own inferences. Baseball was very conservative in the 1960s, and there was no way a free-spirited black ballplayer would ever get a fair shake in the league. But then again, Allen never viewed his actions from anyone else's perspective, either. </p>

<p>The book is only 189 pages, and it is a very quick read - I finished it in two days in three sittings. It's also a lighter read than I thought, more fun than it is dramatic. The <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/search/details/cn/932216">Chicago Public Library</a> has it, as does <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crash-Life-Times-Dick-Allen/dp/0899196578/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1374184606&sr=8-1&keywords=crash+life+and+times+of+dick+allen">Amazon </a> and <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&tn=crash+the+life+and+times+of+dick+allen">Abe Books</a>. </p>

<p>Whether Allen was treated unfairly in baseball or Allen brought his troubles on himself, there was one overriding theme in the book that is an undisputed fact: Allen liked to be left alone. He did what was best for him and didn't like management dictating what he should do. He coped with life and baseball difficulties by taking long solo car rides, and he achieved the most peace when he was by himself with his horses.</p>

<p>The most poignant quote in the book comes from one of Allen's cousins, who says that Allen was always someone who preferred to be alone, even as a child. "If Dickie could have played his major league career in empty ballparks - no fans, no media - he would have hit eight hundred, nine hundred home runs. He would have made people forget about Hank Aaron."</p>

<p>Instead, we've forgotten about Dick Allen.</p>

        <p>As a father of three children under the age of 13, I am hyper-sensitive to the issue of child bicycle safety.  It wasn't too long ago that I taught them each how to ride a bike.  </p>

<p><strong>How do we teach our children to ride a bicycle? Do we teach bicycle safety?</strong></p>

<p>Here was my process: 1. Removed training wheels from bike; 2. Put child on bike and said, "I'm going to hold onto you, jog down the block for a bit and then let go"; 3. Started jogging along with them until they seemed steady; 4. Let go of bike; 5. Watched helplessly as they lost control and fell; 6. Helped them up; 7. Watched them get mad at me and run inside house to pout for a bit; 8. Repeated steps 3 and 4.</p>
        <p><strong>UPDATE: Seeking information on a child that was backed over while on his bicycle at Lincoln and Paulina. More information available <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1iktss/hit_and_run_yesterday_on_lincoln_and_paulina/">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are we doing everything we can to protect our kids?</strong><br />
<img alt="child-bicycle-accident.png" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/child-bicycle-accident.png" width="275" height="183" class="right" />Eventually, after some bumps and scrapes, they were officially capable of riding a bicycle on their own.  After taking some photos, hiding a tear and feeling super proud, I realized that my most important job was just beginning -- educating them regarding bicycle safety.   </p>

<p>Now you know how I taught my kids how to ride a bike.  It's how my dad taught me to ride a bike and probably how his dad taught him.  Heck, with a few slight variances, it's probably how all of us learned how to ride a bike.  After that day in our lives, we don't learn too much more about bike safety.  Usually, when we're learning how to ride a bike, we're too young to read the "Rules of the Road."  There are generally no bike safety courses in the grammar schools.  Aside from an occasional pointer here and there like, "wear a helmet," for most of us, our bicycle safety training is complete soon after we learn how to ride, though it should be just beginning.  </p>

<p><strong>Children are more likely to be in an accident in the summer</strong></p>

<p>In Chicago, summertime means more kids riding their bikes leading to the inevitable spike in bike accidents.  The summer weather summons children with their bikes to neighborhood sidewalks and streets for some care-free fun in the sun.  Unfortunately, every year, thousands of kids are seriously injured or killed because a driver backing up from a driveway or a parking spot didn't see them.  These incidents are called "backovers" and happen whether a child is on a bike or not.  According to <a href="http://www.kidsandcars.org">kidsandcars.org</a>, at least 50 children are backed over by vehicles every week.  Most are treated in hospital emergency rooms but some die.  </p>

<p><strong>Shouldn't our vehicles be safer?</strong></p>

Government is here.  Well...maybe not?  The 2008 Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act required a rear visibility rule to be set by Feb. 28, 2011. However, the 2011 deadline has been repeatedly delayed.  Last month, for the fourth time, the Department of Transportation disobeyed a Congressional order to set a rule to improve rear visibility so drivers can see small children immediately behind their vehicles.  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood informed Congress that more research is needed.  You may translate this to mean "more research is needed."  I translate it to mean the auto industry lobbyists are doing their job since requiring cameras will be costly and may mean fewer car sales. </p>

<p>Regardless of my interpretation of "more research," the new deadline is now January 2015 for the regulations.  This is quite disturbing in light of the fact that the NHTSA estimates that, on average, 292 fatalities and 18,000 injuries occur each year as a result of backovers.  In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed mandating rear-view cameras for all new vehicles, phased in through 2014.  Well we know now that that's not going to happen.<br />
 <br />
It's sad that we have the technology to prevent many child tragedies but no requirements that said technology be used -- funny how it seems that we all have video cameras on our cell phones, but not on the backs of our cars.  Until our government catches up, education and awareness regarding back-overs become especially important to children and adults alike.  Even when our government catches up with technology and all new vehicles have backup cameras (I do think that will happen someday), education and awareness will remain critical given the vast amount of older model vehicles that do not have this technology.</p>

<p><strong>What can you do to protect children and yourself from a back-over accident?</strong></p>

<p>As adults, we must not be satisfied with that proud moment when our children learn how to ride a bike for the first time.  We must teach them of the dangers associated with riding a bicycle including things such as back-overs.  Like bathing, educating your children does not last.  Therefore, we must educate our children continuously about bike safety.  Of course in order to do so, we must educate ourselves regarding bike safety and how to prevent <a href="http://www.willenslaw.com/will-bicyclists-death-force-idot-to-act/">bicycle accidents</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to educating children about bike safety, I urge you, whether you have a rear-view camera on your vehicle or not, to take this simple precaution when getting in your vehicle in driveways and parking lots as 10 seconds could save a life: Walk all the way around your parked vehicle to check for children before getting in.  In addition to looking directly around your vehicle, look down the block for kids playing on foot or riding their bicycles.  Be aware of your surroundings before starting your engine.  This five to ten-second walk around your vehicle just might prevent a tragedy.  </p>

The game is not just an entertaining exhibition for spectators and a reward for talented players, it also serves as a snapshot of a moment in time; all the best players gathered for one game, a marker of what happened and who mattered in a current year. Some might say otherwise, but All-Star games, particularly Major League Baseball's, are still a big deal.</p>

<p>In that context, it's crazy that the game had to be invented, and that it was a radical idea. It wasn't created by the commissioner or an owner or even a player. No, it was a concept thought up by a sportswriter. In 1933, Arch Ward, the sports editor at the Chicago Tribune, organized a one-game exhibition between the best players in the National and American Leagues at Comiskey Park. </p>
        <p>On July 6, the AL bested the NL 4-2 in front of 49,200 fans. The game featured not only some of the best players of that year, but some of the best players of all time. Lou Gehrig, Charlie Gehringer, Lefty Gomez and Babe Ruth all started, and Ruth even smacked a home run. Bill Dickey, Jimmie Foxx, Pie Traynor and Paul Waner came off the bench. Chicago was also represented, as the city claimed five All-Stars between the Cubs and Sox, including Gabby Hartnett and Al Simmons.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://chicagohistory.org/planavisit/exhibitions/unexpected-chicago">Chicago History Museum</a> has the ball that started it all. The baseball, the first pitch of the game by Gomez, was signed by Ruth and several other 1933 All-Stars, and is part of the Unexpected Chicago exhibition. The ball will be on display for the rest of July and through August. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.chicagohistory.org/">Museum </a>has many other exhibitions as well, from an installation on Abraham Lincoln to an Ebony Magazine fashion fair. The Chicago History Museum is at 1601 N. Clark St. in Chicago, and ticket prices are $14 for adults, $12 for seniors and students from 13-22, and free for kids under 12. <br />

        <p><img alt="Boxing_Ring.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Boxing_Ring.jpg" width="278" height="222" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /> Former <a href="http://www.chicagogoldengloves.com/">Chicago Golden Gloves</a> heavyweight champ Thomas Hayes looks on while a group from the Chicago Park District constructs an outdoor boxing ring smack dab in front of the Picasso in Daley Plaza. Sweat drips down his face as the morning sun beats down heavily on his brow while directing traffic and unpacking boxes.</p>

<p>"K.O. Time," as Hayes has been known inside and out of the squared circle, hung up his gloves a few years ago after sweating and beating brows for almost nine. His fighting résumé has him well-traveled along the West Coast and throughout the Midwest, including a WBC Continental Americas Heavyweight shot against Chris Arreola, his second and final loss in <a href="http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=145378&cat=boxer">29 fights</a>, all while training under Kevin Rooney.</p>

<p>But before Hayes walked down aisles in arenas, he walked his way to high school at Leo on the south side. One of those trips to school resulted in a gunshot wound from a .22 caliber, which would change the course of his life forever.</p>
        <p>Hayes healed, played football for Leo, and began to box for both the high school and the Chicago Park District system. He learned the hard way how to get back up and shake hands with his enemy with hard work, dedication and will to overcome the pain and fear of having been shot. It's what pushed Hayes to winning the Chicago Golden Gloves heavyweight title at the tender age of 20.</p>

<p>Now years later, Hayes is giving back, donating his time and effort in training kids to box through the Chicago Park District. He's only been involved the past eight months, but his time and effort are already paying dividends.</p>

<p>"The discipline I learned through this program is what I want to pass along to these kids," Hayes said, with gleam in his eye. "I came up through the same system when I was 18, 19 years old."</p>

Passersby in suits and other business attire walked by the downtown ring during their power lunch, stopped, took out their ear buds and looked on with a smile, some even motioning with body language from power shots, as controlled fury from persistent training was on display.</p>

<p>Boys and girls from the north, south and west sides are joining these boxing programs, from Brooks Park on North Harlem to Ogden Park on South Racine. Each of the <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/facilities/boxing-gyms/">20 locations</a> offer free seminars, which includes practicing technique from experienced instructors.</p>

<p>"There's been a big push recently for boxing at our parks locations," said Tim O'Connell, assistant director of recreation through the Park District. "You get to see the discipline of young men and women inside the ring. Offering more training for our staff has helped the program grow."</p>

<p>In fact, each instructor at all locations is licensed by the U.S. Amateur Boxing Federation with group and individual coaching for those interested. The ever expanding program also includes a local and citywide tournament with top-notch boxing equipment for use, including gloves and head gear.

After exiting the ring and hugging their respective parents, a high-five and hug came to Hayes.</p>

<p>The reward of a win was on the mind of each youth at this event, as the steady crowd of between 100-200 looked on as the outdoor heat increased. Never once were any haymakers or out-of-control punches thrown in order to score a victory through nerves. These kids kept their cool and displayed the discipline Hayes and company preach at each seminar.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted to box," said 17-year-old Ivan Rios before his match. "My sister mentioned I should look into the program a few years ago. I went to an event and loved it."</p>

<p>Rios, whose favorite boxer is Juan Manuel Márquez, already has molded into a promising young fighter with quick footwork and even quicker hands. His two years in the program have proven their worth.</p>

<p>Whether these youngsters got into the ring to escape something personal by finding an out, or are looking to get into better shape by dropping the gaming console, is unclear. What is certain is that Hayes, O'Connell and the rest of the Park District's efforts in teaching the sweet science that is boxing, has found a way into the hearts of hundreds of kids across the city from those who are paying it forward.</p>

<p>Even if the current crop of young pugilists doesn't make it as far as Hayes did in the ring, the only thing that would matter is if they go as far as his efforts outside of it. Then, boxing, and the future of the youth in this city, will be even brighter by way of knocking out fear and shaking hands at the end.</p>
