<p>Dear friends and supporters of <a href="http://www.bebor.org/">Bebor Model Nursery and Primary School</a>,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m not on Twitter and I won&#8217;t be able to keep this to 140 characters but I did want to give you all a succinct and focused look at one aspect of the work we do with the schools in Nigeria to put into context the funding we just sent them last week and also some of the challenges we face.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bane-Buildings.jpg" rel="lightbox[6068]" title="A Tale of Two Roofs"><img class="wp-image-6071 alignright" style="margin: 5px;" alt="Bane Buildings" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bane-Buildings.jpg" width="358" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>This is a tale of two roofs, one at the newest school we are helping in Bori and one at the first school we started helping in Bodo. Let me start with the good news from Bori. This first photo is almost exactly a year ago from my last trip to Nigeria. It shows where the school in Bori was before we started helping them—the shells of 2 classroom buildings largely built up to roof level. The second photo shows what the buildings look like now after the funding we sent them last year. Both because they funded the initial work on the buildings with local resources and because we are largely, though not entirely, out of the building construction aspect of this project, were able to go straight to a more expensive rustproof aluminum roof that will never need replacing. The funds we sent constructed the porticoes outside each building and finished roofing the largest building and started roofing the smaller building. Because of other work going on at the church where they were previously meeting, they moved all the kids into the first building even though it still needs additional work like plastering the walls and putting in window and door frames. We just sent additional funds last week to finish roofing the second building.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bodo-assembly-hall-building-with-damaged-roof.jpg" rel="lightbox[6068]" title="A Tale of Two Roofs"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6072" style="border: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Bodo assembly hall building with damaged roof" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bodo-assembly-hall-building-with-damaged-roof.jpg" width="352" height="227" /></a></p>
<p>The third photo shows the bad news from Bodo. As many of you already know, with the exception of one building in Bane where Timmy Global Health helped pay for the extra cost of a rustproof roof, our other four classroom buildings (three in Bodo and one in Bane) all initially had regular zinc roofs put on them. This was largely because we simply didn&#8217;t have the funds on hand to do rustproof roofs given all the other things we were committing resources to like constructing the buildings themselves. We knew that we would eventually have to re-roof all of these buildings and, again, as many of you know, started working on this a few years ago.</p>
<p>Working on the oldest buildings first, we successfully installed rust-proof roofs on two of the classroom buildings in Bodo and the other classroom building in Bane. We knew that we needed to get to the final classroom building in Bodo but a tropical storm beat us to it and damaged the old and partially rusted roof badly as the third photo shows. Our work can get delayed for any number of reasons—we don&#8217;t have enough funds on hand; it takes awhile to reach agreement with the school directors on what we are going to do next; it sometimes takes them awhile to utilize our funds; and it sometimes takes them even longer to send documentation and photos showing that our funds were used wisely and in accordance with our agreed aims. In this case, severe weather overtook the relatively slow pace of our progress and damaged significant parts of the roof on the only classroom building in Bodo without a rustproof roof. The good news is that they have a temporary tarp up now that has enabled them to continue using the building. The even better news is that we just sent the funds last week to re-roof this building with a rustproof roof. Before the summer is out we should have all seven of our classroom buildings (3 in Bodo, 2 in Bane, 2 in Bori) finished with rustproof roofs that will never need replacing! With luck, you&#8217;ll never have to see photos like this one again.</p>
<p>Thanks as always for your past, present and hopefully continued support of our humble work in the Niger Delta.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Some-of-the-Timmy-Team.jpg" rel="lightbox[6036]" title="Pharmacy with Timmy: Getting Back to Basics  "><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6041" alt="Some of the Timmy Team" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Some-of-the-Timmy-Team.jpg" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traveling to <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/monte-cristi-dominican-republic/">Monte Cristi</a> with the Washington University/University of Minnesota team was my second trip with Timmy Global Health. When people see pictures and hear stories of the trips, I usually get raised eyebrows in response. They question why I’d be willing to bathe in DEET, be covered in sweat/dirt/grime, speak in a different language, and maybe—if we’re lucky—get a lukewarm shower at night. And all during a week I took off as “vacation”.</p>
<p>But to me, this is vacation. It’s a change of scenery and thinking. To be successful on these trips, in addition to knowing your vocation, you have to be flexible, creative and a team player. And since like attracts like, the other volunteers are of a similar mindset.</p>
<p>To me, this is fun.</p>
<p>And I get to help people.</p>
<p>And I get to travel to remote corners of the world that my husband would never dream of following me to.</p>
<p>There was a recent letter in the New York Times from a physician describing the feeling of being overwhelmed. He describes feeling pressured to keep up with the latest information, newest guidelines, different dosage forms, emerging side effects, and Dr. Oz&#8217;s ludicrous recommendations&#8230;</p>
<p>My experience in <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/monte-cristi-dominican-republic/">Monte Cristi </a>was the exact opposite. It was back to basics in an obvious way. We had <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2013/06/24/timmycare-2-0-the-war-on-paper-continues/">TimmyCare,</a> but that wasn’t close to the computers we’re accustomed to in the state. My hospital in Boston received several “Leader in Technology and Wireless” awards…so <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/monte-cristi-dominican-republic/">Monte Cristi </a>was a slight adjustment. We had no laboratory tests to review. No cultures to interpret. No diagnostic tests to aid our suspicions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Our-Pharmacy-in-the-DR.jpg" rel="lightbox[6036]" title="Pharmacy with Timmy: Getting Back to Basics  "><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6040" alt="Our Pharmacy in the DR" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Our-Pharmacy-in-the-DR.jpg" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>However—what we did have—was a room full of experienced clinicians from many aspects of medicine. The pharmacy only had two references that we allotted precious cargo space to: LexiComp&#8217;s Drug Information Handbook (aka the Bible) and a Spanish-English medical dictionary. (Coincidentally, &#8220;diabetes&#8221; is still &#8220;diabetes&#8221; in Spanish). My pharmacy colleagues relied on our training and experiences and turned to each other for support and reassurance. A good portion of our care was treating infectious diseases, music to my ears, but maybe not so for the pediatric ophthalmologist, cardiologist, or OB/GYN (who were some of our fantastic providers). Since the pharmacy was often in the same room, providers stopped by to ask questions, to double-check doses, or get our opinion. Likewise, when we had prescription issues, we simply walked over and had a conversation. Also, we only had ~45 medications we could dispense.</p>
<p>Some particularly memorable interactions include:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-Manually checking for drug interactions (via reference books and good old medicinal chemistry).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-Panicking from the inability to &#8220;Google&#8221; ingredients for an obscure foreign anti-hypertensive (Fine. We cheated and had a <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2013/06/24/timmycare-2-0-the-war-on-paper-continues/">TimmyCare</a> guy use his global cellphone to look it up. For the record, we’d never seen 1 pill containing these 3 meds!)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-Consulting on a toddler for a skin infection. (Back home, we would treat topically. In <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/monte-cristi-dominican-republic/">Monte Cristi</a>, we only had tablets. In adult strengths).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-Developing such a good relationship with the providers, that by end of day one, several were writing “dosing per pharmacy.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-Playing the game of “Back home, I use ____, what can you give me here?”</p>
<p>Serving in <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/monte-cristi-dominican-republic/">Monte Cristi</a> was a reminder of why I went into pharmacy. It removed all the distractions from home. On the trip, we were required to think critically and creatively, and focus on the patient in front of us. And, to top it all off, we had to do it all in Spanish (or Creole)! I will forever be in debt to our very capable Peace Corps Volunteers for translating.</p>
<p>And as counterintuitive as it sounds, there’s a freedom with a limited formulary.</p>
<p>And not having to deal with insurance was AMAZING.</p>
<p>And speaking of creative &#8230; When was the last time you saw a pharmacy operating out of a Magic School Bus? I think we made Ms. Frizzle proud!</p>

<p>Public health and education projects have become a growing focus for Timmy as we seek out new ways to enhance and expand our programming. Sometimes even the simplest instructions on hygiene and personal care can have a huge impact on people that have little to no access to outside healthcare services. Learning how to properly wash your hands with soap, for instance, is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent disease.</p>
<p>In May, students and volunteers from the University of Colorado medical team joined Timmy&#8217;s staff in an exciting hand-washing campaign in one of our adopted communities near Quito, Ecuador. With the support of Unilever—which donated 1,000 mini-Rexona soaps and 50 educational posters for classrooms and bathrooms in the community—the team helped to lead hand-washing demonstrations that showed local children the importance of clean hands and the promise of healthy futures.</p>
<p>Below is a photo essay of the day&#8217;s activities. This event was just a small part of a much larger campaign—<a href="http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/healthandhygiene/handwashing/globalhandwashingday/">Global Handwashing Day</a>—an ongoing advocacy project that Unilever launched in 2008. Leaders from government, nonprofit, and public organizations in more than 45 countries took part in the most recent campaign in 2012, and Timmy is looking forward to continuing our clean hands movement when the celebration rolls around again on October 15th, 2013!</p>

<p>For those who have read <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2013/04/22/introducing-timmycare-an-electronic-medical-records-system-part-i/">Part 1</a>, you’ll remember the post ended with a cliffhanger—TimmyCare had declared open war on Paper and was gaining ground, but the victory seemed small and Paper barely noticed. To win would require legitimate approval from Timmy’s medical volunteers—many of whom were less that secretive about their limited enthusiasm for this non-paper solution. Ironically, many of their complaints stemmed from the look and feel of TimmyCare, which had been based on the original (and vile) paper forms. (Did you know that “evil” and “vile” are anagrams? So are “paper” and “destroyer of rainforests”…)</p>
<p><strong><em>The Paper Clinic</em></strong></p>
<p>To appease the medical volunteers, I set out to discover why our foe, Paper, set such a high standard for maintaining patient records. Here are a few points that I uncovered about Paper:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. It’s cheap (once you ignore the whole destroying-the-earth fact)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. It’s lightweight, easily transported, and easy to replace</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. It’s highly available</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. People are used to paper—they don’t have to be taught how to use it. Therefore, seeing more patients is as simple as handing out more paper to another doctor.</p>
<p>Each of these factors was contributing to a high barrier of entry for TimmyCare v1—which wasn’t cheap, lightweight, easily available, or easy to use. But one of TimmyCare v1’s most limiting qualities was its lack of access to historic patient data (anything previously written down on paper). Prior to any introduction of TimmyCare, Timmy’s staff and volunteers would haul all of the paper records to each site to ensure that when a patient was seen in one of Timmy’s clinics, the doctor had access to all of their previous histories (a tantamount point for quality of care.) TimmyCare v1 couldn’t provide this—it lacked access to the original paper data and provided no way to view past information. This simply wouldn’t fly with the doctors (and rightfully so).</p>
<p><strong><em>Speaking of Doctors</em></strong></p>
<p>Doctors are a great bunch—they save lives, they volunteer to come on medical trips, they like peanut butter, and so on. But a majority of doctors write like they’re being electrocuted while holding a pen between the 3rd and 4th digits of their non-dominant foot. And despite their limited penmanship skills, they seem to enjoy writing (on paper). This poses a 3-fold problem when using paper records in Timmy’s clinics:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. During clinic, non-medical professionals struggle to read the doctors’ scribbled patient notes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Post clinic, when trying to gather metrics, the reader has difficulty differentiating numbers from full out paragraphs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Most doctors will fight to the near death to keep using their precious paper. This poses quite a titanic trial because they are capable of saving themselves!</p>
<p>To make headway in convincing them that TimmyCare would be an improved alternative to Paper, I realized that we would need to 1) Surface the previous paper histories in a user friendly fashion and 2) Ensure that the entering and viewing of data wouldn’t slow them down. It’s true that with TimmyCare, Timmy’s clinic run faster. However, the doctors—on average are slower—which clearly doesn’t scale. Enter TimmyCare v2, to a Daft Punk set: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger (on repeat).</p>
<p><strong><em>Version 2.0</em></strong></p>
<p>As <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2013/04/22/introducing-timmycare-an-electronic-medical-records-system-part-i/">Part 1 of this blog post</a> described, version 1.0 was simply a digitization of the paper forms used in clinic. It was about as user friendly as Ikea’s furniture assembly instructions. It came with a steep learning curve, and did little else beyond disparaging users with red text when some arcane error occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Version 2.0 was slated to offer far more information on the screen in a non-intrusive way. Doctors would be able to view summarized information from previous visits on the same screen, offer alerts for medical allergies, and present important information like pregnancies and chronic conditions in an obvious manner. Additionally, TimmyCare v2 aimed to offer more than just the same information as the paper versions of the histories—it would make data entry efficient, more aligned with the approach doctors normally take, and flexible enough to allow them to enter data as they pleased. And, unlike the rather strict v1, v2 came equipped with snazzy animations and nifty features that (boring, old) v1 lacked. You can see a few of these updates in the hypothetical patient preview below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5941" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; cursor: default; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-width: 0px;" alt="ScreenShot1_History" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ScreenShot1_History.jpg" width="638" height="253" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5942" alt="ScreenShot2_Diagnoses" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ScreenShot2_Diagnoses.jpg" width="641" height="136" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognized that the new version required some extensive changes to the underlying software to ensure it remained efficient—many of which were untested. Nevertheless, TimmyCare v2 made its first appearance during the <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2013/05/28/1st-public-health-trip-health-promoter-trainings/">Cincinnati Med School Public Health Trip in April.</a> It entered confidently and seemed to work well, until it faced some heavy load… The new version began crashing on certain machines, it was losing data on certain records, it was rendering incorrectly on others, and most importantly was annoying the doctors.</p>
<p>Two things you should not do (in software development):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Deploy untested code</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Fix that code with more untested code on the spot</p>
<p>The 1st rule was broken due to time constraints and under-consumption of caffeine. The 2nd, however, was unforgivable. Fixing one thing while breaking another does not keep you on even ground.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nail in the Coffin</em></strong></p>
<p>Eventually v2 stabilized. Doctors were seeing the value—they were finding it intuitive, useful, even co-operative. They were writing vitals, notes, assessment plans, some Haikus. But the celebration was short-lived when we discovered another unsightly flaw related to gathering data for pediatric care. In order to diagnose proper physical development in children, we needed growth charts—and they were only on&#8230;Paper! So, Paper struck again, and this one was deep.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Muz-using-TimmyCare.jpg" rel="lightbox[5931]" title="TimmyCare 2.0: The War on Paper Continues"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5939" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Muz using TimmyCare" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Muz-using-TimmyCare.jpg" width="560" height="373" /></a>That following night, while the rest of the world slept, and more rainforests fell, diligently, TimmyCare v2 plodded along. On the dawn of the last brigade night, it delivered. Growth charts? No, dear readers, not growth charts. It delivered the ability to plot any vital or lab result for a patient. Doctors could see summaries of vitals in a single click. And that finally tipped the scales in our favor!</p>
<p>You see, Paper got complacent. It reigned supreme for thousands of years, forging alliances with graphite and ink, smugly dominating the world. Though the new development to TimmyCare v2 was no surprise attack, Paper still didn’t see it coming.</p>
<p><strong><em>vNext</em></strong></p>
<p>The next stage, naturally, is world domination—over Paper at least. TimmyCare is slated to run trials in Timmy’s other clinic sites (most recently we expanded the EMR to <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/monte-cristi-dominican-republic/">Timmy’s clinics in the DR</a>) to see if it can increase clinic efficiency and quality. However, there is much more to this project than saving rainforests, and charting patient vitals. That riveting discussion, however, is left for Part 3—so stay tuned!</p>

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Meaghan-with-a-youn-patient.jpg" rel="lightbox[5862]" title="My Long-term Volunteer Experience in the D.R."><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5869" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Meaghan with a young patient" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Meaghan-with-a-youn-patient-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a>Two words vital to the Dominican society were shared with me early on in my trip: <em>compartir</em> (to share) and <em>confianza</em> (confidence in a relationship). Although I had been learning Spanish since I was in secondary school, and had studied abroad in Mexico as an undergraduate student, Dominican Spanish was initially difficult for me to understand and was full of unfamiliar colloquialisms. But the language barrier didn’t impact my ability to comprehend the importance of the words compartir and confianza. As soon as I was en route to the Dominican Republic, I noticed the kindness of its citizens—even on the plane a woman offered her pen to me for my customs form.</p>
<p>I immediately felt at home with my preceptor (Dr. Miguel Garcia) and his extended family, including his sisters who were my neighbors. Dr. Garcia and I quickly discovered that we have many things in common—we both briefly studied in Mexico, studied psychology, work in primary care and with adolescents, and he initially studied to be a priest, whereas my brother is a Catholic priest.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dr.-Garcia-and-Meaghan.jpg" rel="lightbox[5862]" title="My Long-term Volunteer Experience in the D.R."><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5865" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Dr. Garcia and Meaghan" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dr.-Garcia-and-Meaghan-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>With Dr. Garcia, I worked in the public hospital in the mornings, mainly shadowing his work in psychology and with adolescent patients. There, I saw a number of astounding cases—a twelve year old with severe anxiety who was only in the first grade; his mother, who also had anxiety resulting from an abusive relationship; a 14 year old who was pregnant with a 49 year old partner, and many others.</p>
<p>In the afternoons, we rotated through the various <em>bateys</em>—rural, low-income community settlements surrounded by banana fields. In the bateys, the health promoters specifically recruited children for me to examine for sick visits, and we measured children from ages zero to five years to determine their nutritional status and their needs for referral and/or intervention.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5867" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="In a Timmy Clinic in the bateys" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/In-Timmy-Clinic-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<div>
<p>While working in the bateys, I witnessed a key example of sharing (<em>compartir</em>) via the public spaces that the health promoters made available to us. They assured us that we could use any possible space for our health care visits—churches, schools, sewing rooms, and even an outdoor space where cattle meandered through and a new litter of puppies was thriving.</p>
<p>At the latter site, I watched the paper charts blow in the wind, and was amazed at the basic healthcare challenges this community faced. I, personally, struggled to understand many of the patients’ names, and quickly learned that many parents couldn’t recount their child’s birth date or even birth year—which was essential in accurately determining age in months and thus age-appropriate body measurements. Often, young children living in the bateys helped me translate Creole or provided me with patient names. Aside from language barriers, we faced other challenges like the oppressive heat, urine pregnancy tests that were falsely negative, frequent shortages of medications, and the subsequent substitutions (we filled our own prescriptions). But, as Dr. Garcia wisely put it, in spite of the challenges we had to practice with “our mind, skills and heart.” We often left the bateys with gifts of mangoes and bananas.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Growth-Chart-for-Baby.jpg" rel="lightbox[5862]" title="My Long-term Volunteer Experience in the D.R."><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5866" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Growth Chart Measurements for Baby Patient" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Growth-Chart-for-Baby-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Many of our patients suffered from a frequent <em>gripe</em> (common cold), caused by overcrowded conditions and empiric treatment for presumed intestinal parasites. We did our best to provide some symptomatic relief, which meant a lot to the patients and their families—even offering vitamins provided some comfort. I encountered several interesting physical diagnoses while working in the bateys as well, including mumps (very rarely seen in the US due to widespread vaccination), cutaneous herpes, and a three year old girl who had gripe, and whose father mentioned that she said very few words—we later found her to presumably be deaf.</p>
<p>A health promoter, who asked me to review a death record of an infant, illustrated the culture of <em>confianza</em> to me. Two weeks later in the batey, the deceased infant’s mother approached me and asked me details about how her baby could have possibly died. She had two other healthy children, and it had been a normal full term pregnancy, but she noted that the baby was born very white in color, cried initially, then died a few hours later upon transport to a larger city. She was unclear why this happened and was looking for answers. The death record mentioned a large bleed in the brain and insufficient oxygen to the brain. I tried to explain the risk factors for this, none of which she seemed to have, and then explained that sometimes we simply do not know why these things occur.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jose-with-a-young-patient.jpg" rel="lightbox[5862]" title="My Long-term Volunteer Experience in the D.R."><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5868" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Jose with a young patient" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jose-with-a-young-patient-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>A mother form one of the bateys illustrated another case of <em>confianza</em> to me when she called Dr. Garcia after her child was thought to have appendicitis. She was in the public hospital’s emergency department, and no one in town was comfortable performing surgery or providing anesthesia since she was only eight years old. We were on our way to a batey, but after Dr. Garcia made many unfruitful calls, we turned around and met her at the hospital. Dr. Garcia took one look at the patient’s face and believed it to be the face of a child with appendicitis. We carried her out of the hospital—with her IV fluids in tow—and took her to a bus stop, where we gave her mother some money so that she could go to a higher-level hospital. We later heard that she had her appendix taken out that same night. A catastrophe was avoided by getting her to pediatric-specific care.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all cases ended as successfully. One of Dr. Garcia’s patients, an elderly man, died earlier in the month after he presented to the emergency department with vague symptoms. The symptoms were misunderstood (perhaps due to a language barrier) and he was sent home, where he later died of a presumed heart attack.</p>
<p>At the end of my month in the Dominican Republic, one of Timmy’s medical teams came to support our work. I was amazed to see the teamwork present among a group of people who were mostly strangers prior to this week—including optometrists, pharmacists, a cardiologist, an obstetrician, a pediatric ophthalmologist, a family practitioner, undergraduates and medical students alike. In just five days, we treated 561 total patients. During the team’s trips to the bateys, I saw some of the same children from my prior visits, and was pleased to see they had some continuity of care.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Posing-with-kids-in-clinic.jpg" rel="lightbox[5862]" title="My Long-term Volunteer Experience in the D.R."><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5870" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" alt="Posing with kids in clinic" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Posing-with-kids-in-clinic-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Altogether, it was great working with the “Take a Trip with Timmy” winner, Kirsten Devin, coordinating with Jose Vazquez (Timmy’s on-the-ground staff member), and working with Karina Mehta (an undergraduate and two-time trip leader for Timmy’s Washington University medical team). I also got to see TimmyCare (an electronic medical record) initiated in the Dominican Republic (by Zach Wright, Muz Ahmed and Lambo Jayapalan) for the first time!</p>

<p>It’s getting humid in Indianapolis, the pollen count is high, and the sweet aroma of fresh cut grass wafting in and out of open windows can only mean one thing—spring is in the air, and summer isn’t far behind. As we delve into June at the Timmy Indy office, we’re finally settling into our normal routines, glad to have the hustle and bustle of the early spring months behind us. Like many Hoosiers (and plenty of other folks across the country), Timmy underwent a lot of changes this season in our annual spring-cleaning-frenzy. And like our counterparts, we had to make some tough decisions (*to keep or not to keep?!), inevitably parting with some once cherished Timmy heirlooms and making our best efforts to organize the rest.</p>
<p>Spring cleaning is always bittersweet—bitter are the dust clouds, the stacks of old files, and the boxes of unclaimed electrical cords that seem to span endlessly on, tormenting any hopes of a quick clean-up. But sweet is the sense of nostalgia—the memories of a not so far off past that made us, and in this case, Timmy Global Health, who we are today.</p>
<p>Much like the act of spring cleaning, this blog post is, in itself, bittersweet. Over the course of the past few months we’ve said goodbye to a number of incredible Timmy staff members who are moving on to new and exciting chapters of their lives. Our former Programs Coordinator, Kathy Morris, took on a new role as a volunteer coordinator with her church in April, and our Medical Programs Coordinators August Longino, Nitin Shrivastava, and Alyson Davidson all recently transitioned out of their positions in Ecuador, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic and into the classroom—preparing for and beginning their medical school journeys.</p>
<p>While it was indeed bittersweet to see them leave, we are thrilled to welcome on the newest members of the Timmy Team—individuals that we know will continue to shape this organization into an even stronger catalyst for global change. Tammy Truong, a former IU Timmy and participant on the inaugural student trip to Guatemala, is now leading our medical programs in the Amazon Basin. Ashley Aue, who spent the past two years working in various capacities for our partner Pop Wuj, is now heading up Timmy’s projects in Guatemala. Melissa Vargas, former Purdue Timmy and intern in the D.R., joins the Ecuador staff as our Medical Programs Assistant, while Jose Vazquez is busy cultivating a relationship with our partner organization Banelino in the D.R. And here in Indianapolis, we are relishing the addition of our Programs Assistant and Volunteer Coordinator Katherine Horn, while anxiously awaiting the arrival of our new Programs Coordinator, Alyssa Rossodivita in mid-June.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, spring comes in like a lion—it’s categorized by thunderstorms, rapid fluctuations in temperature, and other unpredictable climate changes that can cover your garden in frost after it just began to bloom. But, if you’re lucky, it goes out like a lamb&#8230; In the same way that our whirlwind of staff changes clambered through the organization like a roaring lion in the early spring months, everything is finally starting to settle back into place, just in time for the rush of medical trips this summer!</p>
<p>Our spring-cleaning around the office is largely complete as well, and we’re utilizing some of the freed up space to display new prints of our international clinics—each of which present us with the same sense of nostalgia we felt as we cleared a place for them. Below are some photos of the newly redecorated office, and a few snapshots from our other spring-cleaning efforts. We hope they all spark some of the same memories for you as they did for us! (Many thanks to Gabrielle Cheikh Photography for taking the photos of our office!)</p>

<hr style="width: 100%;" width="100%" />
<p>Owning knowledge is a good thing—but sharing it is even better. And that’s what Timmy Global Health is doing in Ecuador. We’re passing the torch, sharing knowledge, and using education and awareness to train capable and autonomous community health promoters to support our patients in the developing world. Of course, in an ideal world, Timmy wouldn’t need to intervene in Ecuadorian communities, via health promoters or any of our other public health initiatives. But as you and I both know, this is no ideal world. Countless people are in need of support, and access to medical care is at the top of the list.</p>
<p>For more than fifteen years, Timmy has been working diligently to treat patients and provide year-round support to communities that otherwise have little to no access to primary care or advanced health services. A majority of Timmy’s work abroad involves treatment and follow-up care for patients that are diagnosed in their mobile medical clinics. But recently, Timmy has taken advantage of a new opportunity to partner up with university students to expand its service provision to include preventative health care practices as well.</p>
<p>The goal of “prevention” is to curb diseases before they start—to address the root of a health issue before it actually becomes a problem. We put this objective into action in April 2013, when we partnered with the University of Cincinnati Med School to launch our first public health trip to Quito and Tena. Working with U of C medical students, we called together the health promoters of the local communities to participate in health workshops or “charlas,” designed to highlight critical prevention methods that could reach every community member. Timmy’s health promoters are community leaders—men and women who establish the link between the local population and Timmy’s staff and volunteers. They are a critical part of Timmy’s public health initiatives because they are individuals that the community members trust with their health related questions and concerns, and they have an established rapport with each and every household in the community.</p>
<p>Throughout the public health trip we divided our time between Quito and Tena in order to to maximize the amount of health promoters that could attend the workshops. The idea was not just to teach the local promoters, but also to learn from them in a mutually beneficial exchange. The team quickly learned that they had to adjust their approach and adapt their message to the local way of living. Some of the biggest hurdles to public health in the communities we visited were a lack of access to various nutritious foods, no safe-water sources, and other money-related limitations.</p>
<p>Each workshop was led by a different group of medical students and/or medical residents. Through discussions, skits, and other interactive activities they tackled sessions related to diabetes, hypertension, geriatrics, mental illness, neonatal and infant care, breastfeeding, and hernias. At the end of the two-day workshops, the health promoters received a certificate to verify their participation and preparedness for community health initiatives. Although prevention was a central part of this medical trip, the team still set up mobile medical clinics as well, and continued to provide support and treat Timmy’s patients. Moreover, clinic days were a great opportunity for health promoters to practice what they had been taught!</p>
<p>Below is a photo essay highlighting different moments from the public health trip. I hope that it paints a good picture of the different kinds of capacity building and community development projects that Timmy is now integrating into its long-term service provision.</p>

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Becky-and-Dona-Ana-3.png" rel="lightbox[5727]" title="Becky and Dona Ana in Xela"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5728" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Becky and Dona Ana in Xela" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Becky-and-Dona-Ana-3-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Becky Lomax-Sumner, one of Timmy Global Health’s Medicine Women, is busy. She is in charge of half of Timmy’s medicine procurement and redistribution–a component of Timmy’s work that distributed approximately $2.6 million worth of medicines in 2012. Officially joining the team in 2001, Becky has been volunteering at Timmy since its infancy. While the scale of Timmy’s work has grown by leaps and bounds over the years—requiring more and more oversight—Becky’s commitment has been unwavering. As a small tribute to her dozen years with Timmy, I thought I’d catch up with her, ask her a few questions, and share her Timmy story with everyone just in time for National Volunteer Week (April 21-27, 2013).</p>
<p>Last week, Becky and I met up around lunchtime at Timmy’s headquarters near downtown Indianapolis and walked across the street to Subway—a frequent staff lunch spot.</p>
<p>Before taking my first bite, I thought I’d start with the basics: “So, where are you from?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Rockville,” she responded. Rockville, Indiana is a small town in Parke County on the western side of the state. It’s more widely known as the “Covered Bridge Capital of the World” and home to Turkey Run Sate Park. Anyone who knows Becky knows that she’s an avid bird watcher (or birder). She confirmed that her time growing up in Rockville influenced her love of the outdoors.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Becky-and-Dona-Ana-2.png" rel="lightbox[5727]" title="Becky and Dona Ana in Timmy Clinic"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5729" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Becky and Dona Ana in Timmy Clinic" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Becky-and-Dona-Ana-2-224x300.png" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>I moved onto questions about her high school experiences, and then college. She graduated from Purdue University with a degree in microbiology. Her love of science and work in labs led her to a master’s level program at the University of Chicago. From there, she moved onto hospital work in Indiana and Illinois, leading laboratory projects that primarily focused on infectious disease. For clinical microbiologists like Becky, there’s not much patient contact in the lab. For that reason, she told me, she enjoyed the extra interaction she was able to have with students and patients on Timmy’s medical trips.</p>
<p>Becky was quick to point out that her role with Timmy coincides perfectly with her personal and professional interests—She gets to work in health and medicine while also working alongside energetic college students and knowledgeable medical professionals. She emphasized that working with Timmy students has always been one of the best parts of her position.</p>
<p>Next question, a question I’ve always been personally curious about: “How’d you meet Dr. Chuck?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I called up Scott Keller (Timmy’s former Executive Director),” she explained. In early 2001, Becky wanted to volunteer with pediatric patients, and she had heard about the <em>Timmy Foundation, </em>which at the time was highly-focused on helping underserved children abroad. “Scott asked me, ‘Do you want to be in charge of our donated medicines?’” Clearly the answer was a resolute yes!</p>
<p>Becky was hired on the spot and was immediately tasked with the responsibility of sorting all of Timmy’s medicines—which were crammed into Dr. Chuck’s garage in Zionsville.</p>
<p>“I was sorting meds in Chuck’s garage one day, and a man who I didn’t recognize walked in,” Becky recalled. “The man asked who I was. And I told him I’m the woman in charge of all the medicines. Who are you?’”</p>
<p>“Dr. Chuck Dietzen,” he responded.</p>
<p>Even though Becky’s introduction to Timmy, its founder, and her new position were unorthodox to say the least, she has always been a dependable and “go-to” volunteer. Becky entered the Timmy community at a time when change was a constant. Nearly every year after she started, the organization relocated the medical warehouse. In addition to Chuck’s garage, Becky and Susie (Timmy’s other medicine woman) have worked out of a warehouse at Shadeland and 55th, Eagle Creek’s airport hanger, and a building on the west side of Indianapolis near I-465. Becky laughs when she recalls working out of one space in particular—the basement in Glendale Mall! Each of these “warehouses” were spaces donated by board members or connections that Dr. Chuck had made.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Old-Med-Warehouse.png" rel="lightbox[5727]" title="Old Med Warehouse"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5730" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Old Med Warehouse" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Old-Med-Warehouse-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>For Becky, the turning point in Timmy’s 16-year history was in 2005 when Timmy moved into its current building near downtown Indianapolis. Becky rolls her eyes whenever she remembers the chaos she used to endure on mornings when 5 or 6 medical teams would leave from the old buildings on the same day. The new building—and her new pharmacy—were much bigger, and would allow for organizational growth – which soon came.</p>
<p>“What was your most memorable Timmy trip?” I asked. Becky has traveled 19 times to Timmy’s partner organizations in Guatemala and Jamaica. She has a lot of stories to choose from.</p>
<p>Without hesitation though, she recalled a story from her second trip to Guatemala in 2008. The story involves a midwife named Doña Ana – who is both a community leader and a liaison between Timmy, its partner organization Pop-Wuj in Xela, and Timmy’s patient population in a rural Guatemalan community. At that time, Timmy had three infant incubators sitting in the medical warehouse that had been donated by St. Vincent Hospital. Becky decided to try to get one of those incubators to Guatemala for Doña Ana.</p>
<p>A close friend of Becky’s, Doug Moore, was gracious enough to donate a flight to Guatemala in his private jet so that she could travel with the incubator and a plane-full of other supplies for Doña Ana. Becky was all smiles as she explained how the situation had unfolded. Today, the incubator is still at Doña Ana’s clinic in Guatemala, and is one of just three incubators in the entire city of Xela. Becky keeps a picture of herself and Doña Ana hanging prominently over her desk in the basement pharmacy in Timmy’s warehouse—a constant reminder of that meaningful trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Becky-and-Dona-Ana.png" rel="lightbox[5727]" title="Becky and Dona Ana in Airport"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5732 alignleft" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Becky and Dona Ana in Airport" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Becky-and-Dona-Ana-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Our lunchtime chat flew by, and in no time at all came to a close. But as we moved back towards headquarters, Becky and I kept the conversation going.</p>
<p>She was anxious to talk about Susie, Timmy’s other Medicine Woman. Together, the two Medicine Women spend hundreds of hours each year organizing medicines in Timmy’s warehouse. They enjoy the camaraderie and the friendship, and have learned a great deal from each other over the years.</p>
<p>Back inside headquarters, Becky headed downstairs to her pharmacy where she is already making arrangements for the next round of Timmy medical trips in May. Despite having volunteered with Timmy for over 12 years, Becky tackles her projects in the medical warehouse with the spirit and energy of someone who’s volunteering with Timmy for the first time—and she says, “You think 12 years is a long time?

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jose-and-child-in-the-D.R..png" rel="lightbox[5719]" title="Jose and child in the D.R."><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5720" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Jose and child in the D.R." src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jose-and-child-in-the-D.R.-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I’ve recently completed 18 months of service as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer. I originally sought out placement as a volunteer to extend what I had witnessed and felt while studying abroad in Sierra Leone. Though I only lived in a tribal village for three weeks, it was enough to categorize need, yet also experience the vitality and the potential of the community. It was a time in which I found a rawness within me that I hadn’t felt before—having to strip myself of my lifestyle in the U.S. and submerge myself into something unknown and thrilling at the same time. Simply, my inspiration to join Peace Corps was wanting the opportunity to live somewhere totally different, delve myself into a new culture, and come back to the states with a perspective that would allow me to feel more ‘complete,’ for a lack of a better word.</p>
<p>My experience in the D.R. has been all of that and so much more. Joining Peace Corps has provided me with an opportunity to live in an environment completely different from the one I had in the states—delving into music, food and culture has been so fun! In this placement I’ve also been able to apply concepts that I learned as an undergrad to my work, especially as they pertain to disease transmission, treatment, and prevention.</p>
<p>The first project site that I was stationed at with Peace Corps was in Pimentel, Duarte Province.  My primary projects revolved around working with youth and women’s groups with health sector initiatives to prevent the contraction of HIV and advocate about teen pregnancy and mother/infant health. In December 2012, group leaders and I graduated a total of six youth groups and four women’s groups in the above topics.  Some of the featured group work that we used were an HIV-themed play for World AIDS Day that received PEPFAR Funding with the youth groups and income generation projects with the women’s groups.</p>
<p>Within the past months, I’ve phased out my projects in Pimentel, and have taken on a new Medical Project Coordinator position with Timmy Global Health in Monte Cristi. It’s been living in Monte Cristi for about four weeks, but it was a three-month transition process.  I owe a ton to Alyson Davidson, who was the first Timmy volunteer in the DR, and whose position I’ll be taking over.  I spent a week on her couch as she showed me the ropes in clinic visits, medical trip organization, and life in the new town in general. She’ll be leaving the D.R. soon to attend medical school back in the sate, and I hope I’ll be able to fill her shoes and help to build upon what she’s initiated.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jose-and-Alyson-MC.png" rel="lightbox[5719]" title="Jose and Alyson, MC"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5723" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Jose and Alyson, MC" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jose-and-Alyson-MC-300x168.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>Before I go into more of my own story, I should share some more details about Timmy’s partner organization in the Dominican Republic: Banelino. Banelino is a fair trade banana cooperative that ships primarily to European markets. For every box of bananas that Banelino ships, it receives $1 USD.  The monies received are then collected and shifted to Banelino’s social programs—one of which includes health services. Banelino’s health program has been in full force since 2002, and is nearing its one-year anniversary as a partner of Timmy Global Health. Banelino’s health program currently serves a total of 11 communities, in both the provinces of Monte Cristi and Valverde, reaching both cooperative workers and community members.  Banelino’s health team includes two doctors, one nurse, and a team of about 15 health promoters that help to provide primary care services, a vaccination program, trainings for health promoters in health related topics, and even an ambulance for emergency transport.</p>
<p>Two of the five communities that we serve in the Monte Cristi area have a predominant Haitian population. Haitian families migrate to the D.R. to work mostly in agriculture. In Monte Cristi, agriculture is predominantly focused on banana production.  All of the communities that Timmy/Banelino operate in are very marginalized due to their rural location, as well as poor road conditions and other logistical challenges that limit access to health services. Our Haitian patients are further marginalized due to language and cultural barriers that they face.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Medical-record.jpg" rel="lightbox[5719]" title="Medical record project Example"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5722 alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Medical record project Example" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Medical-record-168x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="300" /></a>Recently, Alyson and I have started a photo campaign to help us manage the medical records of our Haitian patients. The task has involved two full days of work in predominantly Haitian-migrant communities where we’ve discarded duplicate folders, and in their place, have taken pictures to match faces with each available patient record. We intend that this effort will allow a more efficient way of sorting through the records when it comes to weekly medical clinics as well as Timmy medical trips. A challenge to this new record-management system however, is the reality of migration patters. On one of the site visit days, our translator informed us that about 18 Haitians had left for Haiti on the same day! This poses the challenge of not knowing who these patients were, and thus, leaving a portion of the picture project finished until they (hopefully) return. Regardless, 108 pictures have been developed and placed in records, and we’re still counting! We consider this a great success.</p>
<p>In addition to the photo project, Alyson and I are also collaborating on strengthening the current patient referral system.  During clinic days and during Timmy’s primary care medical trips, some patients are referred for advanced care or testing. Timmy takes charge of the financial aspect of the project, and Banelino helps to coordinate the logistics for referring the patients to specialized clinics in Monte Cristi and throughout the country. We intend for the referral program to continue to grow as we take on new patients, and we believe that through it, Timmy and Banelino will be able to promote a greater sense of sustainability with the complete provision of health services to our patients.</p>
<p>It was August 2012 when I arrived to Monte Cristi for the first time.  I’d never participate in a medical trip before (with Timmy Global Health or otherwise), and I looked forward to translating for what was, at the time, just the second medical trip Timmy had coordinated with Banelino. I could never have imagined that just a few months later, I would be interviewing for the MPC position, as well as taking the lead on these programs as of March 2013!  The trek thus far has been very exciting.  I’m still getting a gauge for what this role will fully entail, but regardless, I’m stoked for what will come. And I’m thrilled to be a part of this Timmy-Banelino partnership, all in the spirit of a Peace Corps volunteer.</p>

<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<p>TimmyCare is a web-based EMR developed in-house for Timmy Global Health. It’s truly amazing, and best of all, it requires ZERO paper. Paper is the enemy. If TimmyCare was a person, it would be a vegan. It would have dreadlocks, and eat only broccoli (that it planted itself). It would plant trees in its spare time and it would also run for president and win…But then turn the job down because it wasn’t involved enough. It would also eat lots of avocados.</p>
<p><em>Inception</em></p>
<p>TimmyCare’s inception began during a medical trip in November 2011 that took a group of doctors and <a title="Microsoft Timmy Team" href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/microsoft/">a team of volunteers from Microsoft</a> (Seattle, WA) to Tena, Ecuador. Upon observing how the clinic was run, a group of the volunteers (to their utter dismay) attempted to write a software program to store the data collected by the paper patient-intake forms. Written during (and mainly after) clinic hours, powered by an antique generator that supplied both power and carcinogens, on a single machine that would barely serve as a paperweight at Microsoft, TimmyCare v0 was born.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5699 alignleft" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; cursor: default; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Muz Photo" alt="" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Muz-Photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>It succeeded in its objective to store the data collected on the paper forms, but not much else. After running for the few remaining clinic days, it was apparent that TimmyCare was not scalable. Charting hundreds of patient intakes on a single machine proved to be far too time consuming, and usually resulted in degenerative neurological disorders. Nevertheless—aside from the brain hemorrhaging that ensued from its use—TimmyCare had the potential to not only make Timmy’s clinics more efficient, but also to give Timmy insight into its data, something previously impossible.</p>
<p>Henceforth was born the EMR that would need to run in real time during clinic—often in remote locations that lacked Internet, power, and sometimes even shelter from the elements. The software would have to run fast enough to allow Timmy to see upwards of a hundred patients a day, be intuitive enough for medical and student volunteers to learn on the fly, advanced enough to justify the investment and development effort, and cost nearly nothing.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5701 alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 10px;" title="TimmyCare &quot;Vitals&quot; Screenshot" alt="" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vitals-300x189.png" width="300" height="189" /></p>
<p><em>Version 1.0</em></p>
<p>Version 1.0 of TimmyCare began with a complete re-write in Redmond, WA by two software engineers who were on the initial 2011 medical trip. The verb “re-write” does a great disservice to the actual act that was performed as code was purged and memories were repressed&#8230; The focus was on digitizing the paper intake forms, schematizing a database that would allow for extensibility, and allowing the software to run on as many machines as possible, simultaneously. Since all of the machines used in Timmy’s clinics would be donations (and therefor older than time itself), the program couldn’t make any assumptions about the hardware it was running on.</p>
<p>Given those requirements, the clouds parted and it became clear that we should run TimmyCare as a website! A website would enable nearly any hardware asset to access the system, provided it had a browser. The website model inherently facilitated simultaneous processing of a patient, something paper—to its total and utter disappointment—would not allow. As a website, scaling TimmyCare to work with more devices, clinics, and providers was rather trivial, and destroyed zero rainforests in the process.</p>
<p>Fast forward 1 year to November 2012: the new version was deployed once again in Tena, Ecuador. A server and router were donated, along with 8 archaic laptops (each weighing slightly less than a car), and 5 inexpensive tablets, which turned on just over 40% of the time. The data collected from the v0 offering which was still running in Tena, was migrated to the new schematized database. Each clinic day, hosted in a remote village deep within the rainforest, was transformed into a mini datacenter. Bushes were burned, grounds were cleared, and Wi-Fi networks were broadcasted. No one was hurt, directly.</p>
<p>To our dismay, there were many issues with the software in that deployment. It was slow, its uptime wasn’t very high, and it wasn’t intuitive for the doctors or nurses. In its defense, the students loved it—but they don’t save lives (yet), so it doesn’t matter what they think really. Each night, team TimmyCare would assemble with the medical professionals and take notes as they bashed the software without restraint. Then we would make our immediate changes, which were deployed and tested the next day in clinic.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-5706 alignleft" title="The Pharm is SO Fast" alt="" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Pharm.Post-it-281x300.png" width="281" height="300" /></p>
<p><em>The Aftermath</em></p>
<p>By the end of that medical trip, TimmyCare was far more stable, hardly crashed at all, and was finally beginning to please the doctors, all the while making the Triage and Pharmacy stations the fastest they had ever operated!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> The main objective was close to complete by this point: Timmy Global Health was finally able to harvest data from its medical trips, and the EMR-enabled clinic was actually running faster than it had with paper patient-intake forms. (The reader is encouraged to re-read that last sentence multiple times).</p>
<p>At this point, the question of whether TimmyCare is actually being useful is still not answered, but we’ve at least overcome the question of it being usable! To answer the usefulness question, TimmyCare version 2.0 needs to demonstrate value added. So for now, it’s back to the lab again! More updates to come soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hernia-patient.jpg" rel="lightbox[5687]" title="hernia patient"><img class="size-full wp-image-5691 alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="hernia patient" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hernia-patient.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Timmy Global Health (Timmy) has developed a knack for overcoming obstacles on the ground. Whether these barriers to health derive from logistical, financial, or other potential challenges, Timmy’s staff is well equipped to solve issues related to getting our patients the critical treatments they need. One of the biggest challenges that Timmy—and every other international medical aid &amp; relief organization—face is providing continuity of care. While short-term medical trips provide valuable services to many patients (i.e. disbursement of vitamins, anti-parasitic meds, health education, etc.), patients with chronic diseases require a much more intricate and sustainable health system. Many of Timmy’s chronic patients rely on daily medications, and in the absence of Timmy’s primary care clinics, their prescribed treatments are costly and difficult to come by.</p>
<p>I have witnessed these challenges time and again through my work with Timmy. One of the most recent scenarios took place during the January 2013 DePauw University medical trip to the Napo Province, where our Timmy physicians encountered two complex neurological patients—Michael and Alberto—both diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Managing chronic treatment plans for patients with hypertension and diabetes is challenging enough in the Amazon Basin, but this disease takes it to another level.</p>
<p>Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, degenerative neurological disease that can present in several forms, and is caused by a loss of dopamine cells in the substancia nigra—a specific region of the midbrain. The loss of the dopamine cells in the midbrain causes a certain movement disorder with rigidity, tremors (shaking), an unstable gait, and a loss of muscle control called akinesia. Although there is no present cure for Parkinson’s disease, dopamine and dopamine agonists are typically used to improve the symptoms. In the western world, new therapeutic strategies such as deep brain stimulation (electro stimulator inserted by surgery in the brain) are common, and costs for treatment average out to be an affordable $30 USD per month.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Migueal1.png" rel="lightbox[5687]" title="Alberto and Miguel"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5692" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Alberto and Miguel" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Migueal1-300x204.png" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>Dr. Katharina Stengl—an Austrian Neurologist who recently served as a long-term Timmy volunteer—treated Michael and Alberto when they arrived at Timmy’s primary care clinics in the communities of Tamia Urku and San Rafael, respectively. (<a title="Dr. Stengel Blog Post" href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2013/02/15/from-berlin-to-tena-adapting-western-medicine-to-rural-needs/%20">Click Here</a> to read a blog post from Dr. Stengl). Although neither patient had ever been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, nor received dopamine or any other treatments, they both presented with the classical clinical symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson`s syndrome (rigor, tremor and severe akinesia). And both experienced an onset of the disease within the last 4 years. Due to multiple years without treatment, the disease had progressed at an alarming rate for Michael and Alberto. Sadly, Alberto was hospitalized on the same day that he came to clinic, due to severe dysphagia that had caused weight loss and an inability to swallow.</p>
<p>After seeing both patients in Timmy’s clinics, Dr. Stengl referred them to the Stadler Richter Hospital in Archidona, so that she could start their treatments and oversee their progress. Before their follow-up appointments, she had diligently requested specific neurological medications, but unfortunately the meds did not arrive. Dr. Stengal’s time as a long-term volunteer with Timmy Global Health came to a close before she could oversee treatment for these patients. Without another neurologist on staff at Stadler-Richter Hospital to monitor Alberto and Michael’s Parkinson’s treatment, they would have to travel to another Timmy referral destination, Tierra Nueva in Quito.</p>
<p>But the search for a proper care facility for Alberto and Michael encountered another obstacle. As Timmy staff and partners arranged the logistical details for their trip to Quito, we quickly discovered that Tierra Nueva no longer had a neurologist on staff either. After searching high and low for another option, someone finally suggested that we reach out to a former Tierra Nueva neurologist, Dr. Michael Andrade, who now works in public health clinics in other parts of Quito.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Alberto1_edited.png" rel="lightbox[5687]" title="Alberto with Health Promoter"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5693" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Alberto with Health Promoter" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Alberto1_edited-300x217.png" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a></p>
<p>Dr. Andrade agreed to schedule a consult for both Alberto and Michael.  Finally, nearly a month and a half after Dr. Stengl initially saw them on the January brigade, they arrived in Quito for their referral. Dr. Andrade assessed both patients, ordered blood labs, and ran tests. The patients had to return to their homes in the Amazon Basin while the tests and labs were processed, and then made a second trip to Quito a few days later to receive the results and begin their medical treatment. Upon their return, Dr. Andrade explained to each patient their medical situation, confirming both diagnoses of Parkinson’s disease, and outlining a treatment plan moving forward. He prescribed medications for each patient, which Timmy Global Health purchased immediately after leaving the clinic.</p>
<p>In order to monitor Alberto and Michael’s treatment and progress, both patients scheduled a second follow-up appointment at Dr. Andrade’s Quito clinic for late April. By the end of February, just a few days after the start of their treatments, both patients were becoming accustomed to their new meds and showed signs of improvement. They will continue to receive treatment and monthly follow-up services from Dr. Andrade, and Timmy Global Health will continue to work with Dr. Andrade for other neurological cases in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Miguel2_edited.png" rel="lightbox[5687]" title="Miguel with Dr. Andrade"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5694" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Miguel with Dr. Andrade" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Miguel2_edited-300x208.png" alt="" width="300" height="208" /></a>Alberto and Michael’s stories show Timmy Global Health’s level of dedication and persistence. Staff members in Ecuador spent nearly 2 months attempting to locate a reliable neurologist and despite many obstacles, they refused to give up—making every effort to ensure that Alberto and Michael had access to the care they needed. But for Timmy Staff members, this story is the rule, not the exception. Timmy is dedicated to its communities and its patients—we’ve made a commitment and a promise to them. We are determined to get results for our patients and we are willing to find solutions, no matter where we have to go or how hard we have to look. And this “never-give-up” mentality is making a difference, one patient at a time.</p>

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hannah-young-patients-and-me-at-Pop-Wuj.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Hannah, young patients, and me at Pop Wuj"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5630 alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Hannah, young patients, and me at Pop Wuj" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hannah-young-patients-and-me-at-Pop-Wuj-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>This marks my third year as a member of the IU Timmy Global Health student chapter, and my second time volunteering on a medical trip to Guatemala during my Spring Break. My first trip was a true eye-opening experience—I had never been in such close proximity to severe poverty and education disparities, yet such pure happiness. Within 24 hours of arriving in Guatemala, I came to realize that I wasn’t necessarily there to change peoples’ lives. Instead—the people I met were going to change mine.</p>
<p>The year after my first Timmy trip was an eventful one. I developed as a person, shedding this bad habit, picking up that new one—making new friends, and shamelessly learning their stories and creating my own. I struggled through my pre-med course work and forced myself to honestly re-evaluate my own ambitions. Ultimately, I decided to become a nurse practitioner, a career I believe is much better suited to my life goals. During that time, I also went back to my hometown in Mexico—to visit my grandmother, cousins, aunts, and uncles—for the first time in 15 years. While there, my experiences from my Timmy trip to Guatemala replayed in my mind, and I marveled at the parallels in my emotions while in both countries. Never have I felt as happy as when I am in Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
<p>I think all these events and realizations leading up to my second trip had a significant influence on my perspective as I took off for Guatemala for the second time. It may be blunt of me to say, but I no longer felt like an outsider—like I was only a Timmy student going to Guatemala for just one week. Instead, the second time around, it felt as if I was supposed to be there—not as a “savior” or anything self-centered like that, but as if this trip was just a natural chapter in my life story. Throughout the trip, I never ceased to be amazed by how much more my mind expanded and my heart grew. I learned so much from last year’s trip that it was difficult to imagine that I would gain anything more the second time around—but I did. And I believe, most of all, that shows how much more living I need to do.</p>
<p>With this blog post, I would like to share with you—Timmy’s network—what exactly Timmy students do on these trips. Below is a day-by-day account of our week of clinic, and the weekends before and after. Each story is unique, of course, and my views and thoughts do not reflect those of my fellow Timmy members. However, I hope that this will give you a better understanding of why so many people have a special place in their hearts for this organization, and why so many people proudly proclaim, <a title="Watch a Timmy Video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfJ62PDSA">“I am Timmy.”</a></p>

The streets are made of cobblestones, the churches are ornate and breathtaking on the inside and out, and flowers, delicate and bright, cling to the trees and bushes. In Antigua, our “Team” of medical professional volunteers, students, and Timmy’s Medical Programs Coordinator were all introduced to each other for the first time. We spent a long part of that night on the roof of our hotel, staring up into the endless sky. I considered about the week ahead, prayed that we would do more good than harm, and felt energized by the excitement of it all. And I thought—amazing how the moon, the stars, the clouds, the sun are the same no matter where you are.</p>

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Flat-Stephanie-Panajachel.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Flat Stephanie, Panajachel"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5636" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Flat Stephanie, Panajachel" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Flat-Stephanie-Panajachel-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>A group of us woke up early to walk around Antigua. Everything was calm and quiet as we roamed the town. We came across a pick-up soccer game, saw a pack of wild dogs, and greeted a group of men starting their morning ritual. When we came back for breakfast, I took a quick picture with “Flat Stephanie.” For a class project, my little cousin made me a paper doll version of her so that she could spend a week in someone else’s life. Having Flat Stephanie around proved to be very interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>After a yummy breakfast of pancakes, black beans, tortillas, fried plantains, fruit, and café con leche, we set out to sightsee once again before heading to Quetzaltenango (Xela). As we wound up the mountainside, we passed chicken buses, green trees, and fields that looked like quilted patches of tilled soil and plants. When we arrived in Xela, I saw the familiar “Cristo Vive” sign in the distance, and memories of last year’s trip flooded my mind. After lugging our suitcases to our rooms, we explored our home for the week. We saw a procession for Semana Santa, smelled delicious churros and pupusas from the vendors at the market, and simply admired the architecture of the buildings and churches. That night, Dr. Ronny Alvarado—from Timmy’s partner organization Pop Wuj—gave us what I personally call his “famous cultural competency talk.” Just as I was affected by his words last year, his sincere speech compelled me to do what I can, when I can, with what I can.</p>
<p>“We believe in making miracles”, Dr. Ronny told us. “Pop Wuj is a miracle, Timmy is a miracle, and the partnership is a miracle.” These words remind me that I don’t have to wait until the moment is right, or when I have all the resources necessary, or when I am in the right place to help someone—this moment is all I have and all I need to take action.</p>

We traveled to Concepcion Chiquirichapa. I translated for Dr. Bercovitz, a phenomenal man and doctor. From the beginning of the week started, it was clear that the medical professionals all had a deep passion for healthcare and serving patients. They were all a pleasure to meet and get to know. Dr. Bercovitz absolutely loved working with all his patients, and was adamant in learning a few Spanish phrases to help his patients feel more comfortable. He took pictures with the patients that touched his heart the most, including a very healthy and fit ninety year old man! His instinct as a human and as a doctor were remarkable. He picked up on a young female patient’s depression almost right away. As soon as Dr. Bercovitz asked her if she was sad, she started to cry, and told us her sister had passed away from cancer the year before, after losing a two-year battle. Besides teaching me the importance of listening to patients’ silent words, Dr. Bercovitz also taught me how to write prescriptions shorthand, how to listen to heartbeats and lungs, and how to examine eyes and ears.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a successful clinic day. Our cultural activity for the evening was delicious! We went to Chocolate Doña Pancha, a five-generation, family-owned chocolate factory. Doña Pancha told us about the history of chocolate, the process of making it from cocoa beans, and even the health benefits! We dipped tropical fruits into a rich chocolate fountain, drank the best hot chocolate of my life, and poured the chocolate fondue into peach yogurt. Then we were let loose to buy any and all products. Aside from all the chocolate goodness at Doña Pancha’s, this experience is vivid in my mind because I met a young girl—about 14 or 15 years old—who worked in the chocolatería. She was attentive, sweet, and had a great sense of humor. As we shared jokes and teased each other, she reminded me so much of my own cousins, bubbly and personable. I remember looking at her and noticing the differences between her and the young patient with depression from earlier. But I was also struck by the similarities. I knew they were both facing struggles of their own—medical, personal, or emotional—and that they both had dreams they wanted to accomplish. I knew because I was that age once—we all were. As I left the chocolatería, I said a small prayer for her that she may live the life she desires, safe and happy.</p>

Xeabaj was an interesting community and many of the citizens’ first language is Quiché, rather than Spanish. Therefore, a local woman named Laura and I teamed up to translate for Dr. Hobbes. From the little kids at the fluoride station, I learned how to say “hello and “thank you very much”! But for everything else, I relied on Laura.</p>
<p>Three events from this day stick out in my mind. First, we saw a tiny patient, a five-month-old baby who weighed only 5.5 pounds! He had a beautiful little face, sweet and smiling. Dr. Hobbes, a pediatrician, could not believe that he weighed so little, and had me reweigh him. So there I was, taking the clothes off this little baby, trying to soothe him so that he wouldn’t roll off the scale. It was quite the experience! What was truly remarkable, however, was their determination—Dr. Hobbes’ determination to let the mother know she had to start feeding her baby solid foods immediately, and the mother’s subsequent determination to put the baby on a nutrition program. We spent about 30 minutes with them, as opposed to the average 10-15 minute check up. Dr. Hobbes kept saying, “He could die if something isn’t done! His development could be impaired…” She spoke with such passion the baby could have been her very own child, and I was very moved by that. I realize that healthcare providers can’t always personalize their patients’ cases because it’s not healthy for the physician. But what if—for fifteen or twenty minutes of the appointment—we did as Dr. Hobbes, and viewed our patients as our friends or family? We could give patients a voice, like the one Dr. Hobbes gave that baby.</p>
<p>The second event that made this day special was playing soccer and basketball with the children. On last year’s trip, I was so focused on translating and doing what little I could to ensure the patients were receiving accurate medical attention that I overlooked opportunities to connect with patients on a personal level. I didn’t take the time to interact with the children, to play ball, or color with them, or get to know them better. I didn’t give myself that gift last year, but I vowed that for this year, I would make my experience more personable, and would try to connect with all the people I encountered, not just Timmy’s patients. And it was an incredible experience.</p>
<p>The final event occurred after we were all packed up and ready to go. I wanted to take a picture with Laura—my translation partner—because I admire her, and wanted something to remember her by. She’s such a strong woman—a single mother of seven, knowledgeable about nutrition, and home remedies for sicknesses. It was amazing to watch her interact with the women, to see her explain the treatment each one received and why it was important they take their vitamins and medications. Laura had very valuable qualities that I wish I had: she knew both the language and culture of the patients, so she knew how to most effectively communicate with the patients. She knew how to break down the medical lingo so that they would understand, how to have them take charge of their own healthcare, and how to answer all their questions. Furthermore, they were comfortable sharing information with her, which allowed Dr. Hobbes to diagnosis a more accurate treatment plan. After taking our picture, and thanking her, she told me, “You will always have a special place in my heart.” It is these people and these moments that I keep in my heart, drawing on them when I need motivation and reminders of what I wish to do in this world. <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Trama-Textiles-Xela.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Trama Textiles, Xela"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5639" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Trama Textiles, Xela" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Trama-Textiles-Xela-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>That night, we went to Trama Textiles, an organization run by widows of the soldiers of Guatemala’s Civil War. They showed us how they back-strap weave threads into beautiful scarves, bags, hammocks, journal covers, hats, headbands and more. We met two women that were a part of the organization; one was the president of Trama. She was happy to see us, and thanked Timmy for its continued support. I was grateful to witness how they had turned their tragic loss into something positive and educational for everyone in the community.</p>

<strong>Wednesday, March 13</strong></p>
<p>I woke up Wednesday with sore muscles from the soccer game—just a reminder of my promise to make more personal connections! Our third day of clinic was in Pujujil, a community whose local government works hard to serve its people. The mayor was present, as well as volunteer translators. Like Xeabaj, many of the citizens’ spoke little Spanish. In Pujujil, the common language was Mam. I worked with Dr. Newell, an ENT specialist: ears, nose and throat. He let me look into patients’ ears to see the difference between healthy and infected ears, and listen to heartbeats and lungs. I started noticing trends in the medical ailments of the people: arthritis, gastritis, blood pressure, and diabetes.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Pujujil.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Pujujil"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5640" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Pujujil" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Pujujil-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>In many cases, a likely cause of the arthritis was years of pushing, pulling, and lifting in everyday work, such as farming, tending to the livestock, cooking, washing, and other general housework. During our lunch break, we saw a very elderly man walking up a hill, carrying a grand pile of wood, strapped to his head and back, and I immediately understood. On the other hand, the gastritis, high blood pressure, and diabetes were probably due to poor nutrition, a lack of access to purified water, and other factors.</p>
<p>While Dr. Newell was seeing a young mother, her two children and her nephew, Dr. Chuck—the founder of Timmy Global Health—came from his own station and showed the boys magic tricks. That image of the delighted children, their eyes huge and shining, their smiles toothy and wide, will always stay with me. It was pure joy—I wasn’t even watching the magic tricks anymore, I was watching their expressions! We finished early that day, as many of the community members were attending the funeral of a young man. We saw the procession as they walked by, and heard their songs and their cries of sorrow.</p>
<p>On this day, I was also able to meet and play with the children. A fellow IU Timmy member and I brought out coloring books and crayons, and sat outside with the children. I loved seeing the look of pride on their faces when we praised their work and their joy when we told them they could keep their pictures and take them home. I also recognized a couple of girls that I met on last year’s brigade, and in that moment, I was so proud to be a part of Timmy Global Health—because I saw just how sustainable this organization is. For the entire year that’s passed since I last saw these girls, they had vitamins and access to medical attention. They had an opportunity to grow up healthy, and to thrive.</p>

<strong>Thursday, March 14</strong></p>
<p>Today we had the opportunity to visit Doña Ana—a midwife who has helped bring 16,000 babies into this world! Doña Ana opens up her own home to the women and families of Buena Vista and other surrounding communities, giving them access to healthcare. Her whole life is dedicated to the well being of others!</p>
<p>On this day, I translated for Dr. Judy, a sweet and inspirational doctor. After her children were grown, she enrolled in medical school and practiced as a doctor for ten years! She has a compassionate bedside manner, introducing herself in Spanish to all the patients, which I could tell they appreciated that. There was one woman in particular who reminded me of my mom and grandmother. She was so grateful, and thanked and hugged us multiple times. Another special patient that day was Andy, a small child with cerebral palsy. I didn’t get to meet him, but many of my fellow Timmy members, including my roommate, were deeply touched by his story, and shared it with me. He and his family traveled from three in the morning to Doña’s house. My roommate told me that was the day she finally felt as if she was making a difference, and that this trip was making a difference in her own life. She was amazed at how much Andy understood, at his ability to interact with people, and his eagerness to try Dr. Chuck’s magic tricks! She said, “Any ideas I had about children with disabilities were shattered today.”</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Marias!"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5641" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Marias!" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>On this day, I was also reunited with Maria and her beautiful little girl (also named Maria). I met them both last year when Maria and I double-teamed to translate for Dr. Obeime—a Timmy board member and medical volunteer. I was so happy to see her! Her little girl is in first grade now, and she told me she really likes school. Again, just like that day at Doña Pancha’s, I pictured this little girl’s future.</p>
<p>That night, we had a delicious and laidback burrito dinner at Pop Wuj, and met some of the Pop Wuj students enrolled in the clinic’s Spanish program. It was our last night in Xela, a bittersweet night. Our week was drawing to a close, and we soon had to return to school, to responsibility, to our “ordinary” lives. We had a reflection that night, and talked about how the people of Guatemala had forever touched our lives, and how we were now motivated to keep living the mission of Timmy Global Health: to use our passion and talents to empower others and ourselves to engage in health disparities.</p>
<p>We also brainstormed possible improvements to the organization and medical brigade. For example, Anne, a nurse, brought up the fact that many of our patients do not speak or read Spanish, so while they may understand how to take the medications while at the clinic, they may forget once they get home. She suggested using a picture system instead. We also discussed the idea of making posters or sheets to share information about nutrition and zoonosis to the patients while they wait for their prescriptions to be filled. I enjoyed this reflection, as it helped to put the purpose of our work into perspective, and also helped me sort my feelings. I walked out to the roof that night, to admire the stars and moon, the mountains in the distance, the “Cristo Vive” sign, the cross on top of the church, to hear the laughter and voices of people, the sounds of cars and motorcycles, and the faint music of the salsa club. I closed my eyes and let my heart take it in.</p>

<strong>Friday, March 15</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Timmy-IU-Dr.-Bercovitz-last-day-in-Xela.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Timmy IU, Dr. Bercovitz, last day in Xela"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5642" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Timmy IU, Dr. Bercovitz, last day in Xela" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Timmy-IU-Dr.-Bercovitz-last-day-in-Xela-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Our last clinic day was in Xela, at the Pop Wuj clinic. Knowing this was our last walk to the clinic, I relished the smells of the cooking food, the sight of the students rushing to school in their red and blue uniforms, the sounds of the trucks carrying fresh lettuce heads, the rocks under my feet. I looked down my favorite street, a hill so steep I wanted nothing more than to ride a bike from the top to the bottom. (I’ll go back one day to do just that.)</p>
<p>I translated for Dr. Chuck that day, and a fellow Timmy shadowed him as well. We asked him why he became a pediatrician, and how he knew medicine was the “right” career for him. It was nothing short of incredible to work with the very man who started an organization that has changed countless lives, and all for the better. We saw patients of all ages, young, old, and in between. One of my favorite cases was that of an elderly couple. They walked in together, and shared a couple of diseases: high blood pressure and diabetes. It was clear they were a team: they helped each other remember when they had last taken their medicine, scolded each other when one was not paying full attention to Dr. Chuck, and read each other’s treatment plans to make sure they understood what each was taking.</p>
<p>When Dr. Chuck told them to limit their sugar and salt intake, and exercise to lose a few pounds, they nodded their heads and thanked him profusely. As they walked out, the man told my Timmy mate and I, “Gracias, doctoras.” I smiled and said, “No, we’re not doctors.” He smiled and replied, “Not yet.” The truth of his words both terrified and excited me. One day, very soon, we will switch roles with the next generation, and we will be the ones with stethoscopes around our necks, teaching them how listen for healthy hearts.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dr.-Chuck-and-me-Pop-Wuj-Xela.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Dr. Chuck and Maria!

<p>That day, we had no cultural activity. We boarded the buses and Don Juan, our bus driver, arranged out suitcases on top of the van. We bade one last farewell to Xela—to moments lived, to patients seen, to people met, and to experiences had—and set on our way to Panajachel.</p>
<p><strong><a name="H"></a></strong><br />
<strong>Saturday, March 16 and Sunday, March 17</strong></p>
<p>The next morning, I walked out to the balcony connected directly to the room, and was overwhelmed by the beauty of Panajachel. I remembered a poster from our very first hotel in Antigua that stated, “Guatemala: Una exageración de naturaleza.” (Guatemala: an exaggeration of nature) There was a mountain to my right and left, a volcano by the lake right in front of me, red tut-tuts creaking by, and a man selling extra-fresh goat’s milk—straight from the goat itself!</p>
<p>We had the whole day to explore this gorgeous town. A group of us went on a pleasant boat ride, and as the wind rushed through my hair, the cool water covered my hand, and I felt so free! We passed by simple yet grand houses and hotels built on and among the very mountains. The whole landscape deserved to be put in a traveler’s magazine, so that its beauty could be appreciated worldwide. When we came back to shore, I went with a small group to a restaurant named Bombay Café. Here, I got to see more of Dr. Chuck’s genuine kindness. First, a young boy came in, asking if anyone wanted a shoeshine. Dr. Chuck gave him some money and told him to shine an elderly man’s shoes—someone local that deserved a shoeshine. Then two different boys came in, and Dr. Chuck and the rest of the med professionals gave them a plate of food that had barely been touched. Their actions demonstrated to me that being kind is a way of life, not counted actions that we do to fulfill our “good deed quota.”</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Timmy-IU-Xela.jpg" rel="lightbox[5627]" title="Timmy IU, Xela"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5644" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Timmy IU, Xela" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Timmy-IU-Xela-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>Later, I walked around looking at everything the vendors had to offer. There were so many things that I wanted to take home with me—leather and cloth purses, jewelry, headbands, bracelets, t-shirts, hats, and more. But most of all, I wanted to take that feeling of pure contentment home with me. I wanted to bottle up a little bit of Panajachel’s magic and beauty and take it with me, and spray a little onto my life every once in a while. Saturday night, we all stepped onto our hotel’s roof. We had a small discussion, where we learned we had been able to treat around five hundred patients throughout the week! I felt pride again, and such thanksgiving to be surrounded by those amazing individuals, who had no idea just how incredible they are, and how much they marked my life. When it was over, we headed inside, to pack for our journey back to the United States, a world so different yet so similar to the Guatemala we came to love.</p>
<p><strong><a name="I"></a></strong><br />
<strong>Back in the US</strong></p>
<p>Now that I am back in Bloomington, I find myself thinking about Guatemala, Timmy, and my life. For my cousins’ Flat Stephanie project, I had to write about our adventures together and as I wrote the letter, I got more and more excited. My cousin’s classmates will read this, and learn about other children in the world—they will dream about new places and adventures, they will learn about Timmy and what college enables you to do, they will travel the world without even leaving their desks! And as I write each word now, I realize that global medicine will be a part of my life forever, because I cannot imagine it otherwise.</p>
<p>I wish everyone could have this experience. It has changed my perspective on healthcare and on life. It’s allowed me to see first-hand that true joy comes not from material things but from other people’s joy, and finding purpose in one’s life. Thank you, Timmy, for everything.</p>

<p>It did not take too much research for me to find Timmy Global Health and realize the quality of their humanitarian work that is offered in Ecuador. As cliché as it may sound, the reason why I ventured into a medical career was to be able to use my strengths to help less fortunate people than myself and to improve the quality of life of people who have little or no access to basic healthcare. On March 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2013, I was fortunate enough to participate in my third Timmy medical trip—and my second working with the <a title="Ball State Timmy Students" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwM0FQ9Ge6s">Ball State University students</a>, who have a special place in my heart, as I completed my first Timmy trip with them back in 2012. <a title="Timmy Student Volunteers" href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/our-students/">The students</a> are highly motivated and caring and show a lot of interest in learning and developing their skills and shaping their futures. Together we spent 7 days providing medical care in Tena, Ecuador.</p>
<p>My journey to Tena was long and began in Frankfurt, Germany. After two stops in the Dominican Republic and Panama City, my flight finally landed in Quito, the capital of Ecuador. An exciting bus journey winded through green mountains giving me the feeling of life and energy. Along the road, local people were seen with livestock, carrying wood or simply walking with their families to reach the small villages and communities that they live in. With happy and loving expressions on their faces, the children waved as we drove past.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5573" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Craig and Surgery" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Craig-and-Surgery-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" /></p>
<p>We reached what I like to call “base camp” after having spending the time in the bus getting to know other medical professionals and students. It is always interesting to meet so many people, all with different backgrounds and cultures. Our accommodation was basic, clean, and managed by very friendly and helpful staff. The first evening we enjoyed a welcome dinner, which comprised of local culinary specialties. After a group discussion in the evening and a short meeting for the medical professionals, the pharmacists and the students began to prepare the medications for the first clinic day. In Tena we serve two sites per day and so we are, as medical professionals, divided into two teams for each day. Although we were all tired, the students organized and managed to prepare the clinic materials for day one.</p>
<p>Our first day took my best friend Shawn Hake (PA-C ) and I, to a small island community. In order to reach the island we had a bus journey into the Amazon rain forest, which then brought us to a river. We transferred all our equipment and medication to small canoes and set sail for a short journey across the water to the island community. The island community received us with welcoming smiles and the various teams made up of registered nurses, pharmacists and students set up clinic. The varieties of patients we see bring with them a variety of illnesses—which make it interesting for us as medical professionals and also sometimes very challenging.</p>
<p>The patients lined up and waited patiently to be seen by us. I had visited this island on the first two brigades that I had been on and it made it exciting to see familiar faces, and very gratifying when the patients recognized me. I completed 3 small surgical procedures and supplied intravenous rehydration therapy to a number of patients. The language barrier was successfully overcome with very competent translators ensuring that our patients felt comfortable. As the patient lines became shorter, the first day of clinic drew to an end.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Craig-with-Baby.png" rel="lightbox[5570]" title="Craig with Baby"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5574" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Craig with Baby" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Craig-with-Baby-300x219.png" alt="" width="300" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>Our return journey was filled with exchanging of experiences and the need for a cool shower. The joining up of the two teams back at base camp was exciting as it gave us the opportunity to hear about the other site’s experiences. The evenings were spent enjoying local food and sometimes a relaxing walk around the small town of Misahalli. The town’s inhabitants included small friendly monkeys who made it necessary for us to keep our cameras and wallets safe and tucked away! The coordination of our clinics were managed by August Longino—Timmy’s staff member on the ground in the Amazon Basin. August is a young man with incredible management and organization skills. He has established a solid trust with the local communities, and is very knowledgeable and sensitive to the needs of patients that we treat.</p>
<p>The 4 days of clinic brought with them new and exciting experiences and remained very challenging emotionally and physically. We managed to achieve a lot as a team despite our limited resources and time. The lack of resources and diagnostic possibility’s certainly sharpened my medical skills and brought me “back to basics.” It was a true cultural and medical learning experience. My heart remains in Tena, Ecuador and the Amazon basin and I look forward to my next trip in November 2013.</p>

<hr style="width: 600px;" width="600" />
<p>When I heard about the Timmy Global Health chapter at Tufts and its work in <a title="Xela, Guatemala" href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/quetzaltenango-guatemala/">Xela, Guatemala</a>, I was intrigued. As an anthropology and community health major and the daughter of a Guatemalan immigrant, I was especially excited by the opportunity to work with and learn from others in a clinical setting in Guatemala&#8217;s rural indigenous communities.<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Victoria.Pic_.jpeg" rel="lightbox[5542]" title="Victoria in Xela"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5543" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Victoria in Xela" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Victoria.Pic_-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Before traveling to Xela with Tufts Timmy Global Health, I had already been to Guatemala quite a few times to visit friends and family and had seen firsthand the extreme social inequities present within the country. These experiences forced me to recognize the many opportunities I had been given, just by virtue of being born in the U.S. For me, this relative privilege created a social obligation to effect positive change in the lives of others, both domestically and abroad. Tufts&#8217; Timmy Medical Trip offered me a wonderful opportunity to bring together this commitment to social justice with my interest in public health – and in my father&#8217;s native country!</p>
<p>Once in Guatemala, our medical team spent each day setting up a clinic in a different rural community. We were each assigned jobs on a rotating basis – interpreting for doctors, assisting in the pharmacy, or working in the triage station. I most enjoyed interpreting, as this gave me the opportunity to speak with patients for lengthy periods of time. Through this process, I had the privilege to enter their world and learn about their conception of life, pain, and illness. This experience exposed to me the power of the clinical consult beyond its medical value.</p>
<p>Of course, I served as an interpreter only for the English-speaking doctors from the U.S., not for the Guatemalan doctors who were also part of our team. I wondered how patients’ interactions with the Guatemalan doctors might have differed from their interactions with the doctors from the U.S. Having grown up hearing from my father about the U.S.’s brutal imperialist actions towards Guatemala in the 1980s, I considered how this history might affect patients’ perspectives and perceptions. Did patients regard the U.S. doctors as powerful and all-knowing, or as untrustworthy? How did this view affect their interactions with them? What are the implications of international politics for the work of international health workers?</p>
<p>When our trip came to a close, our medical team left with renewed excitement about continuing the fight for global health equity, as well as empathy for the various Guatemalan patients we had met. As we headed back to Tufts we also shared a certain level of frustration, stemming from the limitations of our resources and time.</p>
<p>Since our return from Guatemala, our Tufts Timmy Global Health chapter has carried with us the memories from our trip as a source of inspiration and motivation. Our Executive Board recently established a shadowing program between the Boston medical professionals and the Timmy chapter members. We also held a university-wide Timmy Dodgeball Tournament, through which we raised over $600 that will help to support the patients Timmy treats in Guatemala. As we continue with the semester, we intend to organize more fundraisers and more campus-wide health equity advocacy activities to support Timmy’s local and international programs.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I remain committed to my pursuit of a future career in international public health. I hope that one day, I will have the opportunity to return to Guatemala—to learn more about how the mobile clinics operate throughout the country, how the community health workers impact patients’ lives, and what healthcare services are like when medical teams are not present.</p>
<p>For now, however, I am deeply grateful to Timmy Global Health and the Hank Benjamin Memorial Scholarship for allowing me to share in this experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ChristianyKatharina.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Christian and Katharina"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5514" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Christian and Katharina" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ChristianyKatharina-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Before deciding to join Timmy Global Health as medical professionals, both of us had been working for some years as medical assistants at one of Europe&#8217;s biggest university teaching hospitals—<em>Charité – Universitaetsmedizin Berlin</em>. We were used to working with highly specialized diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Talking to each other, both of us realized that we have shared a growing interest in humanitarian work and an urge to help underserved people ever since we had been in med school. Conscious of the contrast to high-tech university medicine we wanted to go back to basic medical examination and primary care. Unfortunately, it was not easy to find a placement in a humanitarian project for both of us because we wanted to work together as a couple and share the experience. After a lot of research, we were grateful to finally connect with Timmy Global Health—who offered us the opportunity to work and volunteer together. In the spring of 2012 we had applied as long-term volunteers at Timmy´s medical site in the <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/archidona-ecuador/" target="_blank">Amazon Basin of Ecuador</a>. Working closely with Timmy’s medical team coordinator in Tena, August Longino, we started our humanitarian mission that autumn.</p>
<p>We were transported directly from Germany´s capital and melting pot, Berlin, to the heart of the Ecuadorian jungle—<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/archidona-ecuador/" target="_blank">Tena</a>, situated in the Oriente province. At first, both of us struggled with the jungle´s humidity, the different kinds of huge insects and, of course, with the situation of the patients we encountered in the region. We quickly realized the harsh contrast to Germany´s western-style medicine. Certainly, both of us had expected a lack of hygiene, of diagnostic and therapeutic aid, but in the end, we had to admit that the patients in Oriente were far worse off than we thought they would be. <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Katharina.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Katharina"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5515" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Katharina" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Katharina-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Working with Antony Hidalgo, the Director of the Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra Public Regional Hospital, we started our humanitarian project by accompanying the local Ecuadorian doctors on their everyday internal medicine ward rounds. After getting more comfortable with our Spanish, we got to know the most frequent diseases of the region—which included a large number of gastro-intestinal infections, pneumonia, malnutrition, and other diseases frequent in developing countries (tuberculosis, dengue-fever, snake bites, and self-induced intoxication with barbasco and organophosphates).<strong> </strong>Learning about how to diagnose and treat these different diseases was challenging, but the hardest part of our work at the public hospital was encountering a completely foreign patient mentality.</p>
<p>We had to learn to respect their ancient beliefs in the power of the Shamans—which were and are still the natural healers of the communities. And we had to accept their fear of western medicine and their overall preoccupation of not having enough money to pay for the treatments we recommended. This was especially difficult, as many of the inhabitants of the poorer communities in the Oriente could not afford the costs of expensive hospital stays and treatments with their daily incomes of about one US dollar.  In many cases, if patients had to see specialists, they usually had to travel at least five hours to Quito. For the majority of them, this was nowhere near an affordable option. Combined with their cultural backgrounds, anxiety to enter a big city like Ecuador´s capital, and lack of access to the expensive medications recommended for treating urological and neurological problems, providing care to these patients was sometimes just impossible.</p>
<p><a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Christian.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Christian"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5516" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 5px;" title="Christian" src="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Christian-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>In the afternoons both of us established our neurological and urological consultations in the private Stadler Richter Hospital—in the nearby small town of Archidona. There was a high medical demand for consults, especially in neurological treatment for diseases like Parkinson´s and epilepsy. Facing the fate of chronically ill patients, like the many neurological patients we saw through our consults, we felt miserable to learn that coverage for their daily medication does not yet exist within the Ecuadorian health system. We were so grateful to learn that Timmy Global Health organized and financed the treatment of our patients suffering from Parkinson´s disease and epilepsy.</p>
<p>During one of our first weeks in the Amazon Basin, a Timmy Global Health supported hernia repair team came to serve the community (<a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/2012/12/12/the-logistics-of-surgery-health-care-timmys-1st-surgical-trip/" target="_blank">Read more about this trip in a post by Andrew Morrow</a>). Within a week´s time five surgeons operated on more than 60 patients suffering from different kinds of hernias (inguinal, umbilical and scrotal). Christian enjoyed working with the American and Italian surgeons and was thrilled to be able to improve his surgical knowledge. In the meanwhile he was eager doing ward rounds on the common surgical ward of Tena´s public hospital, too, where he got to know its chief surgeon Dr. Llamuca. He could assist in the operating room, especially when it came to urological questions like prostate-excision etc. and tried to help out wherever a hand was needed.</p>
<p>In December and January we joined Timmy’s primary care medical teams that came to the region to provide healthcare to the very remote communities of the Oriente, some of which could only be reached by foot or travelling by boat along the Rio Napo. We really enjoyed these mobile clinic days, visiting every day another community, working together with other Timmy doctors, and teaching and supporting the Timmy student volunteers (which were not all pre-med students, though showed eager interest in public health). They did a great job and showed respect to the patients. I was able to treat approximately 30 to 40 patients a day, sometimes the whole family with a bunch of 7-8 children. The patients presented with a broad spectrum of diseases from common flu symptoms to severe pneumonia, malnutrition of the children due to parasites, skin infections like fungus or impetigo, and also severe cases of epilepsy, Parkinson´s disease, birth abnormalities or genitourinary malformation. Thanks to the service provided by Timmy Global Health, complicated cases like these could be referred to <a href="http://timmyglobalhealth.org/index.php/what-we-do/international-outreach/quito-ecuador/" target="_blank">specialized hospitals in Quito</a>.</p>
<p>Looking back at our time in the Amazon Basin, I can say it was a truly unique experience that we had. Working with Timmy Global Health consisted of so many different kinds of work: ward rounds, operating rooms, mobile medical clinics…but above all getting to know the people of Ecuador. We enjoyed getting in touch with the indigenous populations living in their small, remote communities surrounded by wilderness, and supplying them with urgently needed healthcare options. We both can finally say that this kind of humanitarian work was not only a donation to the Ecuadorian people; but it was also a great benefit for us! Thank you!</p>
