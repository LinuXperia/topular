<p>But have you heard the term crowdfunding? If not, don’t worry. I just heard it too. Although, strangely, I knew the definition already. From Wiki:</p>
<p>Crowdfunding (alternately crowd financing, equity crowdfunding, crowd-sourced fundraising) is the collective effort of individuals who network and pool their money, usually via the Internet, to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations Crowdfunding is used in support of a wide variety of activities, including disaster relief, citizen journalism, support of artists by fans, political campaigns, startup company funding, motion picture promotion, free software development, inventions development, scientific research, and civic projects. According to Wordspy, the earliest use of the word &#8220;crowdfunding&#8221; was by Michael Sullivan in fundavlog in August 2006.</p>
<p>See? You knew what it was. The nomenclature threw you. Essentially, people fund a project. And more importantly, their reason for funding a particular project revolves around their passions, hobbies, community or art. A group of people come together and independently, but somehow collectively and financially support something they believe in. It’s the power of the people. How poetic is that, y’all?</p>
<p>This process has been around forever. Remember when your neighbors all pitched in to help with Susie’s leg operation? I made that up, but I’m sure you’ve contributed to something similar back in the day. Nowadays, with the interwebs, you fund projects and initiatives all around the globe with a click of the mouse.</p>
<p>Are you interested in raising funds for a cause or organization? Check out these sites for inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Kickstarter. </b>Kickstarter is a crowdfunding site that helps organizations, artists and more with fulfill their creative projects through the direct support of individual financial backers. “People cannot invest in Kickstarter projects to make money. They can only back projects in exchange for a tangible reward or one-of-a-kind experience, like a personal note of thanks, custom T-shirts, dinner with an author, or initial production run of a new product. Project creators choose a deadline and a minimum funding goal. If the goal is not met by the deadline, no funds are collected.”  My fiancé Mark is really into this model and just pledged a chunk of change towards a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/409030043/warmachine-tactics">RPG project for Warmachine</a>. Their goal was $550,000. They are currently at $1.3 million dollars. I think there may be a lot of gamers out there. <a href="http://tradeschool.coop/indianapolis" target="_blank">Trade School Indy</a> (my pride &amp; joy) also just <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tradeschoolindy/trade-school-indy-classroom-community-space">launched a campaign on Kickstarter</a> for a community space and we’ve got less than a month to go!<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Team in Training – Leukemia Lymphoma Society. </b>You can run your first (or second, third or 20<sup>th</sup>!) race while doing good! Crowdfunding geniuses <a href="http://www.teamintraining.org/in/">Team in Training of Indiana</a>  bring people together to train for races around the country, all the while fund raising to fight blood cancers. I’ve run and raised money for different organizations, but TnT Indy has been the most supportive, friendly group ever. Ever.</p>
<p><b>Concept Catapult. </b>Trade School instructor/friend and Irvington resident Vishant Shah recently told us about <a href="http://www.conceptcatapult.com/703-2">Concept Catapult</a>, a crowdfunding site where the backers, in a sense, <i>are</i> the project owners too. Say you’d like to see a Vegan restaurant on X corner in Y neighborhood. You post your idea on Concept Catapult, the community spreads the word and eventually business owners and entrepreneurs take notice. Once linked to a variety of businesses that could make the Vegan restaurant a reality, the community votes for their favorite and the funds raised are released.</p>
<p><b>Indiegogo. </b>Our pal Melissa is awesome. She is crafty and cool and crafty all over again. She decided to take her skills to the next level and do something for the kiddos. She’s launched a project on Indiegogo called, “<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/100-quilts-100-kids?utm_campaign=Buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer38143&amp;utm_medium=twitter">100 Quilts for 100 Kids</a>,” a truly heart-warming (get it?) effort to get homemade quilts to children who need it most. Even if Melissa doesn’t meet her goal, she’s still going to make 100 quilts! That’s our good-go-getter. Indiegogo is super similar to Kickstarter, though their project fees differ a bit.</p>
<p>With all of these sites and resources to get your project off the ground, the most inspiring part to me is the people part of it all. It’s not backed by some mega corporation (though, if you want to back Trade School, Mickey D’s, be my guest&#8230;we&#8217;re lovin&#8217; it) – it’s backed by friends and family and neighbors. The people who you co-exist with on a daily basis that care about the same things you do. OR some dude across two continents that has similar interests as you and wants to see a project through. Shrinking world. Mind blown.</p>
<p>People are inherently good, creative and skilled at getting things done. It’s thrilling to write that.</p>

<p>As an admitted environmentalist, I devote my best efforts to recycling as much as I can.  However, curbside recycling is not currently offered where I live.  So, I am therefore forced to collect my recyclables in a bin in my kitchen, and then lug them to the nearest recycling facility.  Despite my best intentions, I continue to watch my recyclables pile up in their blue plastic bin of shame week after week, and often, in an attempt to save time, end up just tossing these items into the trash.</p>
<p>Tired of seeing my recyclables end up in plastic landfill-destined <a href="http://indyhub.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photo-21.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2225" alt="photo 2(1)" src="http://indyhub.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photo-21-300x300.jpg" width="270" height="270" /></a>garbage bags week after week, I decided to better educate myself about recycling options in Indianapolis.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover many community organizations and city programs dedicated to easing the process of recycling.</p>
<p>My search began with the <a href="http://www.indianarecycling.org" target="_blank">Indiana Recycling Coalition</a>, who promotes recycling statewide. The IRC has created the “<a href="http://www.indianarecycles.org" target="_blank">EcoVille</a>” website, which provides information about types of recyclable materials such as <a href="http://indianarecycles.org/residential-recycling-programs/residential-recycling-programs-used-oil/" target="_blank">used oil</a>, <a href="http://indianarecycles.org/residential-recycling-programs/residential-recycling-programs-Composting-Yard-Trimmings/" target="_blank">compost and yard trimmings</a>, and even those pesky<a href="http://indianarecycles.org/residential-recycling-programs/residential-recycling-programs-compact-fluorescent-bulbs/" target="_blank"> CFL bulbs</a>.  A statewide <a href="http://indianarecycles.org/ecopoint" target="_blank">map</a> of recycling drop-off locations is also provided.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kibi.org" target="_blank">Keep Indianapolis Beautiful</a> maintains the City&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kibi.org/recycle_and_reuse_guide" target="_blank">Recycling and Reuse Guide</a>, which informs residents of local companies and organizations who accept materials for recycling or reuse. They also provide information on where to recycle<a href="http://www.kibi.org/recycle_junk_mail_paper_telephone_books" target="_blank"> junk mail and other paper products</a>, and list upcoming <a href="http://www.kibi.org/recycle_household_waste_toxdrop_and_sustain_indy" target="_blank">ToxDrop</a> events where citizen’s may dispose of household hazardous waste.</p>
<p>The City of Indianapolis has an official &#8220;recycling philosophy&#8221;, which, you guessed it, includes a mission to reduce, reuse, and recycle.  The City’s site lists City designated <a href="http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPW/SustainIndy/RRR/Recycle/Pages/Drop-offLocations.aspx">drop-off locations</a> in the Metropolitan Area, and offers information on the <a href="http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPW/SustainIndy/RRR/Recycle/Pages/CurbsideRecycling.aspx">curbside recycling program</a>,which Indianapolis residents may opt-in to (for a $6 monthly fee). The City is working to expand it’s <a href="http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPW/SustainIndy/RRR/Recycle/Pages/PedestrianRecycling.aspx">pedestrian recycling program</a>, installing recycling bins along popular city streets.  Several recycling bins are already installed around central downtown, along Mass Ave, and in Broad Ripple, so be sure to keep your eye out, and drop your bottles and cans in these designated receptacles when  you are in the area!</p>
<p>If this post now has you jazzed up about recycling, then you’re in luck, as <a href="http://www.indianalivinggreen.com" target="_blank">Indiana Living Green</a> will be hosting <a href="http://do317.com/event/2013/07/27/recycle-fest-garfield-park-indianapolis-indy-parks-summer-concert-series">Recycle Fest,</a> next Saturday, July 27 at Garfield Park.  Recycle Fest will combine environmentally responsible initiatives through an all day festival featuring live music, demonstrations, activities and education.  I hope you will take this opportunity to not only enjoy the food and music, but to also learn more about recycling in Indianapolis!</p>
<p>Reducing, reusing, and recycling are important to conserving energy and preserving precious natural resources in our city, state, and nation.  What have you found to be the most efficient ways to recycle in Indianapolis?  What advice do you have for fellow recyclers? How can we work to improve the ease and efficiency of recycling in our City?</p>

<p>It’s all so exciting! We are extremely happy and can’t wait to plan our day. Mark is my best friend and we’re about to take BFF to a whole ‘nother level.</p>
<p>Some things I’ve noticed since getting engaged:</p>
<ul>
<li>After telling the engagement story, the follow up question is always, “So, have you set a date?” And then I stress out. It’s been less than two weeks? Should I have done that already?</li>
<li>My mother is crazier than I previously thought. She just got a texting plan three weeks ago. That first week before we got engaged: bible verses. Now: deep wedding thoughts by Leisa Huntley. “Blaire, we need a photo for the Charlotte Observer, STAT.” …”Blaire, thought of a good idea for your colors. Call me (insert emoticon I&#8217;ve never seen before)” … “Blaire Louise, I will not be ignored!”</li>
<li>Weddings are more expensive than I previously thought. Holy cow.</li>
<li>There’s lots to do, but all I keep coming back to is the food and booze. Is that weird?</li>
<li>I want the venue that matches us. Like, I want folks to say, “Wow, this place is so Mark and Blaire!” And only buy things on our registry.</li>
<li>I have no idea what sort of bride I am.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the magazines say, are you a city bride? A downhome bride? A traditional bride? Are you into rustic looks or classic looks? Do you envision a table full of glitter and Gatsby influences? Or do you see Mason jars and burlap? Tell us what your soul looks like!</p>
<p>Dude. I have no idea. And with <a href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> and <a href="http://www.marthastewartweddings.com/" target="_blank">Martha</a> and <a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com/" target="_blank">Style Me Pretty</a> and <a href="http://greenweddingshoes.com/category/diy-ideas/" target="_blank">Green Wedding Shoes</a> and <a href="http://theknot.com/" target="_blank">the Knot</a> and so many DIY bloggers telling you how you can save cash by being crafty, my brain hurts. The interwebs are oversaturated with ideas and tips and lists for your perfect vision and…I can’t.</p>
<p>I have a “vision,” if you will, but includes a whole bunch of crap now. Do I want that? Or am I “seeing” that because it’s in my face? I feel like 2,343 pinners have hijacked my brain with gold table runners and peonies and open dancing playlists. Can you play 2Live Crew in front of your aunt? I mean, I’m thinking not, but it is our day!</p>
<p>Of course, these are first-world problems and I am obviously so fortunate to have so many friends to advise me and so many resources to choose from. It’s just knowing where to start I think. I’m drawing inspiration from lots of places and I need to calm the heck down.</p>
<p>What are you tips for getting started? Any words of wisdom or regrets? Did you use a planner? How did you stay under budget (still figuring out what the budget is)? Should we just go down to <a href="http://www.indy.gov/eGov/County/Clerk/Marriage/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx" target="_blank">Indianapolis City Hall</a>? Help.</p>
<p>For now, I’m going to straight chill and look at this sparkly thing for a little while longer. That’s the type of bride I am. One that is easily distracted.</p>
<p>Oh and if you have any tips for music, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahvf10V9KqgtdFlBNVdiN1dGX2ZFSHBQWk1ySmh6YlE&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">put ‘em here</a>. I <em>do know</em> that our DJ will take requests!</p>

I thought that concept was fairly laughable. I had zero experience and more importantly zero skills at fixing up things around the house. I felt confident that I could paint the house and if a light bulb went out, I could change that also. Beyond that&#8230;the only possible solution was to call in a professional.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074" alt="2850049395_41a5f31457_z" src="http://indyhub.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2850049395_41a5f31457_z.jpg" width="640" height="319" />That all changed when a friend bought me TIVO as a wedding gift. It was back before all the wireless technology was common in a home and it needed a phone connection. I promptly went out to the closest Big Box hardware store told them about my situation. They explained to me how to create a new phone port in my home for the TIVO. The project was an absolute disaster&#8230;what should have taken an hour resulted in 2 days worth of work, 2 days without phone service (based on some not so good advice at the big box which had me cut my main phone line), a hole in my ceiling, and 2 days of intense frustration in the heat of my attic&#8230;but I was hooked but scarred.  I swore I would never shop at that first store again and there would be no more projects. Only one of those two items stuck&#8230;I have not shopped at that store again!</p>
<p>Slowly I started taking on more and more complex projects up to the point where I ripped the vanity out of my bath room, cut the pipes and installed a new one vanity. That was by far the scariest and most exciting challenge I took on. Over the years I have done a lot of complicated things like this, but their success was all due to two things: 1) An amazingly patient wife, and 2) The expert advice of a local hardware store.</p>
<p>There are lots of great local hardware stores in our city. Just drive up Keystone and you will come to two of them. There is Hedlund Hardware at 62nd &amp; Keystone and Sullivan&#8217;s Hardware at 69th &amp; Keystone. My home base is the Fishers Do-It-Center just north of 116th &amp; Allisonville Road. I don&#8217;t think most people consider these smaller stores as their first option because they think&#8230;.I need to go to the big box store where they already have everything waiting for me. The smaller places typically have just as big of a selection, you just may need to order it as opposed to being able to take it home that day. What I find to be absolutely superior at the local hardware stores is the customer service and deep knowledge of the projects. In Fishers, when I walk in I am greeted by name (as is my dog Blake, it is his favorite store also). It doesn&#8217;t matter who I am dealing with, they will patiently walk me through everything I need to know about installing pegboard or fixing a leak in a toilet. I have never left with bad advice. I have also never left with advice I didn&#8217;t understand. They draw me pictures, show me examples and will make sure that I know what I am doing before I leave.</p>
<p>My mom told me when I moved to a new city I needed to find a car mechanic and a dry cleaner. When I talk to people I tell them they need to find a local hardware store to help them through all the surprises they will encounter with their homes.</p>

If you know IndyHub, you know that we love connecting people with each other, with other organizations, and with Indianapolis as whole. This Friday, June 28, we&#8217;re hosting the next 5&#215;5 event, <a title="Face Your City: An Urban Love Affair" href="http://indyhub5x5faceyourcity.eventbrite.com/"><b>Face Your City: An Urban Love Affair</b></a>.<i> What is 5&#215;5? </i>Well, if you&#8217;re super clued-into Indy&#8217;s arts scene, you may already know the answer&#8230; but we&#8217;ll ask it anyways: What exactly is this 5&#215;5 thing? It&#8217;s a four-part series of arts-themed, Indy-bettering, idea pitching events (phew, that was a bit of a mouthful). But! There&#8217;s more: after opening up submissions for IndyHub&#8217;s Face Your City 5&#215;5, we spent weeks poring over batches of brilliant projects, working with our partner organizations to narrow it down to five finalists, and <b>on Friday, one of those ideas will receive $10,000 to make their project a reality.</b></p>
<p>So, who are these five finalists? And where can you follow along as they prep for the big day?</p>

<p>And where do you fit into this whole event?<b> Starting at 6 p.m.</b>, it&#8217;s going to be a city-celebration you won&#8217;t want to miss: from <b>a free block party on Georgia Street</b>with specially-prepared <b>food &amp; drinks available from the historic Omni Severin </b>(<em><strong>cash</strong> <strong>only</strong></em>: tacos, sliders, cotton candy and snow cones, mixed drinks, specialty drinks, beer &amp; wine) to tunes being spun by Indy favorite, <b><a title="DJ Helicon" href="http://twitter.com/WhatTheHelicon"><b>DJ Helicon</b></a> </b>(who also happens to be the brains behind the fabulous art &amp; music extravaganza, <a title="ORANJE" href="http://www.oranjeindy.com/">ORANJE</a>).

<p>And, to top it all off, you not only get to watch Indy&#8217;s future-in-the-making -<b> you are a participant: each attendee gets to vote</b>, casting their ballot for whichever project you believe best fits the &#8220;Face Your City&#8221; theme. <b><a title="Register here." href="http://indyhub5x5faceyourcity.eventbrite.com/">Register here.</a> </b></p>
<p>After the five finalists have presented (each allotted a maximum of five minutes, hence the alliterative moniker &#8220;5&#215;5&#8243;), our community partners will cast their vote, and the audience&#8217;s vote will be the tie-breaker. Thirty minutes after the fifth presenter finishes and all the ballots have been counted, the winner will be announced and presented with a check for $10,000. (Seriously, though, this ballot-counting won&#8217;t include any interminably long recounts, no &#8220;hanging chads&#8221;, no Supreme court cases.) And, as with every truly legendary party&#8230; there&#8217;s an after-party! Keep the night&#8217;s energy going with DJ Helicon at <a title="Social" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/social-indianapolis">Social</a>, just down the street from the event&#8217;s entrance.</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-7965b643-77a4-cdc5-b1f3-3b35b5c01484">I don’t swim. Actually, I can’t swim. I never learned. It’s not a big deal to me and it makes perfect sense: under the age of 10 I was around a pool maybe once a year on a random family trip that involved a Holiday Inn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because of it I don’t like boats much. I could care less about water sports. One of my worst nightmares involves being on a bridge that collapses into icy water Mothman Prophecies style (sorry if that’s a spoiler alert, but that movie came out 11 years ago so you have no excuse to get mad). A friend in middle school once asked me what I’d do if I was in a plane crash over the water and had to swim for survival. I told her I’d probably die of a heart attack long before swimming became an issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But despite this lack of interest to be physically on the water, I recently couldn’t escape the fact that I miss it. Or living near it, rather.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I was 10 and my family moved to the northern tip of Gulfport, Mississippi, we were a 5-10 drive to the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico. It was normal to look at the water when I took a trip to the library, to go shopping for new back to school clothing, to eat dinner out on a Saturday night. Parking lots were sprinkled with seagulls. Halloween day could be spent at the beach. When we moved over to Louisiana we grew accustomed to watching the freighters go by on the Mississippi River. Then Katrina happened&#8211;another water-related nightmare&#8211;and we headed back home again to Indiana.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The series of moves during my childhood had presented an instability of sorts. It was always an adventure and I look back on everything fondly as we so often do of our experiences growing up. But the lack of an official home, a childhood structure to return to or a city that I can nod toward and call my hometown, gives me a unique situation. I wanted to feel settled, to establish roots, and with the Indy area being the only place that’s ever really felt like home, I knew I wanted to settle here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t been thinking about leaving Indy these past few months. It wasn&#8217;t something I planned. It was just a feeling that appeared, a sense that there&#8217;s so much out there I need to do and see.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not that Indy has failed me on any level, that it hasn’t provided me creative, professional and social nourishment, that I haven’t met people who are interesting, friendly, and inspiring. This city is exceptional and so is the community I&#8217;ve been slowly building. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been feeling so darn guilty about it. Instead it&#8217;s a deep rooted characteristic I didn’t quite know I possessed. It’s the one that has me looking at pictures of Charleston, of swooning at bloggers&#8217; pictures of their walk down their streets in Arlington, of looking up towns I hear about on TV or see mentioned in a magazine article. It&#8217;s the one that has me thinking a lot about the relaxing lull of the water on the shore and the gentle salty breezes that tickle your senses, especially on days like today where my focus is little. It’s the same one my parents possess that led them to move almost 1000 miles away from their home state for the first time as they approached 50 (okay, that partly involved a desire to never use a snow shovel again). It&#8217;s a need for adventure, a sense of feeling somewhat claustrophobic.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just a simple, curable wanderlust. Maybe it can be solved with a burst of travel and exploration, something I’ve been slim on lately. When I’ve been away, whether Nashville for a semester or Athens, Georgia, for a summer, I’ve always found myself counting down until the time I could return home. But I can&#8217;t say for sure. <a href="http://indyhub.org/the-roaring-twenties-why-i-stayed-in-indy/">I once wrote</a> that I knew life was crazy enough I couldn’t say I’d live here forever, and maybe I won&#8217;t after all. Or maybe I will. For now all I can say is that when I drive through the countryside on my way home from events in the city, as I watch the summer sun beginning to set, casting a golden glow on the farms and trees that have seen decades of our history, I never feel more at home.</p>

<p>1.  Early this week, IndyGo introduced a new <a href="http://www.indygo.net/pages/june-2013-service-changes">cross-town route</a> on 86<sup>th</sup> street.  The new route will help to connect areas between Trader’s Point on the Northwest Side, and Community Hospital North on the Northeast side.</p>

<p>2. Indianapolis has stepped into the national spotlight, as Mayor Ballard announced this week the selection of Indy as the first US location to implement a new <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20130610/NEWS05/306100049/French-run-car-sharing-service-will-raise-Indy-s-profile-business-leaders-say">electric car-sharing program</a> from Paris-based Bollere .  The fleet will include approximately 500 electric cars, and 1,200 charging stations.  Point-to-point rentals could last anywhere from 15 minutes to an entire day. This service, which will help to improve the city’s connectivity, is expected to begin in 2014.</p>
<p>3.  The Indianapolis Board of Public Works approved a proposal for a new <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20130612/NEWS05/306120074/Indianapolis-board-approves-contract-launch-bike-sharing-service-Cultural-Trail">bike-sharing service</a> on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail.  The plan calls for 300 bikes and 24 rental stations to be placed along or near the trail.  Residents and visitors will be able to rent bicycles for short trips around downtown for a small fee. This bike sharing will to improve mobility and accessibility of the City, decreasing dependence on cars, and increasing physical activity.  Service will begin in May 2014.</p>
<p>Announcements such as these show Indy’s dedication to provide expanded transportation options for residents and visitors, making Indianapolis more accessible and a more attractive place to work, live, and play, while also helping to reducing car emissions and improve air quality.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait until next fall for new bike and car sharing services to become available?

<p>Before I moved to Indy, I think I was less interested in whether a team was winning or losing; I rooted for the teams in the city that I was currently living in. And I was faithful…until I moved. Another day, another LIDS hat. So, I’m coining a term I’d like to call, “Location-Based Fan.” Or LBF.</p>
<p>Sure. Hate on me, dudes. I know it&#8217;s wrong. But it&#8217;s really hard to root for a team when you’re long gone and so far away! You feel disconnected from other fans. No one else around you is wearing your team colors or knows your corny cheers. And everyone talks smack about your players!</p>
<p>Here are some anecdotes from my forthcoming (fake) novel called, A <i>Tale of Four Cities: A Girl and Her Many Teams</i>:</p>
<p>Chapter one:  I played tee ball when I was younger before soccer became my main sport. When my crush Sean joined a rival tee ball team, I panicked – how will he know I love him if my loyalties lay with another team? Consequently, I totally lost a game for us by &#8216;forgetting&#8217; to run home from third base because I was chatting up the third baseman, Sean the hot six-year-old. A case of LBF? Not really, but definitely a desperate woman.</p>
<p>Chapter two: College? That doesn&#8217;t count because I went to the best school in the country (nay, world) and have just as much or more love for my Tar Heels than I do for Mark and pulled pork. In this instance, I&#8217;m not a LBF, because I bleed blue for Carolina. College sports are different. There is a deeper loyalty that comes with your alma mater’s athletics programs. So deep that when I see someone wearing a Duke shirt, I automatically roll my eyes. It’s intrinsic. I can’t help it. Make sense? I thought no.</p>
<p>Chapter three:  Cities. I have lived in Youngstown, Charlotte, Chapel Hill, New York and now Indianapolis. I have &#8220;loved&#8221; the Browns, the Panthers, the Hornets, the Knicks, the Mets, the Giants and the Yankees. But these weren&#8217;t fulfilling relationships. They were the LBF kind. I rarely learned players’ names (save for Alex Rodriguez – can&#8217;t forget <em>his</em> name, wowza) and could really care less about the upcoming seasons, though I pretended like I did. These moments of lust weren&#8217;t like my relationship with the Tar Heels. I didn&#8217;t go home from games Googling stats or get in arguments online about a botched play. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cT_Ulmcrys" target="_blank">I didn&#8217;t make time for that</a>.</p>
<p>But then Indy happened. I moved here and I settled, but not like Mindy’s settling for Ders (she should be with <a href="http://themindyproject.wikia.com/wiki/Danny_Castellano" target="_blank">Danny</a>, come on), but settle in the, “let’s get comfortable” way.  I like the Pacers. And I like the Colts. And the Indians. I’m learning to love them. And not because the Pacers are doing well, and not because I simply live here, but because they are so awesome to watch. Watching them play and defeat other amazing teams on the court is awesome. Watching George Hill is awesome and beats Rodriguez any day, girl. Watching them dedicate their time to the community I now call my home is even more awesome. I think when you start to put real roots down as an adult, you want firmer ties with the people and leaders in your community. Maybe that stuff didn&#8217;t matter to me when I was in other cities? Not sure. But it does now.</p>
<p>I know this thing with the Pacers seems sudden, but we’re taking it slow. We’re in the hand-holding stage now, you know? But I have a good feeling about this one. And whether or not they beat the Heat, we’ll stay together.</p>
