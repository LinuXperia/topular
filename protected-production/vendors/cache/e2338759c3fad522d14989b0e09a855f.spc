<p>The city chose Flaherty &amp; Collins Properties to develop the new site that will feature 300 luxury apartments, 500 parking spaces and 43,000 square feet of ground floor retails.</p>
<p><a href="http://tribwxin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/market-sq-development-2.jpg"><img src="http://tribwxin.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/market-sq-development-2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=166" alt="market sq development 2" width="300" height="166" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-62708" /></a>“This project will alter the way people view downtown Indy living,” said Mayor Ballard. “Flaherty &amp; Collins has a great track record of success in our city, its design was the unanimous selection of my advisory team, and they are very close to finalizing a tenant for the retail space. This project will be a great addition to downtown Indy.”</p>
<p>The developers’ proposal includes green space and pool on the parking/retail roof, a green sky window on the tower roof, and apartments with panoramic views of Indianapolis through floor-to-ceiling windows and balconies. The project will offer one- and two-bedroom apartments with rents anticipated to range from $1,300-$2,400 per month.</p>
<p>“We have been pursuing the development of the Market Square parcel since our first proposal to the City in 1999,” said David Flaherty, CEO of Flaherty &amp; Collins Properties. “We thought it was a great site then and believe it to be an even better opportunity today. This iconic cutting-edge-designed tower will change the downtown skyline and make a bold statement about Indianapolis being a progressive, forward thinking city.”</p>
<p>The city will contribute $17.8 million to the $81 million project by investing property taxes generated from the project back into the development. Pending approval by the Metropolitan Development Commission and City-County Council, construction is expected to start next spring and be completed in late 2015.</p>
<p>Six companies initially submitted proposals to develop the site after the mayor announced his intentions to redevelop the area. Flaherty &amp; Collins Properties was chosen by a panel of government, real estate and community leaders.</p>

<p>Detectives with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department are investigating the death of a woman who was found in a south side home.</p>
<p>Officers responded to a house in the 1800 block of Singleton Road at approximately 10:30 p.m. Monday.  When they arrived, they found 24-year-old Shanna Elmore dead.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend, Cory Musick, has been taken into custody in connection with the death. Police said there has been a history of police calls to the house, most recently last Friday.  The couple has also been listed in several police reports and have both been arrested on domestic battery charges.</p>
<p>According to a 2011 police report, when Elmore was five months pregnant, Musick accused of standing over her and punching her in the stomach, &#8220;causing pain and gravely endangering her unborn child&#8221;.</p>
<p>Neighbors told Fox 59 News that Musick has been acting strange for a few days.  They said he seemed nervous and would not let anyone into his house.</p>
<p>The couple had two children together.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, police from several agencies arrived at an east side home in the Village Quarter neighborhood. They were looking for Anthony Joseph Garcia—a former medical resident at Creighton University suspected in the slayings of four people, including a double homicide in 2008 and a pair of killings this year.</p>
<p>According to Indiana State Police, Garcia had worked at one time in the U.S. federal prison in Terre Haute and bought the Village Quarter home on Greywing Court last year. He wasn’t home; police said officers in Illinois had picked him up on suspicion of drunk driving. Police said Garcia was licensed to practice medicine in Illinois.</p>
<p>Detectives from the Omaha Police Homicide Unit searched the home alongside Indiana State Police detectives and agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>Police said Garcia served as a doctoral resident at Creighton University. In 2001, he was fired by Dr. Roger Brumback and William Hunter. According to Omaha police, officials cited erratic and insubordinate behavior in his firing.</p>
<p>He left Nebraska after being terminated, but police said he returned in 2008, showing up at Hunter’s home and killing his son, 11-year-old Thomas Hunter, and 57-year-old Shirlee Sherman. Police said they were not his intended targets.</p>
<p>In May, Roger and Mary Brumback, both 65 years old, were found dead in their Omaha home. Roger Brumback was the chairman of the Creighton University department of pathology where Garcia had worked.</p>
<p>Police believe all four slayings were revenge killings connected to Garcia’s firing. Because of the amount of time between Garcia&#8217;s termination and the 2008 deaths of Thomas Hunter and Shirlee Sherman, police said they didn&#8217;t originally connect him to the slayings.</p>

<p>CNN has tried to answer every question you didn&#8217;t even know you had about this kid who&#8217;s famous before his or her first picture has been snapped.</p>
<p>It seems like forever that Catherine Middleton has been pregnant, but the world first learned the news in December, when she was hospitalized with acute morning sickness.</p>
<p>Since then, her every mommy-to-be move and maternity outfit has been scrutinized.</p>
<p>The baby is expected to debut at St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital in London.</p>
<p>Will you be the first to know? Well, you&#8217;ll definitely know as soon as an official public announcement is made, but Grandma and some other VIPs get dibs. Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations will be told, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families.</p>
<p>An announcement will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace, royal sources have told CNN.</p>
<p>There, the notice will be placed on an easel on the palace forecourt, the sources say. This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>After it goes onto the easel, a press notice will be dispatched, and it&#8217;s expected &#8212; but not confirmed &#8212; that Twitter will carry the news.</p>
<p>Speaking of the grand gender reveal, if you placed bets on pink, you might win that office pool. Supposedly, the Duchess let it slip in June that she might be having a daughter when she bought a teddy bear. That tidbit led to a media frenzy and a royal source telling CNN that the couple didn&#8217;t know the sex.</p>
<p>Again, your money is probably good if you&#8217;re predicting frilly smocks and hair bows. Scientists say the baby is slightly more likely to be a girl.</p>
<p>Bookies have been taking bets for names. Alexandra is one of the most predicted ones.</p>
<p>Besides being adorable, the girl could one day have a fantastic career. She could be queen.</p>
<p>Until 2011, any daughter born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would not have enjoyed an equal right to inherit the British throne. Rules dating back centuries decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was only bestowed on a daughter when there were no sons. But the rules of succession were changed.</p>
<p>The child will be next in line to the British throne after William, whose father, Charles, is first in line.</p>
<p>But first, the child will be &#8230; well, a child. And Margaret Rhodes, a cousin and lifelong friend of the queen, said Elizabeth&#8217;s parents &#8212; King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother &#8212; tried to keep their daughter&#8217;s childhood &#8220;sacrosanct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just a time for learning and enjoying. And I think that they succeeded,&#8221; Rhodes said. As for the expected royal arrival, she told CNN&#8217;s Christiane Amanpour, &#8220;I&#8217;m prepared to be excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine and hope that its early life, until it&#8217;s at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child&#8217;s life,&#8221; said Rhodes, who still periodically has &#8220;a nice little drink and a chat&#8221; with her old friend after church.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let&#8217;s get back to what really matters. Is this baby going to be ridiculously good-looking? Light hair like dad, dark hair like mom, ears like Prince Charles? This baby might win the day all around because its mother is the first commoner to marry into the royal family since the 17th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very good that they&#8217;re bringing in new genes,&#8221; Dr. Anand Saggar, a consultant in the South West Thames Regional Genetics Department at St. George&#8217;s Hospital Medical School in London, recently told CNN. &#8220;It freshens up the gene pool.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman, who was identified just as Juror B37, spoke exclusively to CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Anderson Cooper 360&#8243; on Monday night. She is the first juror to speak publicly about the case.</p>
<p>She said she believes Zimmerman&#8217;s &#8220;heart was in the right place&#8221; the night he shot Martin, but that he didn&#8217;t use &#8220;good judgment&#8221; in confronting the Florida teen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think George Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place, but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods, and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think his heart was in the right place. It just went terribly wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>If anything, Zimmerman was guilty of not using &#8220;good judgment,&#8221; the juror said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he was in the car, and he had called 911, he shouldn&#8217;t have gotten out of that car,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She also said she believes Martin threw the first punch in the confrontation that followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think George got in a little bit too deep, which he shouldn&#8217;t have been there. But Trayvon decided that he wasn&#8217;t going to let him scare him &#8230; and I think Trayvon got mad and attacked him,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Zimmerman felt his life was in danger before shooting Martin, and it was his voice that was heard screaming for help in 911 calls, the juror said she believes.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a right to defend himself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If he felt threatened that his life was going to be taken away from him, or he was going to have bodily harm, he had a right.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Split vote</strong></p>
<p>An initial vote was divided. Three of the jurors first voted Zimmerman was guilty, while three voted he was not guilty, she said. Juror B37 was among those who believed he was not guilty from the start.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a couple of them in there that wanted to find him guilty of something and after hours and hours and hours of deliberating over the law, and reading it over and over and over again, we decided there&#8217;s just no way, other place to go,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jurors were not identified by name during the trial, which sparked a broad debate about gun laws and race in America.</p>
<p>The juror said she did not believe Zimmerman profiled Martin, who was African-American, because of the color of his skin.</p>
<p>She believes he thought Martin was suspicious because of the way he acted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody would think anybody walking down the road, stopping and turning and looking &#8212; if that&#8217;s exactly what happened &#8212; is suspicious,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think all of us thought race did not play a role,&#8221; the juror said . &#8220;We never had that discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point during the interview, she grew emotional and her voice cracked. She said jurors cried after putting in their vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tragedy this happened. But it happened,&#8221; the juror said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think both were responsible for the situation they had gotten themselves into. I think both of them could have walked away. It just didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Book plans canceled </strong></p>
<p>The juror was planning to write a book about her experience with the case, literary agent Sharlene Martin said before her interview aired.</p>
<p>But hours later, the agent released a statement from Juror B37 saying she would no longer write one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury,&#8221; the juror said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realize it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered in order to protest our verdict from unfair outside influence, but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts of America’s new fitness standards for participating in the organization’s annual Jamboree are so rigorous they would not just exclude chubby tenderfoots — they would even bar many NFL players.</p>
<p>All Scouts were required to have a physical exam in advance of the Jamboree and those with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater were barred from participating at this year’s gathering, which features strenuous activities such as hiking, rock climbing, rappelling and biking. Scouts with BMIs between 32 and 39.9 had to provide additional health information to take on the 1,000-plus acre Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia. But critics told FoxNews.com excluding obese Boy Scouts goes against the spirit of the organization.</p>
<p>Patricia Bannon, a registered dietician and author of “Eat Right When Time Is Tight,” told FoxNews.com she found no issue with the guidelines, but said those who were excluded from the fitness competition should still be allowed to participate in some modified way.</p>
<p>“I’m sure they put a lot of thought into this and consulted with medical experts,” Bannon said. “But a BMI of 39.9 or higher is really high. The obesity rating for BMI is actually 30 or greater and in comparing them to NFL players, those NFL players are very likely to have very high muscle mass. And since BMI is a calculation of weight to height, it’s not a very good indicator for people who are athletes. These children with 39.9 or higher BMIs are probably not coming from a high muscle density.”</p>
<p>But severely overweight and obese Scouts should still be able to participate in some “altered” kind of competition if they are deemed unfit for the Jamboree, Bannon said.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately it still does exclude children due to their weight, but I’m sure they’re looking at their health and potential negative health consequences,” she said. “But maybe they could walk [the course] or do what they can and not be excluded. Anything that the Boy Scouts could do to compensate for the stigma of being excluded would be great.”</p>
<p>The Council on Size &amp; Weight Discrimination said it &#8220;deplores&#8221; the Boys Scouts decision, calling it  &#8221;an unfair and discriminatory policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are boy scouts who are heavier than average but extremely fit and capable of strenuous physical activity. At the same time, it is patently absurd to assume that just because a boy is thin, that means he is capable of a three-mile hike up a mountain,&#8221; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The average NFL player would qualify for the 10-day competition, but by no means would the entire league. The average BMI for an NFL player for the 2012 season was 31.35, according to SportingCharts.com, well above the normal range of 18.5-24.9 as set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At 45.64, Michael Jasper of the New York Giants had the highest BMI last season, the website reported. The league’s average nose tackle – with a BMI of 40.50 – would also be ineligible for the Boy Scout’s Jamboree.</p>
<p>Although anyone with a BMI above 25 would be classified as overweight and anyone above 30 would be considered obese, the figure is not a direct measure of body fatness.</p>
<p>“As a result, some individuals may have a high BMI but not have a high percentage of body fat,” according to the CDC’s website on BMI. “For example, highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness. Although some people with a BMI in the overweight range (from 25.0 to 29.9) may not have excess body fatness, most people with a BMI in the obese range (equal to or greater than 30) will have increased levels of body fatness.”</p>
<p>Still, CDC officials consider BMI to be a “fairly reliable” indicator of body fatness for most people and is derived by dividing weight in pounds by height in inches squared and multiplying by a factor of 703.</p>
<p>Overweight (25-29.9 BMI) and obese (30 and above) individuals, meanwhile, are at increased risk for many diseases and health conditions, including hypertensions, heart disease, stroke and type-2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Deron Smith, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America, told FoxNews.com in a statement that it&#8217;s unclear how many potential participants were impacted by the BMI requirement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching Scouts and Scouters how to live a sustainable life, which includes a healthy lifestyle, and the health of our participants are important goals of the jamboree,&#8221; Smith&#8217;s statement read. &#8220;We published our height-weight requirements years in advance and many individuals began a health regimen to lose weight and attend the jamboree.  But, for those who couldn’t, most self-selected and chose not to apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of the USA declined to comment on the BMI limit when contacted by FoxNews.com.</p>
<p>“This is in no way our policy,” the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Tanya Zuckerbrot, a New York-based dietitian, said youngsters with BMIs of40 or greater have a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke during the competition.</p>
<p>“And the BSA is obligated to care for these individuals,” Zuckerbrot said in a statement. “We don’t believe the BSA is equipped to adequately supervise a youth who is morbidly obese.”</p>
<p>Scouts who don’t meet that requirement, however, should be accommodated with physical activities and fitness education to help them adopt “new behaviors” and a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>The Jamboree was held every four years from 1981 to 2010 in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. In 2009, after reviewing more than 80 sites in 28 states, southern West Virginia was chosen as the Jamboree’s new location. More than 40,000 Scouts, volunteers and staffers are expected to join up to 50,000 visitors during the competition.</p>
<p>“The Boy Scouts were built on the outdoors, and the Summit is built on epic adventure,” Boy Scouts of America President Wayne Perry said in a statement released earlier this month. “Since the groundbreaking in 2010, a wonderful transformation has taken place at this Scouting venue in the beautiful hills of West Virginia, with more than 1,000 West Virginians helping with construction efforts.

<p>The Indiana Service Challenge is taking over Georgia Street. It’s courtesy of Companies With a Mission, whose goal is to change lives one charity at a time. This year, 200 businesses took the challenge to serve a charity, document their service and experience and then submitted it to a panel of judges. Soon, the organization will offer the challenge nationwide.</p>
<p>Last year, CWAM gave out $100,000 in the challenge. This year, $200,000 will go to the winning teams and more than 200 charities.</p>
<p>Mitch Davis, Executive Director of CWAM says “The money the charities get goes a long way,” said Mitch Davis, Executive Director of CWAM, “Sometimes, that will cover a year&#8217;s budget for a charity.”</p>
<p>It’s helping charities like U.S. Dream Academy</p>
<p>“It means everything. It helps us bring in volunteers, helps kids get to know different folks in the community and know that they care about them,” said Tina Lewellyn with U.S. Dream Academy.</p>
<p>Exact Target, OS, and Northview Church took home the top three prizes of $15,000 for their charities.  The rest of the $200,000 will be paid out to the other winning teams.</p>
<p>Companies With a Mission is also upping the challenge!  This is where you come in. The next challenge is the Super Service Challenge and it&#8217;s going nationwide this fall, so get your team together and enter to win.</p>
<p>CWAM will be giving out $1 million to the winning teams for their charities.  The top four teams will get to send two people to New York for a paid VIP Super Bowl experience.</p>

<p>One Central Indiana neighborhood is empowering itself to keep criminals out and motivate residents to be vigilant.</p>
<p>Carefree North and South is made up of nearly 700 homes and sits on the edge of County Line Road in Greenwood. Last year, a group of residents decided to create a neighborhood watch to protect each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not a patrol type organization. We&#8217;re just neighbors looking out for neighbors,&#8221; said Dan Taylor, who helped create the Carefree Crime Watch Program.</p>
<p>The group was moved to take action after the deadly explosion in the Richmond Hill neighborhood just three miles away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a good example of someone being vigilant enough to say, &#8216;Hey we saw this white van there,&#8217;&#8221; Taylor explained. &#8220;That really got us to thinking that, you know, we can make an impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, when a resident sees something suspicious, they call the assigned &#8220;Captain&#8221; of their district who then alerts everyone in the group through email and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CarefreeCrimeWatchProgram?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank">a Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Neighbors could even start getting text alerts on their phones soon.</p>
<p>They system came in handy this May when theives broke into a house in the middle of the afternoon and stole jewlry and coins from a family.</p>
<p>The Crime Watch believes that home was scoped out beforehand and informed the group to beware for solicitors.</p>
<p>The group will hold a public meeting at the Carefree Clubhouse this Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. to offer more information about the Crime Watch. It also invites other neighborhoods to attend and discuss their ideas for starting their own Crime Watch Programs.</p>

<p>It was a peace rally focused on the city’s most precious commodities. Children, from toddlers to teens, sat in the front and center, speaking out about violence.</p>
<p>Hundreds gathered at Veterans Memorial Plaza for The Stop the Violence Youth Rally Monday night. Youth leaders hope to reach out to children to curb violence after a deadly July. Five young men were killed in shootings this month.</p>
<p>“That’s what it boils down to – protecting your children,” said Aleanya Moore, an organizer from Ladies Under Construction. “Get off your bottom and help these kids. Stop complaining about what their parents aren’t doing. It takes a village.”</p>
<p>Organizers began planning the event after the July 4 shooting that killed 16-year-old Monquize Edwards. Eron Bonner, the teen accused of killing him, appeared in court Monday. Prosecutors are hoping to double the 18-year-old’s murder sentence with charges of criminal gang activity.</p>
<p>“It couldn’t come at a better time because it sends a message that violence is unacceptable,” said IMPD Chief Rick Hite. “I think people are sick and tired of being sick and tired.”</p>
<p>“Keep those kids in your mind, not just Trayvon Martin,” said Brandon Randall, an organizer from F.A.I.T.H Walk. “Despite their circumstances, despite any type of trouble they have been in, they were kids. They were in their prime of their life and not even that.”</p>
<p>Youth leaders say parents also need to make an effort to get kids off the streets by finding the right resources this summer.</p>
<p>“These are our kids who are dying every day and people need to realize that,” said Amie Whitaker, who attended the rally. “This is not going to stop until we step onto the plate and do something.”</p>
