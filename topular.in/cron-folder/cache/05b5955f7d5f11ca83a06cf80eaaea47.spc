Results during preseason aren't necessarily an indication that the good times will continue once the games start to count, but a young team looking to build confidence can use any boost they can get. A 4-0 win over NASL side Minnesota United FC isn't reason enough to believe that the roll will continue, but the win was expected and carried out showed that some of that youth can contribute.

Homegrown Player Joey Calistri scored a brace in the first half to give the Fire a 2-0 lead at half time. Calistri started preseason playing at right back and his ability to finish while in an attacking role is a good sign. Michael Harrington played an important part in both goals. His service into the box in the 24th was partially cleared away before the ball found its way to the foot of Calistri, who glanced a shot off the post and into the net. The second resulted from a good team buildup. Harrington's pass through the front of the goal mouth found Brandon Vincent running toward the end line. The rookie left back connected with his fellow first year pro for a clean side footed finish in the 35th and a 2-0 lead.

Kingsley Bryce looped a header into the net from a Rodrigo Ramos service for the third goal in the 60th minute, Alex Morrell was tripped in the penalty area in the 88th. Arturo Alvarez buried the spot kick to finish the scoring.

"Even though it's preseason, it's another opportunity for us to prepare how we want to play during the season, so we always have 100 percent the same attitude and preparation from the staff and the players. I'm very happy for the guys, I'm very happy that we're improving but there's still a lot to do and we have to increase the level in the next game and in the training sessions that we have coming up in preparation for March 6," said Veljko Paunovic at the conclusion of the match.

The Fire will close preseason on Saturday night against MLS Cup Champion, Portland Timbers.

The revolution continues! Veljko Paunovic and the Chicago Fire find themselves on a bit of a hot streak after defeating Vancouver in the first match of the Simple Invitational this past Sunday. It may just be preseason but the squad looks impressive and they have taken their coaches instructions and style of play to heart. They will continue their preparations for the regular season on Wednesday as they take on NASL side Minnesota United FC. Will their form and attacking prowess continue or will supporters see the first stumble of the Paunovic era?

Minnesota United Preseason Form Guide: 0-1

Previous Match: A 4-0 loss to Portland Timbers.

Formation: 4-3-3; Ndjock; Davis, Calvano, Pitchkolan, Venegas; Speas, Jordan, MIbson; Laing, Cruz, Ramirez

<b>Strengths:</b> Minnesota finished the 2015 NASL regular season in third place after a great fall campaign but were ousted from the cup semifinal in heartbreaking fashion. A late extra time Ottawa goal eliminated them. They’ve taken the offseason to restructure the squad and have brought in quite a few ex-MLS players to solidify the team. Danny Cruz, Ben Speas, and Bernardo Anor (loan) have made the move over to the Loons squad from Philly, Columbus, and KC respectively. None of their previous clubs had the most cordial relations with Chicago and this could add to the feistiness that will undoubtedly be present in the midfield. A change of scenery could see these players improve on what have been glimpses of offensive capability throughout their careers.

In total, Minnesota saw the departure of ten players for one reason or another and has seen the official arrival of seven new faces. While this could be construed as a negative in some senses, the Fire have shown how a shakeup can bring positives so we’ll slot the newness under the strengths column. Some of the players coming into the Minnesota squad have Loons fans pretty excited. Jamaican international Lance Laing was in the NASL Best XI last season with FC Edmonton and prides himself on his versatility in playing both left back and left wing. He has speed, good control on the ball and has been known to hit the back of the net from distance. Look for Laing to be a thorn in Brandon Vincent’s or Patrick Doody’s side on Wednesday.

Minnesota also secured the services of Kristian Nicht who played with Indy Eleven last season but had his start in the German Bundesliga with Nurnberg. His ability to command the back line as well as his prowess as a shot stopper might ensure that he wins the starting spot from Sammy Ndjock who had a terrible outing in the first match of the Invitational. His veteran presence could help stabilize what will likely be a haphazard defense on Wednesday.

The player likely to be the most dangerous man on the pitch for Minnesota is also a newcomer. The Loons wasted no time in acquiring last year’s NASL Golden Boot winner Stefano Pinho from Fort Lauderdale this offseason. His sixteen goals and seven assists in the regular season are impressive at any professional level. If Johan Kappelhof and Joao Meira play the way that they did against Vancouver, Sean Johnson might be a busy man on Wednesday. NASL or not, Pinho cannot be underestimated by a Chicago back four still trying to gain its bearings.

The Man Behind the Signings: The master mind behind those acquisitions was Minnesota native and the Loons first ever Sporting Director Manny Lagos. Lagos spent six years playing for the Minnesota Thunder in the USL before joining the Metro Stars when MLS came into existence. Lagos also played for the Fire in their inaugural ‘98 season before spending time with Tampa Bay, San Jose and Columbus. Saying that he knows the North American Soccer scene is a bit of an understatement. Minnesota is clearly looking to build for the future as they approach their transition to MLS. Lagos along with head coach Carl Craig and the squad will want to start what will surely be a conference rivalry off on the right foot.

<b>Weaknesses: </b>Yes it’s preseason and the Fire might be looking to rotate the squad in what is a highly congested week but if we’re going to be objective in our analysis then we have to speak frankly and say that this Minnesota side has a lot of issues to resolve coming into Wednesday’s match.

Bad Things Come in Twos: Minnesota’s last match spoke volumes as to their fitness, mentality, and skill level with the number two playing a prominent role in the proceedings. Two late and rash challenges by Tiago Calvano and Kevin Venegas led to red cards which had Minnesota down to ten men with about 30 minutes left to play. The Calvano challenge had no place in a regular season rivalry match much less a preseason friendly but was arguably the product of him being out worked and outpaced by Diego Valeri. It may have also been a product of growing frustration after Calvano had lazily given away an early penalty, but ultimately it came down to a lack of discipline. The Venegas challenge was also a bit reckless and in the box no less. It resulted in Portland’s second penalty of the evening, both of which were coolly converted.

The two goals wedged between the penalties were both products of a preseason lack of sharpness which resulted in Minnesota’s squad ball watching and pointing fingers. Fenando Adi crossed a ball in to a wide open Lucas Melano who tapped in his own rebound after a halfhearted swat away by Minnesota’s Ndjock for one, while Valeri and Darlington Nagbe played an intricate 1-2 around the Minnesota backline for the other. If the NASL season doesn’t work out for some of the guys they certainly have a future as practice dummies in Portland. Sure, Chicago isn’t the MLS defending champion, but given their recent displays they should have a field day against Minnesota.

Maybe defense just isn’t Minnesota’s thing? Well they didn’t put on much of an offensive display either. If we’re sticking with twos, that’s also the number of shots on target that Minnesota had, both of which easily ended up in Adam Kwarasey’s gloves. Minnesota failed to create much of anything going forward against Portland and they will be hard pressed to create much against the Fire if Razvan Cocis and Matt Polster are given starts again.

We also have to keep in mind that the Simple Invitational upholds red card suspensions as if they had occurred in the regular season which means Calvano and Venegas will both miss Wednesdays match. This could prove slightly problematic given that Minnesota only has four defenders on their entire roster. Two of those back four slots will have to be filled by trialists or players playing out of position. Who is on trial at Minnesota you ask? None other than two former Fire legends, Chris Ritter and Tony Walls. What an interesting prospect indeed.

Lastly, by their own admission in interviews, these Minnesota players are just getting to know one another on and off the field. That’s fine. It’s what preseason is for. But that doesn’t make Wednesday’s match any easier for the Loons. If Chicago comes out with the high press and attempts to control possession as they have thus far in preseason then Minnesota is in for another loss.

<b>Prediction: </b>Paunovic and company will inspire even the most cynical of doubters on Wednesday. It’s hard to imagine anything other than a win for the Fire. Chicago 4-0. Goossens, Gilberto, Igboananike, and Ritter (og).

Dutch midfielder John Goossens has had an impressive two week run. His wonder goal on Thursday night against the University of Portland and the cool finish against Vancouver followed a good run versus Philadelphia the week before.

During his weekly press conference call, Veljko Paunovic acknowledged his work but noted that there was no update on getting him signed at the moment. "He performed very good. What I can say right now, at this point, his status as a trialist is still the same. If something changes about him, we will let you know," said Paunovic.

Some roster decisions will be made this week with several spots still open. "This week we can make some decisions on the roster and the trialists that we have," said Paunovic. "We want to work building our team. Building with guys on our roster. We have some guys and trialists, we'll try them for different positions in the games to come so we can have a better (idea) of what they can bring to our team."

There will be some players loaned to Saint Louis FC but the decision on who, and how many hasn't been made yet.

<strong>New CB pairing</strong>

Johan Kappelhof and Joao Meira saw their first game action together as the starting centerbacks. There were some struggles but Paunovic said he was satisfied with their outing overall. "We are happy with their performance, being the first game playing together. Against a very good opponent, I think they performed very well. They communicated very well. All of our team, all of our lines, we still have to improve the performance and understanding and our education of what we want to do."

<strong>Ramos arrives</strong>

Right back Rodrigo Ramos joined up with the team this weekend and starting training on Monday. Expect to see him start at least one of the two remaining preseason games. "Today is going to be the first session for him with the whole team. He's adapting to a new environment and we will see the level of his fitness," said Paunovic of the young Brazilian.

<strong>Caution with Accam</strong>

David Accam did not play against Vancouver due to illness. He did not train on Saturday and it seems the Fire will be cautious with his playing time ahead of the season opener on March 6. "He had some issues and we didn't want to make push him hard for this game even though he is recovered now. We working on his fitness, and he is doing great. He's very engaged in this preseason and we have a special approach for him knowing that last year he had issues on turf in this tournament. We are working on him," said Paunovic.

"He's in consideration (for the last two games). It's not that we are reserving, but as I said he had some issues that are not coming from the turf. We want to keep him and recovering well. Our goal is to prepare well for the season. The preseason is something that we have to manage."

<strong>High pressure</strong>

The new system is showing some early results, with the Fire looking to have more purpose than they did for most of last season. High pressure disrupted Vancouver early in the game and resulted in Goosens' strike to give Chicago the lead.

"I'm very with the performance of the team. I always say we have to, and we can, do better. We have to improve but the team is understanding better with how we want to play, and they're convinced that they can do it. They did it yesterday in the game. There were a couple of times we had sets of two or three minutes of the high pressing and we scored one goal. We scored the first goal and we pushed Vancouver a couple of times into an uncomfortable zone with the possession they tried to have."

Paunovic said that the team is still working on fitness and endurance and it was still too early to decide on starters for the opening game.

<strong>Left back</strong>

Brandon Vincent will challenge for a starting spot at left back but Paunovic wasn't conceding that the position is his just yet. "He came very good from the national team camp. He's pushing himself hard. He's got some adjustments to understand some concepts but so far he is doing very good and we are very happy with him," said Paunovic.

"So far, everyone has to earn his spot on the roster at this point in the preseason. Our expectations for all our players is to be available, healthy, prepared, motivated, so that when the team needs them they will ready to play. For him it's the same thing as for everyone."

<strong>Polster takes a stand</strong>

Matt Polster charged into Vancouver players late in the game as a challenge knocked goalkeeper Matt Lampson into the goal. Paunovic liked the fact that Polster was standing up for teammates but wants him to exercise caution going forward. "I think he's a very energetic and very good teammate. He wanted to defend. He reacted. We don't want that to happen but I can understand perfect. He's a young player and he understands that the situation was very dangerous for our goalkeeper. I truly understand what happened. We believe that we have to manage with those situations, to be more calm but at the same time I think that it's good to make others understand that we are guys who care for each other and good teammates. We will always defend our goal like we did in that play. We will always defend one another when someone, in this case someone's health was almost in danger. We understand that perfectly."";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Guillermo Rivera";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5517:"The Fire have three wins from three scheduled preseason games so far but there's still work to do on and off the pitch.

A 3-2 win over the Vancouver Whitecaps featured some shaky moments for a defense that had most of the presumed starters in place for the first time this preseason, but also showed some promise from the high pressure style that coach Veljko Paunovic is looking to deploy.

Trialist John Goossens continues to impress, scoring another goal and playing a good field game. His score in the 5th minute came as a result of pressure on the ball from Matt Polster. An unfortunate bounce in the 24th minute led to an own goal by Johan Kappelof and generous team defending resulted in the second Vancouver score. Gilberto drew a penalty against Kendall Watson in the 51st and converted the spot kick to level the match.

Watson was on the hook again in the 81st when he whistled for a foul on Collin Fernandez in the box, leading to Kennedy Igboananike's penalty kick winner.

"We think that this tournament will help us to see where we are with our roster and at the same time where we are in the preseason and our preparations," said Paunovic after the match. "We were very happy to see that we were capable of playing a good game against a talented rival. The result obviously helps for our confidence to continue improving and building our team."

<p align="center"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Are They All About? Vancouver Whitecaps  </span></b></p>
After another preseason win, a convincing 4-2 dismantling of Philadelphia, Veljko Paunovic had people thinking he was the real deal. Then the Front Office traded fan favorite and home grown hero Harry Shipp to Montreal for a handful of Garber Bucks. As the third phase of preseason begins with the Simple Invitational in Portland the coaching staff has a lot of good will to win back from the fan base. If the Fire can manage to beat a strong Vancouver Whitecaps side on Sunday then the tactics and system that pushed Shipp out will begin to speak for themselves. It has been smooth sailing thus far but playing against a collegiate side and a Union team that looks to have regressed is not a good gauge of progress. Will we see the first defeat of a new era or will more eyebrows be raised?

Vancouver Form Guide: 3-0 in Preseason.

Previous Match: A 2-0 win over win against Houston Dynamo.

Formation: 4-2-3-1; David Ousted; Jordan Smith, Kendall Waston, Christian Dean, Sam Adekugbe; Matías Laba, Russell Teibert; Nicolás Mezquida, Blas Pérez, Cristian Techera; Masato Kudo

<b>Strengths:</b> A team does not finish 2<sup>nd</sup> in the Western Conference without having the proper credentials. The Whitecaps managed to concede a regular season low of just 36 goals while putting away an impressive 45 of their own. They lost to eventual champions Portland in the Western Conference semi-finals but their core remains largely intact so this will not be an easy match for Chicago. There are a few strengths that stick out right away.

Style of Play: Carl Robinson is not new to the league having played for TFC and NYRB, but he is new to coaching with 2015 being his second year in charge. Robinson has however made quite the impression with soccer pundits around the league in those two shorts seasons. Vancouver utilizes a style of play that focuses on organization at the back followed by quickly sprung counter attacks and lethal finishing. On paper it’s what every team strives for but Vancouver has shown it is precise in carrying out its tactics.

Stacked Everywhere: The personnel that Robinson has gathered are a perfect fit for the system they employ. A mix of league veterans, up and coming youngsters from around North American soccer, and a few South American internationals has gelled into a squad that’s enjoyable to watch. Head coaches and GMs all over the league are jealous of Robinson and Vancouver’s success in the player acquisition department.

GK: David Ousted has the unique combination of goalie known for shot stopping but also having the ability to distribute well which often keeps Vancouver in possession and building from the back. Whitecaps fans while be applauding the FO’s ability to sign the keeper to an extended contract this week despite European interest in his services.

Defense: There are teams that dream of a situation in which they can deem Steven Beitashour as surplus after a season that saw him take part in 13 clean sheets, the exact situation Vancouver found themselves in during this transfer window. Had his option been picked up it would have hit the salary cap a bit harder than Robinson would have liked so he was shipped off to TFC. In his place, Vancouver signed 20 year old Canadian international Fraser Aird on loan from Glasgow Rangers to compete against 24 year old Costa Rican international Jordan Smith for a starting spot. Veterans Pa-Modou Kah (who Robinson “salvaged” from Portland), Jordan Harvey and Kendall Waston return to the lineup and will make sure that whichever youngster takes the RB starting spot is ready for the challenge.

Midfield: Vancouver may have lost Mauro Rosales in a trade to Dallas, but their midfield still boasts the creative talents of Matias Laba, Pedro Morales and Cristian Techera, not to mention that they signed Costa Rican international Christian Bolanos. Their ability to control possession, keep the ball moving in meaningful ways and find the perfect pass is scary. Kekuta Manneh’s speed and Russell Teibert’s positional awareness as the “anchor” don’t hurt either. It isn’t the regular season yet but no one has told Vancouver that. They have looked GOOD in all three of their matches so far and viewers should see this bunch absolutely boss the middle of the pitch on Sunday.

Forwards: As if to rub salt in the wounds of Fire fans Chicago will be facing a Vancouver side that has flourished in the South American market. Uruguayan DP Octavio Rivero hit a hot streak early in his tenure as the lone striker and finished the campaign with 10 goals (10 more than most SA Fire signings) while his countryman Nicols Mezquida notched 12 goals in just 18 appearances. Even their troubled Reggae Boy starlet Darren Mattocks contributed three goals and an assist in mostly substitute appearances. Did we mention that they signed Blas Perez from Dallas too? Well they did. The Panamanian marksman hit a bit of a slump last season but a fresh start might suit him.

If Robinson didn’t have a headache from choosing a starter for the only available striker spot, Vancouver just picked up the all-time leading goal scorer for J League’s Kashiwa Reysol, Masato Kudo. With 92 goals in 260 appearances he is not only a proven goal scorer but will most certainly appeal to a specific demographic in Vancouver. What was the price tag on this marketing/goal scoring ploy? Nada. Vancouver picked him up on a free transfer.

If we had to bet, the Whitecaps will certainly feature in the post season again and their work towards that objective will start with a Fire scalp on Sunday. They’ve already decimated three teams that are better than the Fire on paper. With the Simple Invitational being their last phase of preseason they will be looking to impress the boss with a win.

<b>Weaknesses: </b>We relish the opportunity of providing our readers with scintillating storylines but there isn’t really that much to say here. Vancouver’s postseason was cut short by a very good Portland side alongside a mix of injuries, bad luck and an ill-timed dip in form. The usual “underestimating the Fire at their own peril” could be inserted here but with preseason coming to a close sharpness will be a focal point for Vancouver. If we had to pick one weakness it would be their center backs’ lack of speed. Waston, Kah and Harvey aren’t exactly speed demons and if Accam finds himself in space he’ll make them look silly. Gilberto might also find an opening or two with his first touch but that’s about it.

<b>Prediction: </b>The Paunovic honeymoon will be over for the time being. Arguments over doing the dishes, taking the dog out, cleaning up the bathroom and leaving clothes on the floor will ensue. Vancouver 4-1 Chicago. Pick names out of a hat for the Whitecaps’ goal scorers and add a goal to Accam’s European promo video.

After another preseason win, a convincing 4-2 dismantling of Philadelphia, Veljko Paunovic had people thinking he was the real deal.

The Fire’s head coach reiterated that the reasoning for the move was not based on a lack of ability on the player’s part, but more about fitting into the system he is looking to implement.

Here’s more on the call:

<b>On the decision to make the Shipp trade</b>

“At the point when we had the situation with Harry, where we had to decide because there was a team interested in him. At that point, we couldn’t guarantee for Harry that he was going to have the role that everybody and he expected. Then we had to decide and make the best possible decision. Harry will have better possibilities, or better opportunities to play soccer which is something that he always wants. I think that’s basically the main situation. I said before, and I am going to repeat that thousands of times, he’s a fantastic kid. He handled it very, very difficult for him and I can tell (it was difficult) for us too. He moved forward and we’re going to root for him. We appreciate everything that he did for Chicago in the last years. Again, in that situation where we had to decide, I think we did the best possible decision for all parties.”

<b>On Shipp fitting the new style</b>

“I think that’s the first reason. The technical reason is why we decided to do that. The style of play and for what we are looking for further in that position. It’s something that we decided was very important. The first thing is a technical decision, but we are always looking for the best possible solution. If there weren’t a team interested in him, it would be different.”

<b>On replacing Shipp</b>

“We are not going to hurry to do anything at this point. We appreciate everything that Harry did with the club and we understand perfectly the situation. He is a really great, great kid and after our talk on Saturday, Nelson and I really appreciated him higher as a person. He is a really wonderful kid but we’re not in a hurry to replace that spot. We have a situation where we created a spot where the guys we have on the roster right now have to look to fulfill that spot, and fulfill the place in the team as a favorite player on the field for our fans. We think that we created a very interesting dynamic in the roster where the guys that we have right now have to fight for that spot.”

“We are working on our roster. Once we make decisions, we will be very happy to explain everything that we are doing, why are we doing, but right now we don’t have anything to share publicly.”

“We have guys on the roster. They have an opportunity now to show up and prove themselves because there is an open spot. Right now, with the guys we have on the roster, if they will take the opportunity and win the spot. Everybody has to earn it here. Not just for that position, but for every position on the team.”

<b>On filling the leadership void</b>

“Right now we have veteran guys like Razvan (Cocis), like Eric Gehrig. People who have experience in the league and people who have played and understand very well the values of Chicago Fire and our team. Also with Accam, with Kennedy, those guys are very important for our locker room. We’re looking further to see if the new guys who came in like Joao Meira, like Kappelhof who just came yesterday, can bring us another style of leadership with their experience and obviously a style of playing soccer in Europe.”

“With Razvan, and with Sean (Johnson), they’re experienced guys. What we are looking for from them is that we want them to be the example. We want them to represent the best values of our team, and the team we are building. We still have to improve. We need to see that on and off the field. We want to be a team who first do a job, and then talk. We want to see that on and off the field in terms of actions.”

<b>On Gehrig’s recovery</b>

“He is in the process of recovering still. We have a very special treatment for him, where we have to be very aware of his surgery and his current situation. Being out for more than five months is a very delicate situation. He works very hard. He is very enthusiastic. He helps teammates, and staff in order to build our team spirit. He is a really special and great guy. What are doing on our behalf, is to help him not to exceed his peak expectations of coming back as soon as possible, which sometimes can lead to anxiety and some things that we don’t want to happen to get right being hurt or sore. We are being very careful with his process. He’s been great.”

<b>On Arturo Alvarez’s trial</b>

“He’s doing very good. I’m very happy with his attitude and will to accomplish all the tasks and everything that we ask. Arturo is one of them. We are still far from deciding on his side, but I can tell you in the first game he did very good. In the second game, he kept that good performance. We’re looking this week if we can get more from Arturo before we decide.”

<b>On the team development</b>

“I want to see in our team, guys who will take advantage of the situation now and earn the hearts of our fans, our staff, and other players. That’s what we are looking for in this situation. We want to convert the situation to a positive dynamic, where the players will be eager to play in a way the fans love and obviously, win for our team.”

“It’s a long term answer. Confidence and trust takes a long time to win. Hopefully we will get it.”

<b>On style of play and preseason work</b>

“We work on our mentality because mentality ignites our physical strength. Physical strength is something that is a support for our technique, technical and tactical side.”

“If we have a strong mentality, where we will understand concepts of the game. (We will know) What we have to do. When we have to do it, and how we have to do it.”

<b>On Johan Kappelhof</b>

“As he describes himself, and that’s what I liked in the interview that Nelson and I had with him before we decided to sign him, he said ‘I love to defend’, ‘I love the challenge of playing 1v1 and I’m really engaged in defending our goal’. At the same time what we saw him and how he took our attention in him was a soccer player who wants to play, build out of the back, who is committed with possession of the ball. In progression, he has a very good quality pass. His decisions are very good. He is a defender. That defensive mentality and defensive attitude is contagious, and that is what we are expecting from him. When we have to defend, because that’s the style of the game, what we expect from him is to be one of the leaders in our defensive line and (pass that attitude to) everyone in front of him.”

<b>On expectations for David Accam</b>

“What we are trying to teach in our style is that everyone is responsible for attack, and everyone is responsible for the defense and everyone has his role in those aspects of the game. We know that David is very important for us, but they all are. What we want to explain, is how we proceed in order to find David, so that David can excel in his talents for him, for our team, and for the best of our club. But it’s the same thing for everyone else. As you saw so far in the preseason, David is doing very good. He is pushing himself, which is something we wanted to see before the season started because we never worked together. He’s capable of that. He’s going to be very important this year.”

<b>On Matt Polster </b>

“He came after the national team camp. He was very, very excited and worked hard. He’s a young guy, full of potential, full of energy, which we have to channelize. We have to channelize his passion, his will to give his best in every possession and every game, which is very important. At the same time, we have to put that under control. That control has to come from him, and that’s what we are working on with him. We really think that he has potential. He has big value in our club, and in our league.”

<b>On national team player attitudes</b>

“From my experience, every player that comes after the national team camp and national team games, they are better. They are (full) of that spirit of national team. I can talk about Serbia, it’s always the highest expectations. When you see people all around you with the same values, and the same way of thinking that really makes you a better person, and a better player. What we expect from those guys, when they come back to their club, is to do the same in their environment.”

<b>On Kennedy Igboananike’s spot</b>

“Like everyone else, he has to earn his role in our team. So far he has worked very hard. He’s doing good. His attitude is good and he has to earn the spot in the team.

<b>On Collin Fernandez and young players</b>

“Everyone has a high level of hard working attitude, will to learn, and to improve. Collin is one of them too. We work on our team (from a) collective point of view, and also on the individual. Collin has the same attention from our staff as everyone else. He is a very good kid, and he needs to understand that from my experience in working from those ages, is the main shift for all youngsters will be the transition from the youth to senior level professional soccer. This is where we want to help him and Mauricio (Pineda) and other guys in order to have a future prospect for our club. It depends on them, and it depends on us and how well we do our job. Everybody has to do their part.”

The Fire’s head coach reiterated that the reasoning for the move was not based on a lack of ability on the player’s part, but more about fitting into the system he is looking to implement.

Here’s more on the call:

<b>On the decision to make the Shipp trade</b>

“At the point when we had the situation with Harry, where we had to decide because there was a team interested in him. At that point, we couldn’t guarantee for Harry that he was going to have the role that everybody and he expected. Then we had to decide and make the best possible decision. Harry will have better possibilities, or better opportunities to play soccer which is something that he always wants. I think that’s basically the main situation. I said before, and I am going to repeat that thousands of times, he’s a fantastic kid. He handled it very, very difficult for him and I can tell (it was difficult) for us too. He moved forward and we’re going to root for him. We appreciate everything that he did for Chicago in the last years. Again, in that situation where we had to decide, I think we did the best possible decision for all parties.”

<b>On Shipp fitting the new style</b>

“I think that’s the first reason. The technical reason is why we decided to do that. The style of play and for what we are looking for further in that position. It’s something that we decided was very important. The first thing is a technical decision, but we are always looking for the best possible solution. If there weren’t a team interested in him, it would be different.”

<b>On replacing Shipp</b>

“We are not going to hurry to do anything at this point. We appreciate everything that Harry did with the club and we understand perfectly the situation. He is a really great, great kid and after our talk on Saturday, Nelson and I really appreciated him higher as a person. He is a really wonderful kid but we’re not in a hurry to replace that spot. We have a situation where we created a spot where the guys we have on the roster right now have to look to fulfill that spot, and fulfill the place in the team as a favorite player on the field for our fans. We think that we created a very interesting dynamic in the roster where the guys that we have right now have to fight for that spot.”

“We are working on our roster. Once we make decisions, we will be very happy to explain everything that we are doing, why are we doing, but right now we don’t have anything to share publicly.”

“We have guys on the roster. They have an opportunity now to show up and prove themselves because there is an open spot. Right now, with the guys we have on the roster, if they will take the opportunity and win the spot. Everybody has to earn it here. Not just for that position, but for every position on the team.”

<b>On filling the leadership void</b>

“Right now we have veteran guys like Razvan (Cocis), like Eric Gehrig. People who have experience in the league and people who have played and understand very well the values of Chicago Fire and our team. Also with Accam, with Kennedy, those guys are very important for our locker room. We’re looking further to see if the new guys who came in like Joao Meira, like Kappelhof who just came yesterday, can bring us another style of leadership with their experience and obviously a style of playing soccer in Europe.”

“With Razvan, and with Sean (Johnson), they’re experienced guys. What we are looking for from them is that we want them to be the example. We want them to represent the best values of our team, and the team we are building. We still have to improve. We need to see that on and off the field. We want to be a team who first do a job, and then talk. We want to see that on and off the field in terms of actions.”

<b>On Gehrig’s recovery</b>

“He is in the process of recovering still. We have a very special treatment for him, where we have to be very aware of his surgery and his current situation. Being out for more than five months is a very delicate situation. He works very hard. He is very enthusiastic. He helps teammates, and staff in order to build our team spirit. He is a really special and great guy. What are doing on our behalf, is to help him not to exceed his peak expectations of coming back as soon as possible, which sometimes can lead to anxiety and some things that we don’t want to happen to get right being hurt or sore. We are being very careful with his process. He’s been great.”

<b>On Arturo Alvarez’s trial</b>

“He’s doing very good. I’m very happy with his attitude and will to accomplish all the tasks and everything that we ask. Arturo is one of them. We are still far from deciding on his side, but I can tell you in the first game he did very good. In the second game, he kept that good performance. We’re looking this week if we can get more from Arturo before we decide.”

<b>On the team development</b>

“I want to see in our team, guys who will take advantage of the situation now and earn the hearts of our fans, our staff, and other players. That’s what we are looking for in this situation. We want to convert the situation to a positive dynamic, where the players will be eager to play in a way the fans love and obviously, win for our team.”

“It’s a long term answer. Confidence and trust takes a long time to win. Hopefully we will get it.”

<b>On style of play and preseason work</b>

“We work on our mentality because mentality ignites our physical strength. Physical strength is something that is a support for our technique, technical and tactical side.”

“If we have a strong mentality, where we will understand concepts of the game. (We will know) What we have to do. When we have to do it, and how we have to do it.”

<b>On Johan Kappelhof</b>

“As he describes himself, and that’s what I liked in the interview that Nelson and I had with him before we decided to sign him, he said ‘I love to defend’, ‘I love the challenge of playing 1v1 and I’m really engaged in defending our goal’. At the same time what we saw him and how he took our attention in him was a soccer player who wants to play, build out of the back, who is committed with possession of the ball. In progression, he has a very good quality pass. His decisions are very good. He is a defender. That defensive mentality and defensive attitude is contagious, and that is what we are expecting from him. When we have to defend, because that’s the style of the game, what we expect from him is to be one of the leaders in our defensive line and (pass that attitude to) everyone in front of him.”

<b>On expectations for David Accam</b>

“What we are trying to teach in our style is that everyone is responsible for attack, and everyone is responsible for the defense and everyone has his role in those aspects of the game. We know that David is very important for us, but they all are. What we want to explain, is how we proceed in order to find David, so that David can excel in his talents for him, for our team, and for the best of our club. But it’s the same thing for everyone else. As you saw so far in the preseason, David is doing very good. He is pushing himself, which is something we wanted to see before the season started because we never worked together. He’s capable of that. He’s going to be very important this year.”

<b>On Matt Polster </b>

“He came after the national team camp. He was very, very excited and worked hard. He’s a young guy, full of potential, full of energy, which we have to channelize. We have to channelize his passion, his will to give his best in every possession and every game, which is very important. At the same time, we have to put that under control. That control has to come from him, and that’s what we are working on with him. We really think that he has potential. He has big value in our club, and in our league.”

I can talk about Serbia, it’s always the highest expectations. When you see people all around you with the same values, and the same way of thinking that really makes you a better person, and a better player.

<b>On Kennedy Igboananike’s spot</b>

“Like everyone else, he has to earn his role in our team. So far he has worked very hard. He’s doing good. His attitude is good and he has to earn the spot in the team.

<b>On Collin Fernandez and young players</b>

“Everyone has a high level of hard working attitude, will to learn, and to improve. Collin is one of them too. We work on our team (from a) collective point of view, and also on the individual. Collin has the same attention from our staff as everyone else. He is a very good kid, and he needs to understand that from my experience in working from those ages, is the main shift for all youngsters will be the transition from the youth to senior level professional soccer.
