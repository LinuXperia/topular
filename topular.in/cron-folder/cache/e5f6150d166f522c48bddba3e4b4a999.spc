When shopping for point applications or enterprise software systems, buyers face a familiar dilemma. Best-of-breed or single-source? Is it better to purchase the best components possible and make sure they all work together? Or, is it preferable to work with one supplier who will take responsibility for installing and supporting the entire package?</p>
<p>For companies in mission-critical industries – especially those that are contemplating a move to the cloud – the trend is to find and rely on a single vendor for delivery, hosting, services and ongoing support.</p>
<p>Why is this so important? Working with a single supplier means that companies can stop worrying about what’s called “contact chaos.” The routine is familiar. Every time a new business need arises that involves software, the customer starts looking for a new application to add to the technology stack. Multiple vendors are evaluated. Contracts are negotiated. Software is purchased and installed (in-house or in the data center.) Sometimes new hardware is also acquired to run the software. Integration with existing systems is undertaken. Then something doesn’t work quite right, and the contact cycle begins again. Often with finger-pointing and unanticipated costs involved.</p>
<p>Companies are finding that a single-vendor strategy offers four key advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quicker procurement. </strong>New software can be purchased and implemented under existing contract frameworks, enabling customers to turn business-driven technology initiatives into reality sooner than when working with multiple vendors. This translates into faster ROI.</li>
<li><strong>Faster delivery. </strong>When working with a single vendor, new software developments can follow the same style of usability and open integration. By unifying these development processes, new features and applications can be rolled out faster than ever before, and media company staff members will require less training to get up to speed. As a result, the infrastructure will be in place to deploy new software at a much more rapid pace, without all the preflight checks normally required when taking on new vendor applications.</li>
<li><strong>Smoother migrations.</strong> The demands and daily pressures of the business mean that media companies want a clear and straightforward upgrade path to move their existing platforms to the cloud. This means simple and automated migration tools to transfer existing content and commercial data, as well as documentation that is written in a like-for-like style to help ease the transition for all users. In short, media companies want a migration plan that enables them to preserve their existing technology investments and extend these investments at a pace driven by business requirements — not vendor pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Greater transparency</strong>. Media companies are showing a preference for vendors that use an agile development methodology for all software development and product management activities. IT users and business stakeholders want more input and deeper insight into the roadmap process than ever before. As roadmaps are being advanced, media companies want to see progress early in the development cycle and provide valuable feedback to the product management team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, Saugatuck Technology conducted its annual cloud buyer demand survey of 218 senior IT, business and finance executives across a broad spectrum of company sizes and geographies. More than 80% of the participants held titles of Director or above, with a wide range of industries represented. When given a choice between buying software (1) as a single vendor suite, (2) as a collection of best-of-breed point solutions, or (3) as a loosely coupled multiple vendor solution, respondents chose core business and finance platforms as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>58% prefer the single-vendor suite model</li>
<li>25% prefer the best-of-breed approach</li>
<li>17% prefer the multi-vendor approach</li>
</ul>
<p>The independent Saugatuck study draws that conclusion that “As cloud solutions get more complex and deeper into the enterprise, the trend toward single-vendor, integrated business suites is clearly taking root, across all solution categories.” Taken together, 83% of buyers across all business units prefer single-vendor or best-of-breed solutions, compared to only 17% preferring multiple suppliers.</p>
<p>At its most prosaic level, the single-source model means one throat to choke when problems arise and one cheek to kiss when everything is running smoothly. And, especially in a deadline-driven, mission-critical 24/7 industries, no one has any time or tolerance for finger pointing.</p>

Almost 40% of online news consumers‎ get content exclusively on mobile devices. Compare this to people who use desktops or laptops to access newspaper content, which dropped to 32%, according to the latest ComScore data reported by the Newspaper Association of America.</p>
<p>So, how can news media companies continue to cultivate this coveted mobile-only-al audience? Here are three things you need to know.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create content with little screens and large interruptions in mind</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Mobile-only audiences are easily distracted and don’t stick around for very long. Consider that newspaper websites represent less than 0.2 percent of browsing time spent on smartphones and only 0.4 percent on tablets.</p>
<p>Mobile-only visitors want a simple, seamless path to the information they’ve come for. They generally don’t want too many choices, and they certainly won’t tolerate performance delays. They expect to land on an uncluttered article page that loads quickly and makes the content easy to read.</p>
<p>Interestingly, mobile-only-als will respond favorably if you give them something to read next. They will stick around longer if you show them other most popular content, rather than content that’s closely related to what they’ve just read. Why? Because they’re looking for things to share with others.</p>
<p>At the recent INMA Mobile Summit in Austin, Dr. Mario Garcia touched on this when he referenced the mobile editor as next critical newsroom job. The mobile editor’s responsibility, according to Dr. Garcia, is “Curating in a hurry for an audience that thrives on frequent interruptions.”</p>
<p>Mobile-only-als prefer facts more than analysis, and short over long content. Still, as Dr. Garcia notes, because of the continual distractions and <em>everywhereness</em> of the mobile experience, “Good headline writing has never been more important.”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Segment your mobile content, not your audience</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Mobile-only audiences don’t want to be put in a box. They don’t want to be targeted with news and advertising content based on some assumed audience segmentation data. Instead, they want content that automatically adapts to their behaviors, preferences, context, location, and time of day. They also enjoy the serendipity of discovering content that stimulates new interests and gives them something to talk about with others.</p>
<p>Look at it this way. The mobile-only-al generation is growing up in a K-12 and college education environment that is increasingly based on adaptive learning technologies. Adaptive learning combines cognitive psychology and computer science. It automatically modifies and personalizes the presentation of educational material based on user interaction, device, and learning capabilities. This is the kind of targeting experience – rather than one that relies simply on first and third party cookies – that will resonate most effectively with the mobile-only generation.</p>
<p>To create segmented content that appeals to mobile-only-als, think particle not article. Traditionally, the article has been viewed as the smallest editorial element or component that <span style="line-height: 1.6;">can stand on its own. The article is often called the newsroom’s “atomic unit.” With mobile, however, the smallest news chunks can be sentences, paragraphs, facts, lists, infographics, or images. These elements can be combined in different ways, daisy chained together, or consumed on their own.</span></p>
<p>An effective mobile news experience uses these particles, or story segments, as part of a complete storytelling process. The segments can be re-ordered and expanded as new information is added or breaking news updates become available. Once again, the focus should be on preparing mobile content designed for consumption on small screens by on-the-go audiences who are busy, bored or both.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Make mobile search a priority</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>More than half of all mobile-only-als find news media content as the result of a search. Companies like Microsoft and Google understand the critical role that search plays in the mobile experience.</p>
<p>Consider this recent announcement from Google: “Starting April 21 [2015], we will be expanding our use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. This change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results.”</p>
<p>“Significant impact.” These are not words that Google uses lightly. Starting with its Hummingbird technology a few years ago, Google continues to develop search algorithms that are optimized for mobile. Bing Mobile, Yahoo! Search and others are following suit. They know that mobile users want search results faster and expect these results to be immediately relevant.</p>
<p>The newest mobile search algorithms shift the focus away from keywords and toward intent and semantics. News editors need to understand that stuffing mobile pages and headlines with SEO-friendly keywords is no longer going to improve search rankings. Today, key phrases are far more important than keywords.</p>
<p>A simple rule-of-thumb is to write in the same manner as you would search, because this is how mobile audiences are going to find your content. A conversational style is key here. Write as if you were answering a question. According to Google’s search guru, Matt Cutts, “It’s about things, not strings.”</p>
<p>With April 21 fast approaching, every newspaper company should pay attention to the changes coming in mobile search. Revisit your mobile SEO (search engine optimization) strategy to make sure your mobile-only audiences are continuing to find you and continuing to stay engaged.</p>
<p>If the recent ComScore findings are any indication, the mobile-only-al generation is due for yet another growth spurt.</p>

<a href='http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/team/peter-marsh/' onclick='return popitup(this.href, 500, 500);' class='simple_popup_link '>By Peter Marsh, NEWSCYCLE Solutions, Vice President of Marketing</a>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">March 2, 2015</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ROI-Blog-Image.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-6327 size-medium" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ROI-Blog-Image-300x204.jpg" alt="ROI-Blog-Image" width="300" height="204" /></a>Newscycle recently conducted a survey of more than 200 news media executives, directors and managers. We asked respondents to rank their most important business priorities through the end of 2015. Over 51% said that “audience engagement, targeting and personalization” was a high priority, and a whopping 78% put “reporting, analytics and business intelligence” at the top of their to-do lists.</p>
<p>We decided to explore these findings in greater detail by interviewing business leaders from 20 North American news media companies that have successfully implemented analytics and audience engagement solutions. Specifically, we reached out to companies that have achieved a measurable return on investment from initiatives designed to improve circulation analytics and advertising business intelligence. We also talked with companies that have boosted audience revenues through greater engagement, targeting, and personalization.</p>
<p><strong>Circulation Analytics</strong><br />
A Senior Vice President of Circulation for a mid-sized U.S. newspaper company said, “We were able to reduce the time spent on regularly generated reports by over 50%,” by implementing an automated analytics solution in the circulation department. “In addition, we are saving 1-2 hours per week on chargeback reports and saving one full time job just on single copy reporting, pilferage tracking, etc.”</p>
<p>Another publisher created a circulation analytics dashboard to give managers a more thorough view of sales and return activity. “It is now much easier to track single copy sell-outs and returns, and the information the system provides is current,” said the newspaper’s Circulation Operations Director. The publisher created an analytics dashboard to help suggest supply alterations, and as a result, she reports that “Single copy revenue has increased by 2-4%.”</p>
<p>Marketers also see value in circulation analytics as a tool to provide immediate access to information that helps identify opportunities among existing customers. This includes combo subscription reporting, circulation growth, changes in service levels, and the integration of external segmentation and demographic data. One newspaper Marketing Manager told us, “We can now see regions that are underdeveloped in terms of household penetration, which is new information. This gives us the ability to develop targeted marketing campaigns to help drive subscription sales.”</p>
<p><strong>Advertising Analytics</strong><br />
Using a variety of analytics tools and business intelligence technologies, media companies are benefitting from the ability to gain accurate information and timely insight into advertising sales trends, advertiser satisfaction and retention. These are key to driving increased ad revenue.</p>
<p>The Ad Director at one mid-sized U.S. newspaper company told us that advertiser churn had been as high as 50%. By focusing on better and deeper advertising analytics, her company has turned this trend around. Previously, as many as 70-75% of all ads were sold at a discount. Today, the analytics tool provides greater insight into ad performance and enables sales reps to show advertisers the real value of their campaigns, as well as to target ads based on demographics, geography and contextually relevant content.</p>
<p>Like circulation analytics, several publishers report that the implementation of an automated advertising analytics tool has decreased the time spent on generating reports by as much as 70-90%. In addition, one IT Director said, “Better advertiser management can actually help with subscriber retention and circulation numbers as well. There are subscribers who say ‘I get the paper for the grocery circular’ or ‘I know this paper carries this hardware store&#8217;s flyer so this is why I purchase it.’ Retaining key advertisers can therefore also help retain subscribers.”</p>
<p><strong>Audience Engagement and Targeting</strong><br />
Most media companies see the potential revenue upside associated with delivering targeted and contextually relevant news and advertising content to their audiences. However, attracting new subscribers – and keeping existing subscribers – is on-going work that requires constant effort and frequent updates. Relevant content needs to be continually refreshed in order to attract visitors to a site and to keep them coming back. This is difficult to do without having a complete profile of each user, along with a technology solution to help automate the process.</p>
<p>In the words of an IT and Operations Director who currently does this job manually, “We spend four to five hours a day, a couple of days a week, on reporting and collecting data on target audiences. This time could be significantly reduced going forward with an audience engagement tool.”</p>
<p>For media companies that have invested in an automated audience engagement and targeting solution, the effort is clearly paying off. Subscription sales are growing and ad revenue is increasing. One media company in New England reports that digital-only subscriptions jumped by 410% over three years after implementing an audience targeting tool. In addition, by serving up relevant content to casual and anonymous site visitors, the publisher was able to increase the number of registered users by 9% over the same 3-year time period.</p>
<p>“Audience targeting provides a platform from which to sell ads,” according to a senior Marketing Director we interviewed. “Our focus on automated audience engagement,” he added, “has helped generate significant month over month growth due to the more effective targeting that can now be offered to advertisers.”</p>
<p>Automated audience engagement solutions give media companies the ability to target readers’ unique interests based on the content they read. Often, this includes built-in predictive analytics to understand reader behavior based upon time of day, device, context, and personal preferences. The net result is that visitors will see in real-time the targeted content they want displayed alongside the ads that appeal to them.</p>
<p>From an ROI perspective, an investment in audience technology has helped one publisher increase the time visitors spend reading online articles from an average of 3 minutes to 13 minutes. Furthermore, the bounce rate (readers who come to the site, read one article, then disappear) has been reduced from 39% to 21% after implementing an audience engagement and targeting tool.<br />
Clearly, there is a measurable return on investment for media companies that have taken the time to implement new technologies and business processes designed to enhance their analytics and audience development efforts. This certainly helps to explain why such initiatives appear so high up on senior executive to-do lists.</p>

<p>January 23, 2014<br />
<a href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015yearimage.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6233" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015yearimage.jpg" alt="2015yearimage" width="230" height="164" /></a>The number 2015 is a palindrome in binary (11111011111). Just ask Sheldon, Leonard, Amy or anyone in your IT department. Do we need any clearer sign that 2015 will be heralded as <em>The Year of the Geek</em>?</p>
<p>We can look back at 2014 as the year media companies began experimenting with – and, in some cases, launching – initiatives that focused on things like wearable technologies, robot journalism, algorithmic news curation, and programmatic trading. Early predictions indicate that 2015 is bound to see even greater advances in the meaningful and money-making coalescence between news publishing and technology.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems totally appropriate to kick off 2015 with a not-so-big bang by listing several three-letter acronyms that every tech savvy media executive should pay attention to this year. In roughly alphabetical order, here goes:</p>
<p><strong>1. BSI (Build Security In)</strong><br />
BSI is a set of principles, practices, rules and tools to design software systems that enhance resistance to vulnerabilities, flaws, and attacks. With the recent cyber-attacks against Sony Pictures, and the extended threats to news media organizations, it is vitally important that we raise the bar for software security to a higher level than ever before. BSI is a collaborative effort that provides resources for software developers, architects, IT managers, and security practitioners to use in assuring security throughout every phase of software design, development and deployment.</p>
<p><strong>2. COS (Content Optimization System)</strong><br />
When you take a content management system and optimize it so that it can deliver the most personalized and contextually relevant experience for your visitors, you have a COS. Creating a COS –or turning your current CMS into a COS – should be one of the key goals of every media company’s web publishing platform.</p>
<p><strong>3. CPA (Cost Per Action)</strong><br />
CPA is an advertising pricing model where an advertiser pays for each specific action someone takes on an ad. These actions can include clicking on an ad, completing a form, or making a purchase. Advertisers often prefer CPA to traditional pricing models like CPM (cost per 1000 impressions), mainly because cost-per-action ties more closely to conversion. The thinking is that if a consumer takes an action, he or she is more likely to buy the product or service the advertiser is offering. Other relatively new pricing models that are gaining in popularity for 2015 include CPE (cost-per-engagement) and CPF (cost-per-follower/fan) for social media, CPI (cost per app install) for mobile, and CPV (cost-per-view) for online video.</p>
<p><strong>4. CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization)</strong><br />
Combining the two concepts above, CRO is the process of improving your web or mobile site’s conversion rate by using design techniques, key optimization principles, and A/B testing. For media companies, the goal of CRO is to get a higher percentage of your web visitors to take actions such as signing up for an event, responding to an article, interacting with an ad, or becoming a subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>5. DSP (Demand-Side Platform)</strong><br />
A DSP is a software technology that centralizes ad buying and planning. In short, a DSP allows agencies and advertisers to purchase ad inventory in an automated – often called programmatic – manner. The idea behind a DSP is to create an efficient tool to purchase media, where impressions can be bought across multiple publishers, and according to demographics, location, and other data. DSP’s became popular when advertisers and agencies decided they did not want to pay online ad buyers to negotiate with media company sales reps on things like ad pricing and scheduling. DSP technology automates the whole negotiating and ad buying process, and ostensibly makes online ad sales more efficient and cost-effective.</p>
<p><strong>6. SSP (Supply-Side Platform)</strong><br />
The advent of DSP’s created a challenge for media companies, mainly because such automated technology runs the risk of driving down the value of publishers’ inventory. Therefore, SSPs were invented to help publishers maintain the value of their inventory and to more efficiently sell ads through multiple ad networks and buyers. An SSP is a centralized way for publishers to automate and optimize media buys. SSP’s are basically publisher equivalents of DSP’s. The SSP model is designed for publishers who have inventory to sell, whereas DSP’s are designed as trading platforms for advertisers and agencies. Publishers use an SSP to manage their ad inventory and maximize revenue from impressions. Today, publishers rely on SSP’s to sell inventory that their sales teams are unable to sell. SSP’s are also being used more and more as “traffic cops.” Rather than selling the inventory, the SSP’s help in serving and tracking ad campaigns sold directly by the media company’s sales teams.</p>
<p><strong>7. VRJ (Virtual Reality Journalism)</strong><br />
Saving the geekiest for last, VRJ is truly all the rage for 2015. Thanks to immersive 3D consumer technologies like Oculus Rift, Canon MREAL and Sony Morpheus, news consumption is becoming a virtual reality experience. If you’re not familiar with VRJ, just take a look at the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2014/09/17/harvest-of-change-virtual-farm-virtual-reality/15785377/" target="_blank">Harvest of Change</a> project that The Des Moines Register and Gannett Digital created this past September. Using 360-degree video and virtual reality technology from Oculus, this VRJ project is an immersive form of non-fiction storytelling that gives users a first-person, full-body experience of life inside a family farm in Iowa. As Mitch Gelman, Gannett Digital Vice President of Product, said in a recent interview with Poynter, “This is the way we, as journalists, are going to need to communicate to the Minecraft generation.”</p>

<a href='http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/team/peter-marsh/' onclick='return popitup(this.href, 500, 500);' class='simple_popup_link '>By Peter Marsh, NEWSCYCLE Solutions, Vice President of Marketing</a>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">December 22, 2014</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Ad-Fraud-Blog-Image.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6203" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Ad-Fraud-Blog-Image-300x200.jpg" alt="Ad-Fraud-Blog-Image" width="300" height="200" /></a>You can’t monetize what you can’t measure. Everybody knows that. It’s why publishers and advertisers strive to get meaningful metrics that gauge audience engagement and accurately measure the success of online ad campaigns.</p>
<p>But, did you know that over a third of all traffic to media company websites is fake? The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) recently found that 36 percent of people clicking on digital ads are not human at all. The visitors are “bots”, the product of computers hijacked by fraudsters and programmed to visit sites.</p>
<p>Bot fraud is rampant in all forms of online advertising – web, mobile, social, video – but the problem is especially troubling for news media publishers, where trust and credibility are key to the longstanding relationships between advertisers, audiences and media company brands.</p>
<p>Simply put, digital ad fraud means that advertisers are paying for impressions that appear to be served to real audiences, but are actually “seen” only by computers. Millions of ad impressions are generated every day that are never seen by a human. In one recent case reported by the Financial Times, Mercedes Benz ran an online ad campaign where 57 percent of the impressions were viewed by automated computer programs rather than real people.</p>
<p>Fraudsters use lots of tricks to deceive advertisers and unsuspecting computer users alike, with the goal of illegitimately making money from online ad campaigns. Here’s how it might happen:</p>
<p>1. An innocent computer user, let’s call him Dave, turned on his computer one day and perhaps visited a random site and clicked on a compromised link, or maybe he ran a “certified and safe” cleanup program.</p>
<p>2. At that moment, a fraudulent bot engine was quietly installed on Dave’s computer. (This same thing happened to thousands of innocent Daves on computers, tablets and even mobile devices all over the world.)</p>
<p>3. Later that day, without Dave’s knowledge, the bot engine began communicating with a botnet center located anywhere from Altadena to Zagreb. Dave’s computer was turned into a zombie, and his bot was instructed to visit certain sites in a certain sequence and at a certain frequency.</p>
<p>4. This is the really scary part. The botnet center was so sophisticated that it instructed Dave’s bot to visit high-value audience sites, including news media websites, in order to profile Dave as an ideal candidate for advertisers.</p>
<p>5. Dave’s bot was also programmed to go to sites that promote themselves as “advertising impression storefronts” that drive “real unique visitors.”</p>
<p>6. Website owners and ad networks need to drive traffic, so they purchase impressions from these storefront sites. In reality, these sites are owned by the botnet fraudsters, who collect the money, then send traffic through the nodes in the bot network (like Dave’s computer) and serve ads on pages that are never seen by human beings.</p>
<p>A scary scenario indeed. What’s even scarier is that the digital ad fraud problem is bound to grow as the trend toward greater programmatic buying and selling increases. By removing the human element from direct ad sales, the fraudsters will inevitably find more opportunities to deceive.</p>
<p>So, what’s a publisher to do in order to combat bot fraud? The very good news here is that organizations like the IAB and the Alliance for Audited Media (AAM) are taking proactive steps to help publishers, advertisers and technology companies in their quest to eliminate digital ad fraud. Admittedly, both organizations liken these efforts to playing whack-a-mole – eliminate ad fraud in one area and it quickly pops up in another. Still, the following guidelines for media publishers provide some useful and immediate action items to defeat the fraudsters.</p>
<p>These efforts will help publishers preserve the trust and integrity of their valuable ad inventories:</p>
<p>• As a publisher, you must educate yourself about ad traffic fraud.<br />
• Monitor and vet all traffic sources to ensure the highest quality traffic to your sites. Pay close attention to those sources that are compensated for bringing traffic to websites.<br />
• Only trust business partners that have earned trust. The IAB calls this “practicing safe sourcing.” Technology can be implemented to help detect and prevent fraud. In addition, traffic to media sites can be filtered through third-party vendors who specialize in fraud detection.<br />
• Policies and procedures should be adopted to help eliminate low-level ad fraud. One example of this, according to the IAB, is “comparing impression volumes to audience sizes reported by third-party measurement services.”<br />
• Include the right to audit in all agreements with traffic providers.<br />
• Get involved with – and become certified with – the IAB’s Quality Assurance Guidelines and other fraud initiatives, including the Traffic of Good Intent Task Force, which offers a framework for best practices that promote brand safety and trust.</p>
<p>Finally, publishers and advertisers alike dearly want to measure the actual impact of ad campaigns. No one wants results that are diluted by ads that never have a chance of being viewed by human eyeballs. Better measurement provides greater justification for advertisers to shift budgets to the quality digital inventory that media companies can offer.</p>
<p>Therefore, publishers need to set clear objectives that focus on measurements of true ROI, which is difficult for botnet fraudsters to falsify. Metrics based on click-through rates, completion rates, and last-touch attribution alone are weak because these can be easily faked by fraudulent bot agents. On the other hand, impressions that are fully validated will better align the goals of advertisers and publishers with those of consumers. This, in turn, will lead to a better digital experience that respects all audience members and delivers higher quality rather than higher quantity.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">December 15, 2014</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/magnifying-glass.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6180" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/magnifying-glass.jpg" alt="magnifying-glass" width="300" height="225" /></a>What are you doing? Yes, you, what are you doing and why are you doing it?</p>
<p>Organizations are built around tasks, routines, workflows and processes. We need these structures to get work done. But do we ever ask why? Do we question our processes, audit them, and make them earn their keep?</p>
<p>We are often forced to ask “why” due to outside forces. Adapting to change causes us to step out of the lane we’re in. Sometimes we step into oncoming traffic, sometimes into a faster lane and sometimes we end up in the ditch.</p>
<p>What if we routinely look at the whys (wise!) of our processes? What if we examine our work absent any external disruption? I believe the results of such an introspection are greater efficiency, less confusion, more effective training, more nimble teams and more capacity!</p>
<p>What if management expected teams to look at their processes and ask why? What if someone from outside the process, either a vendor, a consultant or someone from another area of the organization, asked and tried to learn the reasons behind each step in the workflow?</p>
<p>A great way to get started is to think about documenting your processes. Documenting workflows has many benefits. It helps everyone to understand the big picture. When new team members come on board they have accurate documentation to explain how the work is done. When Mary is out sick, Bob may be able to refer to some documentation and pitch in. Similarly for those processes that don’t happen regularly, documentation helps to ensure it gets done consistently when the need arises.</p>
<p>I once worked on a project to move a newsroom’s production system to a new, integrated system. The implementation team thought we were doing a great job of adapting workflows to take advantage of the strengths of the new system. When finished we patted ourselves on our backs and moved on to new challenges.</p>
<p>Later, I was working with a page designer and noticed several initials at the top of the story he was working on. They were the initials of the copy editors who had edited the story. Why were users putting their initials at the top of stories? The new system had a built-in track changes feature that kept track of all of the changes made to a story. Each story had an edit trail so with a keystroke any user could go back through each version and see who had made changes to a story.</p>
<p>Finally, the Adobe applications we used had Notes Mode which users loved &#8212; all notes were individually tracked by user and time. Why did this workflow persist? The most common answer was that if someone wanted to discuss a change with the person who made it, they needed to know with whom to talk. Okay. That made perfect sense. But what about the capabilities of the new system?</p>
<p>Don’t overlook automated processes. Automation is great, but what if you can simplify, remove points of failure, make processes easier to understand and maintain?</p>
<p>Also consider the software that you already own. Engage with your vendor or attend a user group to ensure you’re taking advantage of the tools at your fingertips.</p>
<p>I once worked with a team that was trying to refine their photographer’s workflow. They had a variety of tools for writing captions and doing FTP transfers. What we learned was that Adobe Bridge did it all and they already owned Adobe Bridge. They could eliminate a half dozen other programs and simplify the workflow. This also made it easier for the I.T. department to provision computers. It also was a cross-platform solution: the workflow was the same for Mac or Windows users.</p>
<p>Accumulated efficiencies can give teams incrementally more capacity. That’s the flexibility to be nimble when a big story breaks. You improve your ability to cover for sickness and vacation.</p>
<p>You won’t realize any savings if you don’t look for them. Let’s get started!</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a workflow. Small or large; technical or manual; internal or public-facing, pick something!</li>
<li>Select a team. Comprise the team of people who use the workflow every day as well as at least one person who is outside the loop. It may be easier for the outsider to ask the “Whys?” and they are less likely to make assumptions. Assumptions can lead you down just as many dark alleys as a bad process itself.</li>
<li>Give the team a pep-talk! It’s okay if they come out of the process without any changes. But they need to review it step-by-step.</li>
<li>The team needs to deliver a workflow document at the end. Include in the document the names of those making key decisions. For example if Lindsay determines that all images need a copyright statement in their IPTC header, that note should be in the document so there’s no question who made that decision. If significant changes to the existing workflow are recommended by the team, they may want to consider a workflow map that explains “this is how we used to do it” and “this is how we will do it.”</li>
<li>Almost as important is to not let all of this work and documentation stagnate. Set a regular review period on all of the documents produced. Use any mechanism that makes sense, but regularly review the documentation, perhaps annually, and ask the “whys” again! Maybe something has changed. Maybe new software has been introduced. Maybe you’re doing something nobody needs any longer. Maybe you’re doing something that actually impairs the work of another team but they don’t know it can be changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then repeat the process for other teams and workflows.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for a truck to be barreling down on you, forcing you to make changes. Proactively make the investment. The findings almost certainly will surprise you!</p>
<p>That’s why!</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6041" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/If-its-tuesday-blog-image-300x200.jpg" alt="If-its-tuesday-blog-image" width="300" height="200" />From sea to shining sea, the United States is a brilliant array of wide-open skies, wide-open spaces and wide-open opinions. Traveling through this great nation is nothing less than an exciting adventure.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">For all this country’s vast diversity, however, sometimes it all looks the same. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_It%27s_Tuesday%2C_This_Must_Be_Belgium" target="_blank">recent road-trip</a> has allowed me to experience the grandeur of the East and the beautiful states in the Southwest. But two weeks on the road—city to city, town to town, and face-to-face with nameless Wal-mart associates and gas station attendants can make the locations run together.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Sometimes the only difference from one place to the next is the road kill.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">In my home state of Utah, the morning driver can expect a range of overnight roadside animal fatalities. Deer, skunk, cat, and raccoon are famous for not quite making the party on the other side of the road. Less nocturnal gallivanting creatures- dogs, cows (yes, it happens), and pygmy goats are also candidates for a tar-based final resting spot. On trips I have made to Florida I noticed the turtle and occasional snake had bitten the dust. When in Texas, it was the armadillo.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Fact is, there is always a light going out somewhere to the sound of screeching tires.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Over the years, America’s news industry has enjoyed growing pains and lived through reductions in force. Rather than be left roadside, it has changed from hand-written notes to instant global distribution of critical details. But one thing hasn’t changed. The world craves news.<br />
If you’re in the news industry, terms like “adaptation” and “transformation” are on your mind and in your meetings. Publishers know their sustainable pulse relies on a “multidimensional audience-centric business model” and the ability to embrace innovative ideas and put them to work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Understanding the news as a living, breathing and drivable entity is vital to the success of any news vehicle. Knowing to target readers as individuals with varied interests and activities—rather than mere occupants in Zip codes—can make the difference between success and obsolescence. Your audience wants to choose the content that interests them, the products you present to them, and the way you deliver both to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Life as we knew it doesn’t exist anymore. No longer can we sit in the evenings on the front porch swing and read the afternoon edition of the newspaper for all of our news. The world is too fast and too small, and it is our responsibility to create new nostalgia for future generations. So grab your mobile—and post, tweet, like and share.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Drive—let’s face it. We’d rather be behind the wheel than under the tires.</p>

							<p>When shopping for point applications or enterprise software systems, buyers face a familiar dilemma. Best-of-breed or single-source? Is it better to purchase the best components possible and make sure they all work together? Or, is it preferable to work with one supplier who will take responsibility for installing and supporting the entire package? <a class="read-more" href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/one-cheek-to-kiss/">read more</a></p>

							<p>The newspaper mobile-only audience had a 73% growth spurt this year. Almost 40% of online news consumers‎ get content exclusively on mobile devices. Compare this to people who use desktops or laptops to access newspaper content, which dropped to 32%, according to the latest ComScore data reported by the Newspaper Association of America. <a class="read-more" href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/serving-the-mobile-only-al-generation/">read more</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">November 10, 2014</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><a href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Paid-Content-Blog-Image.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5964" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Paid-Content-Blog-Image-300x199.jpg" alt="Paid-Content-Blog-Image" width="300" height="199" /></a>The great digital content debate wages on. Passionate “information wants to be free” apostles are pitted squarely against the pragmatic “we must charge for content in order to survive” proponents. Others straddle the fence with one leg on either side of the paywall, advocating that some digital content should be free while other types of content should be paid for.</p>
<p>This being an election month, we decided to go straight to the populace and listen to the voices in our community. What are newspapers doing today when it comes to charging for online content? We polled 45 global newspaper companies – ranging from local community publishers to metro dailies – and asked their opinions on the polarizing topic of paid versus free content.</p>
<p>Nearly three out of four newspapers surveyed (73%) are currently charging readers to access online content. Almost 40% of these newspapers have deployed a “hard” paywall model. Hard paywalls require readers to have a subscription to access most or all premium digital content. The remaining 60% are using a “soft” or metered paywall model, allowing online visitors to read a certain number of free articles each month before requiring a subscription.</p>
<p>For publishers that have adopted metered paywalls, the number of free articles range from three per day to as many as 12 per month. On average, newspapers in the survey using metered paywalls allow readers to access nine free articles online monthly.</p>
<p>Some publishers have introduced an extra level of granularity into their metered paywalls. One newspaper, for example, allows readers to access ten article pages each month, but permits unlimited views of section fronts and photo galleries. Another newspaper has created different paymeter rules for different digital channels – ten free article views on the website, 25 views on the mobile site, and 50 views on mobile apps each month.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that paywall success is largely dependent on the value of the product to the audiences. “We have to provide content that is not available anywhere else in our community, and is valuable to our readers,” said one publisher. “Then we need to let them know we have it and it is worth paying for. We have to market to non-readers using both social and traditional media to achieve this.”</p>
<p>Retention rates appear to be significantly higher for newspapers that use metered pay models as opposed to hard paywalls. Again, the percentages vary, but most publishers with a hard paywall are reporting retention rates in the 15-20% range. Retention rates for newspapers using a metered paywall average 58.5%, with some reporting as much as 90% reader retention.</p>
<p>Clearly, not every customer is willing to trade increased subscription revenues for potential losses in the ad department. “We took down our paywall because it had a drastic effect on our online advertising revenues,” reported one mid-sized daily newspaper. “We traded every dollar in advertising we lost for a nickel in online subscription revenue. Since we took the paywall down (June 2013), our online impressions have doubled and our online revenue continues to increase by a significant percentage every year. Every market is different, and we are not saying this is the right approach for everyone, but it worked for us.”</p>
<p>Over 62% of the newspapers surveyed are using an outside vendor to implement their paywall solutions, while the remaining 38% have developed their paywalls in-house. When it comes to some of the newer paid content schemes, it is interesting to note that only 25% are currently offering day passes to online readers, and only 22% have implemented a rewards program. Many publishers reported, however, that such initiatives are in the planning stage at their respective newspapers or groups.</p>
<p>When asked for predictions on how paywalls will evolve in the future, one newspaper circulation director said, “I think we will need to move to better digital and interactive versions of our print product that would be subscriber based in addition to our website. Content specific apps (Local Sports Scores for example) may also be in the future.”</p>
<p>Another customer offered a similar viewpoint: “I think paid content is the only way for newspapers to survive unless the print edition is also free. Too many tried free digital while still charging for print with the idea that online ad revenue would be the only necessary revenue source, with mostly disastrous results. Local advertisers outside of the metro areas are reluctant to move to strictly online advertising because web ad sales are still focused almost exclusively on page views instead of click-throughs.”</p>
<p>Finally, although opinions and success rates differ widely on the paid versus free content debate, there is general agreement on the need for integration. One west coast newspaper group said it succinctly: “All channels need to be integrated with the ability to repackage content in ways that are most valuable to the end user and give us the ability to sell packages.” Pointing to the advantage of a single source approach in the future, this publisher echoed a common sentiment: “Our challenge is connecting all platforms to one solution that can also monetize content packages, versus just providing access to our entire news site.”</p>

By Lisa Speth, NEWSCYCLE Solutions Marketing Communications Manager</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">24 October 2014</p>
<p>I’ve discovered that the Big Bad Wolf of childhood fables might have had a heart and an alternate ending for the poor creature. It depends on which version of the story you absorb. Grimm and Aesop portrayed him to be a vicious killer of all things having a red hood or Grandma-esque quality. But, then there is the 2010 movie adaptation titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Riding_Hood_%282011_film%29" target="_blank">Red Riding Hood</a> (spoiler alert) where the BBW at the end isn’t so bad, and as you watch him haunt the woods all alone staring at the girl he will never have, you want a happily-ever-after for him. He has a heart, a soul, and just wants to be loved.</p>
<p>I’m an audience. I’ve found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_%28series%29" target="_blank">vampires</a>, <a href="http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Jacob_Black" target="_blank">werewolves</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">serial killers</a>, and scary aliens quite charming. Some are even loveable. How did that happen? Where did that vulnerability in a killer’s body come from that attracts and keeps me as its audience?</p>
<p>What creates a loyal audience? Why do we go back time after time? Why do we stay? The answer is surprisingly simple. Because we are endeared to them. Someone along the way has (brilliantly) created something we love to love.</p>
<p>I’ve walked out of theaters mid-movie, closed an unfinished book (I mean, put down my Kindle) and hunted for the remote when I couldn’t emotionally connect to a character. There is nothing more frustrating than to look forward to being totally enchanted by my entertainment, and then it not have me at hello.</p>
<p>News media companies are constantly reinventing themselves. They are rebranding to remain competitive, delivering on different formats to build and keep an audience, and engaging advertisers to remain afloat. In the process, they also need to find that core connection with their audience – something that creates the desire to make their website someone’s home page. Something to turn on that’s comfortable, reliable and entertaining, and yet real.</p>
<p>An audience has to believe in who you are and what you are telling them in order for them to stay. They have to totally buy it to not walk out in the middle. An audience needs to be fascinated enough to see how it ends, or to see what’s next. If it’s not there, our fast-food, ADD minds will leave and go elsewhere for our fix. We are selfish creatures of habit and if we can’t find it here, we’ll find it elsewhere.</p>

							<p>The newspaper mobile-only audience had a 73% growth spurt this year. Almost 40% of online news consumers‎ get content exclusively on mobile devices. Compare this to people who use desktops or laptops to access newspaper content, which dropped to 32%, according to the latest ComScore data reported by the Newspaper Association of America. <a class="read-more" href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/serving-the-mobile-only-al-generation/">read more</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">October 14, 2014</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Day-Pass-Blog-Image.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5903" src="http://www.newscyclesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Day-Pass-Blog-Image-300x199.jpg" alt="Day-Pass-Blog-Image" width="300" height="199" /></a>Though digital readership has increased 23% in the last couple of years, only 10% of readers are paying for online content. Day passes sold by media companies may meet audience needs while opening up an untapped source of revenue.</strong></p>
<p>Globally, newspaper digital circulation revenue is up 60% from 2012. Digital readership increased 23% over the same period. At US$1.7 billion, digital circulation revenue represents only a little more than 1% of total newspaper revenue, but the needle continues to move in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Still, there’s a problem. While a growing number of readers are buying digital subscriptions, only about 10% of online users worldwide are actually paying for content.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a commitment thing. Lots of people simply do not want to sign up for long-term digital subscriptions. Or, more commonly, readers find a story online, they want to read it, and then they want to move on to something else.</p>
<p>To meet this challenge – as well to find new ways of enticing even the most casual online readers – newspaper companies around the world are increasingly turning to day passes — one-day subscriptions that provide timed access to online content.</p>
<p>Sold in single-day and multi-day bundles, the day pass concept helps newspapers engage a new genre of readers who are not yet loyal to their brands.</p>
<p>Companies like the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/" target="_blank">Austin (Texas) American-Statesman</a> introduced a US$0.99 day pass less than a year ago, which has helped the media company build the largest digital audience of any local media group in its market.</p>
<p>In Germany, Axel Springer launched an <a href="http://www.bild.de/bild-plus/startseite/bildplus/home-30723544.bild.html" target="_blank">innovative programme called BILDplus</a> that uses ink jet technology to print a unique code on each copy of the newspaper. Readers can enter this code online to get free one-day access to premium BILD content.</p>
<p>According to Axel Springer, “BILDplus supports BILD’s circulation and combines the online and offline worlds.”</p>
<p><strong>At a dollar, pound, or euro for 24-hour access, day passes are easy and inexpensive.</strong> They help media companies lower the entry barrier for people who want content now. No complex registration process. No need to answer any surveys or quiz questions.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.bain.com/Images/BB_Publishing_in_the_digital_era_4_11.pdf" target="_blank">recent study by Bain and Company</a>, even people who are willing to pay for online news say they would spend three times less for digital content than for the printed versions of the product.</p>
<p>For these readers, day passes are carrots instead of sticks. In exchange for a very small payment, readers are rewarded with a day’s worth of valuable content and quality journalism.</p>
<p><strong>So, as newspapers around the world strive to refine and expand their digital revenue models, here are four reasons why day passes should be part of these multi-pronged strategies:</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Digital day passes help build brand loyalty one day at a time.</em> At the recent iConnect Solutions newspaper user group conference in Minneapolis, it was reported that readers who sign up for 24-hour access are more likely to return another day, and even more likely to sign up for longer-term access (e.g. multi-day passes or short-term subscriptions) on subsequent visits.</p>
<p><em>2. Day passes enable newspapers to capture information about readers that proves valuable in audience segmentation and targeting efforts.</em> Even minimal registration data helps to remove the anonymity of casual visitors, which in turn allows the newspaper to serve up more contextually relevant news and advertising content.</p>
<p>Relevant content leads to greater engagement and an increased likelihood that one-time readers will commit to becoming subscribers. More carrots, fewer sticks.</p>
<p><em>3. People, young and old, are accustomed to paying a little bit of money online for a song, an app, or a movie.</em> Day passes extend this paradigm to news site content.</p>
<p>As long as the payment process follows the simplicity of a music or app store, readers will be encouraged to sign up for digital day passes with minimal effort and forethought.</p>
<p><em>4. Day passes cater to the immediacy of mobile audiences. </em>Mobile users, especially those who come to a newspaper’s site through search, want their content right now.</p>
<p>A simple day pass coupled with a built-in mobile payment scheme allows a media company to make a valuable connection with mobile users that can lead to greater engagement and long-term loyalty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In places like the United Kingdom, where 20% of all newspaper readers use mobile devices exclusively to access content, this is a growing audience segment to be captured, cultivated, and nurtured.</p>
<p>As global newspaper companies head into the final quarter of this year and look forward to 2015, the digital pay pass is one more arrow in the quiver to help keep circulation revenues on the rise, and to successfully convince and convert a new segment of online audiences into becoming loyal subscribers.</p>
