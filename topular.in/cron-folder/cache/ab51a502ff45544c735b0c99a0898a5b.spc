<p>Congress returns to work today after the Fourth of July recess, with a student-loan fix near the top of the to-do list.</p>

<p>Interest rates on government-subsidized Stafford loans doubled last week to 6.8%, after the Senate rejected two competing proposals for keeping the rate down: a Republican bill to link Stafford rates to the rate on 10-year Treasury notes, and a two-year extension of the 3.4% rate which expired last week.</p>
<p>Modified versions of those proposals are back on the table this week. Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly (D) says he's open to both ideas, but says Congress must act to bring the rate down.</p>
<p align="left">House Republicans have passed a bill tying student loans to market rates. Donnelly voted to block Senate Republicans' version last month. He says it left out a key element of the House bill: a ceiling on how high the rate could go.</p>
<p align="left">Other Democrats, including President Obama,&nbsp;contend the House bill's cap is too high.</p>
<p align="left">Subsidized Stafford loans account for about a quarter of government-sponsored student loans. A 2007 law reduced the interest rate over four years to 3.4%. Congress agreed last year to postpone the lower rate's expiration for a year. Michigan Senator Debbie Stabenow has proposed a second one-year extension to give Congress time to agree on broader reform.</p>
<p align="left">West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has offered his own version of a Treasury-linked rate, with tripartisan support from Manchin, a trio of Republican senators, and Maine Independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats. But it, too, is missing the cap Senate Democratic leaders say is essential.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1998667";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1998667";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 09:00:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"By Eric Berman - eric@wibc.com | @WIBC_Eric Berman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"Who&#039;s a Good Boy?

<p>Dog lovers give Indianapolis high marks as a pet-friendly city.</p>

<p>A travel website this year ranked Indy the fifth-best city in America for travelers with pets, based on the number of pet-friendly hotels, dog parks, and overall walkability. Le Ann Robertson travels the state for her work with the bull-terrier advocacy group Bully Buddys, and says there's been a noticeable increase statewide in the number of hotels reaching out to accommodate pet owners.</p>
<p>Jess Kinner, who runs the <a href="http://www.wibc.com/dogfriendlyindy.com" target="_blank">dogfriendlyindy.com</a> blog, would use different criteria, but says Indy still stacks up well. She says there's a growing number of the dog-related events for which she began the blog. And while some locations explicitly ban dogs from outdoor cafes, Kinner says a large number of Indy restaurants expressly cater to dog owners -- an important consideration when you're walking your dog and want something to eat.</p>
<p>Robertson says Indy deserves bonus points for its progress toward no-kill shelters and increased spaying and neutering.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1998750";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1998750";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 09:00:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"By Eric Berman - eric@wibc.com | @WIBC_Eric Berman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"Past College-to-NBA Coaches Are a Cautionary Tale for Stevens";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2355:"<p><img src="http://www.wibc.com/Pics/news/sports/brad_stevens_celtics_RTV6_070513.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="284" /><br /><em>(photo courtesy RTV6)</em></p>
<p>New Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens will be just the 24th NBA head coach with no experience as a player, assistant coach or executive with a pro team.</p>
<p>Four of the 20 winningest coaches in NBA history made the jump directly from college to&nbsp;the pros. Bill Fitch and Dick Motta won championships to go with more than 900 career victories, and New Albany native John MacLeod won 707 games in an 18-year career after leaving the University of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>But the list also includes Long Island University's Roy Rubin, whose 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers managed just nine wins, a futility record that stood for 39 years. Rubin was fired with a record of 4-47. Three other college-to-pro coaches&rsquo; winning percentages rank among the 20 worst, among coaches who lasted at least 20 games.</p>
<p>As a group, the 23 coaches posted career winning percentages of .405, and first-season percentages of .393 -- the equivalent of a 32-50 season. The coaches actually averaged 27 wins in their first year, primarily because of coaches like Rubin and the San Antonio Spurs' Jerry Tarkanian, who got fired in midseason before even&nbsp;reaching double digits in wins.</p>
<p>Pacers play-by-play man Mark Boyle says every case is different -- how a coach does depends on his support from ownership, the quality of his assistants, the owners' willingness to be patient, and the coach's recognition of the differences between the college and pro game.</p>
<p>And Boyle and Indiana Sportstalk host Bob Lovell note most college coaches who make the jump have one handicap in common: their players aren't very good. The rebuilding Celtics are expected to continue that trend.</p>
<p>But both say Stevens' temperament is likely to eliminate one pitfall, by earning the players' respect. Boyle says it's impossible to imagine Stevens coming in and acting like he has nothing to learn. Lovell says Stevens' record of success at Butler will precede him.</p>
<p>Stevens is the first NBA head coach with no pro experience since 2004, when the Golden State Warriors hired Mike Montgomery away from Stanford. Montgomery returned to the Pac-10 after posting back-to-back 34-48 records in the NBA.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1999526";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1999526";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 07 Jul 2013 09:00:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"By Eric Berman - eric@wibc.com | @WIBC_Eric Berman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"Brandon Miller to be Bulldogs Head Basketball Coach";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1405:"<p align="left"><img src="http://www.wibc.com/Pics/news/450_2013b/miller%20butler%20coach.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="281" /><br /><em>(photo courtesy of butlersports.com)</em></p>
<p align="left">The Butler Bulldogs have a new head basketball coach.</p>
<p align="left">It didn't take long for Butler University Vice President and Director of Athletics Barry Collierto identify Brandon Miller as the next head coach of the basketball program.</p>
<p align="left">Miller was hired by Brad Stevens in April to be an assistant coach for the Bulldogs. Miller, a 2003 Butler grad, work for the Bulldogs previously in their 2007-2008 season. He left Butler go to Ohio State where he stayed for six years. Last season he was an assistant coach at the University of Illinois before coming back to his alma mater earlier this spring.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">"I am confident that Brandon will carry on the Butler University basketball tradition of excellence, especially as we make the transition to the Big East Athletic Conference," said Collier. "With Brandon's leadership, Butler is well positioned to expand upon the success of the last few years."</p>
<p align="left">A native of New Castle, Miller earned a bachelor's degree from Butler in 2003. His appointment as head basketball coach is effective immediately.</p>

<p><strong></strong>While the national unemployment rate remained 7.6 percent in June as it was the previous month, Mike Hicks of Ball State's Center for Business and Economic Research says all of the job growth was in part-time employment.&nbsp; The jobs report showed that there were 240,000 fewer full-time jobs in June than in May, which Hicks says means a lot of jobs were generated that will likely disappear once summer is over.<br /><br />Hicks believes the rapid growth in part-time employment versus full-time jobs is one reason the Obama administration announced that it was delaying by one year the Affordable Care Act mandate that employers provide insurance to employees working 30 hours per week or more.&nbsp; He says the delay will likely not cause businesses who had already cut the hours of their workers to reverse course, since the mandate is still the law. &nbsp;<br /><br />The long term problem with the jobs market, according to Hicks, is a mismatch of the skills people have with those needed by businesses in the modern economy.&nbsp; While the number of people actively seeking work increased last month, Hicks says labor force participation is at levels not seen since the late 1970's, which means the unemployment rate is not likely to drop significantly anytime soon.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1999640";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1999640";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sat, 06 Jul 2013 09:00:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"by Ray Steele - rsteele@wibc.com | @WIBC_RaySteele";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"Sheriff&#039;s Deputy Fired After Fourth of July DWI Arrest";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:747:"<p><img src="http://www.wibc.com/Pics/news/450_2013b/jones_allen_IMPD_070513.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="284" /><br /><strong>Alan Jones </strong><em>(photo courtesy IMPD)</em></p>

<p>A child is in critical condition at Riley Hospital after a dog attack on the city's east side Friday afternoon.<br /><br />IMPD Lt. Chris Bailey says the attack happened around 4:00 in the 200 block of Tacoma Avenue, near Washington &amp; Rural Streets.&nbsp; Bailey says the 12-year-old boy was attacked by a pit bull belonging to her mother's boyfriend.&nbsp; He was severely bitten on the arm, back and leg.&nbsp; The boy was taken to Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, reportedly in critical condition.<br /><br />Bailey says a neighbor ran over and shot the dog six times, killing the dog.&nbsp; The dog's owner, Keith Phillips, was cited by Indianapolis Animal Care and Control for the attack, for not having the dog up to date on rabies and other unspecified issues. He was also cited in 2012 but IACC says that was for an incident involving a different dog.<br /><br />Phillips will appear in court August 12.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1999529";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.wibc.com/news/story.aspx?ID=1999529";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 05 Jul 2013 21:27:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"By Alex Brown - alex@wibc.com | @WIBC_AlexBrown";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:14:"content-length";s:5:"20073";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=utf-8";s:6:"server";s:17:"Microsoft-IIS/7.5";s:16:"x-aspnet-version";s:9:"4.0.30319";s:12:"x-powered-by";s:7:"ASP.NET";s:10:"servername";s:3:"W1B";s:13:"cache-control";s:18:"public, max-age=10";s:7:"expires";s:29:"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 17:49:20 GMT";s:4:"date";s:29:"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 17:49:10 GMT";s:10:"connection";s:10:"keep-alive";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130503172849";}
