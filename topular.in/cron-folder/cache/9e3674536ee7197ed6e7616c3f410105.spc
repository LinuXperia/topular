<p>You have either been to the Indy 500 or you have not. And until you&#8217;ve been you can&#8217;t fully comprehend the sights, and the smells, and how witnessing such an event changes every other sporting event or mention of car racing forever.</p>
<p>When I talk about my assault I talk about it in the same sense as calling the Indy 500 &#8216;just a car race.&#8217; It&#8217;s safer that way. It keeps all the little things that happened, that hurt, in a safe little bubble where they can&#8217;t be reached.  Details like the door opening from the right or the sharp buzzing pain I felt when he cracked my head against the wall don&#8217;t come rushing back when I tell my version of the story. Basically I took all the awful parts, boxed them up and locked them away three levels deep where I could pretend they didn&#8217;t actually exist and hope they would just disappear.</p>

<p>I started listening to Tori Amos again for the first time in over 15 years. Tori was my life in high school, and if you would have told me that I would remember every single word from Under the Pink after not hearing the album for 15 years I would have thought you were crazy. But I do remember. I don&#8217;t know where I stored that information with everything that has gone on, but I remember. And in remembering the words I remember the life events that surrounded my obsession with Tori Amos. My favorite sweater, the boy who broke my heart, what it felt like driving my first car up Emigration Canyon with the windows down and nowhere to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in therapy. And the person I&#8217;m working with is easily the reincarnation of every good and loving thing that has ever existed in my life, brought together to help work through everything that happened and everything I have tried to stuff down and ignore.</p>
<p>It hurts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s scary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather not.</p>
<p>I was doing a really good job of ignoring it.</p>
<p>She said I had a magnificent gift of self preservation. That I was really good at putting up walls, defenses and coping mechanisms in place to protect myself. I said &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; she replied &#8220;It&#8217;s not a compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>She explained my assault happened in a space and time where I had no defenses, no walls, no protection, no choice and that&#8217;s also where my recovery needs to happen as well. Not from the safe place I&#8217;ve created for myself since then.</p>
<p>Ugh. She&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Just the thought of going back makes me nauseous. Blergh.</p>
<p>But it has to happen.<a href="http://marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?w=81012251&#038;u=hoosiersformaddie&#038;bt=2"><img src="http://marchforbabies.org/getsig/81012251h.jpg" border=0 /></a></p>

<p>If someone needs something, and I have a something that I don&#8217;t particularly need or use? I&#8217;m happy to hand over that something. It&#8217;s easy for me. I like doing it. It&#8217;s just a thing I do. It&#8217;s not a big deal. (It&#8217;s kind of how society should work, isn&#8217;t it?) </p>
<p>At my peak of helping others was also the peak of my mental health. I WAS SOOOO GOOD! Just sailing along with little trips here and there. </p>
<p>Well, surprise! After last year helping people became hard. I still tried to do it, but I never bothered to take care of myself first so helping others simply exhausted me. What&#8217;s worse is it took away from what I was able to give my family as well. You&#8217;ve probably heard the announcement on airplanes &#8220;Put your own oxygen mask on before helping others?&#8221; Same applies to life in general. It&#8217;s not selfish, it&#8217;s common sense. </p>
<p>I also began to pull away from emotionally difficult relationships. I certainly didn&#8217;t need anyone else making me feel worse, I&#8217;m perfectly capable of making myself feel like garbage, thanks! Slowly things started to improve and with therapy I can actually feel the old me begin to bubble up. Several people have already mentioned how much happier I seem, and that means an awful lot to me. </p>
<p>This is where things get tricky. Pieces of the old me <em>are</em> starting to show up. I <em>am</em> happier. But I am still not strong enough to wade in the emotional struggles of others.  <a href="http://themindunleashed.org/2013/10/30-traits-of-empath.html" target="_blank">I am an empath</a>. Always have been. Addie is one as well. For the last year I have actually hated being an empath because it has made me such a delicious target to awful people throughout my life. Being an empath isn&#8217;t a bad thing, but right now I really need to take care of myself so I&#8217;ve learned if I can&#8217;t improve a situation with a sandwich? Sorry, I&#8217;m out. </p>

<p>The good news is I can fix a lot of things for a lot of different people with a sandwich.  So can you. There&#8217;s thousands of different sandwiches for thousands of different situations, and I&#8217;m happy to provide whatever sandwich is needed when I&#8217;m available.</p>
<p><a title="Pastrami sandwich from Shapiro's deli in Indianapolis. Even better than it looks. Promise." href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mooshinindy/3866550524/" data-flickr-embed="true"><img alt="Pastrami sandwich from Shapiro's deli in Indianapolis. Even better than it looks.

<p>So if you&#8217;re an empath, or a giver, or a helper, or a doer, but it is really in your best interest to take care of yourself right now? Ask yourself if a situation can be improved with a sandwich. Sandwiches mean a lot to people. (So do cheeseburgers, burritos, gyros, and falafel.) If it&#8217;s not a situation that can be improved in any way with any form of sandwich? Maybe step away. </p>

<p>Maybe have a sandwich yourself.<a href="http://marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?w=81012251&#038;u=hoosiersformaddie&#038;bt=2"><img src="http://marchforbabies.org/getsig/81012251h.jpg" border=0 /></a></p>

I&#8217;ve come a long way in overcoming &#8220;the act&#8221; (referring to the actual physical assault) because it was physical,<strong> it was a thing that happened and it was a thing that ended.</strong> Much like a car accident, there&#8217;s the actual crash and in a matter of seconds the crash itself is over but in those few seconds your life can be changed forever.</p>
<p>You can even walk away from a car crash physically fine and those who love you will breathe a sigh of relief that you&#8217;re okay, but what isn&#8217;t taken into account (and sometimes not even realized by you until much later) is that you&#8217;re now scared to drive, you avoid certain scenarios, the sound of an accident can set off a whole set of anxious feelings and upset. They&#8217;re all triggers, and they all deserved to be recognized — the problem is unless someone else has also been in an accident most people won&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re going through. &#8220;You&#8217;re fine! You lived! What do  you mean you don&#8217;t want to drive on snowy roads at night?&#8221; Obviously you can&#8217;t avoid snowy roads at night forever, but there will be a time when winter driving will be harder on you.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s all the emotional stuff that surrounds the act that is hard.</strong></p>
<p>The shame, the embarrassment, the guilt. <strong>It&#8217;s gross and I hate it.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t tell Cody for over a year. I didn&#8217;t want him to think of me differently, or worse find out that he thought it was my fault and blame me for what happened.</p>
<p>Was it the right thing to do? Probably not, but you go ahead and watch any Shonda Rhimes show and point out a single time when her characters act in a completely logical way after something goes wrong. (I realize my life is not How To Get Away With Murder or Scandal, but it&#8217;s real easy to sit on a couch and holler <strong>&#8220;WHY DIDN&#8217;T YOU JUST ACT NORMAL?&#8221;</strong> when it&#8217;s not your life.)</p>
<p>The specifics of what happened to me have their own category on hardcore or &#8220;dark&#8221; porn sites<strong>. The thing that broke me is titillating to many. What has been my nightmare for a long time is a fantasy of others.</strong> That&#8217;s a very strange dichotomy to work through in the sexually saturated world we currently live in.<a href="http://marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?w=81012251&#038;u=hoosiersformaddie&#038;bt=2"><img src="http://marchforbabies.org/getsig/81012251h.jpg" border=0 /></a></p>

<p>The first is managing to make yourself so busy with so many other things, people, activities, and distractions that you simply don&#8217;t have time to think about anything else but running away from what happened. Hoping the pain will just fade or go away the busier you stay. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people go on to do great and creative things while running away from terrible pasts, the problem is when they are alone or still for too long everything comes crashing down a hundred times worse.</p>
<p>The second is quite the opposite, and it is the one I have been stuck in for over a year.</p>
<p>I went into hiding.</p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t leave the house or interact with anyone I couldn&#8217;t get hurt again. No one would be able to get close to me. I wouldn&#8217;t have to be vulnerable or feel scared or ever wonder if it will happen again. I once trusted people, a lot. I was kind and outgoing and was always the one championing the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>I used to go out in bright colors with my face towards the sun.</p>
<p>Now I go out fully covered with my eyes down so I don&#8217;t have triggers, flashbacks or worse — see him. Or someone that looks like him. Or someone who knows him. Or something that reminds me of him.</p>
<p>I stay quiet so I don&#8217;t draw attention to myself.</p>
<p>People have told me that by staying quiet and locked away I&#8217;m letting him win. That the best thing I could possibly do is pick myself up and become even stronger than before as a proverbial middle finger to him and what he did to me.</p>
<p>You will either understand this or you won&#8217;t — the idea of building myself back up gives me the same sense of dread as threatening to drop me in the middle of the ocean without so much as a life preserver.</p>
<p>My insides have been nothing but a knot of anxiety, fear, and sadness for over a year. I don&#8217;t remember the last time I was truly happy for any extended period of time.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say this because I want sympathy, and the truth is I am trying to get better.</p>
<p>In fact, I am fighting like hell and I&#8217;m fucking exhausted.</p>
<p>I say this because I never thought I would be here. That I would be so damaged from the actions of another that I would consider myself completely broken. A pile of pieces slugging through a life I once knew and only participate in out of habit.<a href="http://marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?w=81012251&#038;u=hoosiersformaddie&#038;bt=2"><img src="http://marchforbabies.org/getsig/81012251h.jpg" border=0 /></a></p>

<p>What has been worse for me than the physical trauma of the act has been the <em>deep</em> psychological damage. The best way I have been able to describe it to anyone is that an electric mixer was put to my brain and instead of a smooth, solid brain with wiggles and curves I have what resembles a pile of burnt scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t tell Cody  about what happened until a few months ago. Together we began telling those closest to us and responses ranged from &#8220;You need to go back to church and pray harder&#8221; to complete apathy, like I should be over it already. For anyone who has ever been through rape or sexual assault, you&#8217;ll know victim shaming and blaming is a very real thing and the reason so many people stay quiet.</p>
<p>So now those of you who have been around for awhile know why I broke, and why I didn&#8217;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be an uplifting voice for violence against women. I don&#8217;t want to be some hero survivor inspiration story.</p>
<p>I just want my fucking life back.</p>

<p>Many good people have stuck by me. New friends claim I&#8217;m perfect the way I am and that they are honored to know me now, as someone who has gone through shit and still standing.</p>
<p>The issue is while I am standing I have done nothing more than merely exist for a very long time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to explain what happened, as so many little things hurt me and imperceptibly molded me into a version of myself I don&#8217;t recognize — or have at least caused me to forget what I used to be like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as though I&#8217;ve collapsed around my heart, fiercely protecting it from everyone and everything because I simply do not trust anyone else with it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re here looking for the old me, know that I&#8217;m looking for her too. In the process I hope to take better care of who I am now, so I can nurture her back to being the optimistic, witty, laugh-hard, love-harder version of myself Cody fell in love with years ago.  And maybe I can learn to let people in again. And maybe help someone who has lost themselves as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrible feeling, losing oneself and trying to start over before all the rubble has been cleared.</p>
<p>I know writing has always been a part of me, and hopefully by bringing it back it will serve as breadcrumbs for the rest of me to follow.</p>

<p>Oh, hello. You&#8217;re still here? Bless you.</p>
<p>The past few months have been tricky. Not particularly hard but very hard to put into words.</p>
<p>Vivi will most likely grow up to become either a serial killer or the next Ke$sha, regardless, there is a freezer full of glittery dead hobos in her future.</p>
<p>Addie? Well. Addie had a really rough August. She has started to show signs of chemical depression and anxiety and it hurts me more than I can even comprehend to know this may be a struggle she faces for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Cody is hunky as ever with his big strong man hands and fear of bugs.</p>
<p>Me? I&#8217;m okay. I really am.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be back here. I want to be back here.</p>
<p>This is the first step to doing just that.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not until I&#8217;m sick that I realize every living breathing human around me is leaving behind DNA, mucous, air, and germs everywhere they go. I begin to wonder &#8220;How did I get sick? Was it that dollar bill I found on the ground? Was it from hugging my friend that had &#8216;allergies&#8217;? HOW DO I KEEP ALL THESE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE FROM GETTING SICK TOO?&#8221; It&#8217;s terrible. I go from not caring to OCD-hand-washing-ninja in under a minute.</p>
<p><span id="more-6882"></span></p>
<p>I skipped my flu shot this year, not on purpose, but because things like putting off a flu shot happen. Then I got the flu. On Christmas. Then Cody got the flu and Vivi got the flu and Addie got something else. We called it Flumas and I was so, so sad. Had we just gotten our flu shots we would have all been so much better so much faster.</p>
<p>No more putting off flu shots.</p>
<p>This is where things get serious, a friend&#8217;s baby was once hospitalized with whooping cough at 6 months old. I visited her in the hospital and you want to know what will knock the air out of any parents&#8217; lungs? Seeing a 6 month old baby in a hospital bed. Want to know how you could keep a baby out of a hospital bed? Getting a whooping cough vaccine.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to suffer the consequences of skipping your own flu shot and ending up in bed miserable and uncomfortable. It&#8217;s another thing entirely to skip a whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine and be the reason a little baby and his or her parents have to spend time in the hospital.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any time around a sick baby then you KNOW how scary coughing is for little bodies. I have a fully grown body and I once fractured a rib coughing. One shot could not only save you from the whooping cough, but it could protect the babies around you as well (this includes your grandbabies, grandparents!)</p>
<p>I used to roll my eyes at my step-mom, a long-time nurse in the NICU. She wouldn&#8217;t let herself come near my girls if she hadn&#8217;t had her flu shot, or if she had any sniffles at all. She was always overprotective and the first one shouting &#8220;GET YOUR VACCINES!&#8221; from the rooftops. I get it now. Sorry for thinking you were kind of crazy, Colleen.</p>
<p>The good news. You can get a whooping cough vaccine at any Walgreens location <i>whenever</i> the pharmacy is open and whenever you get a shot at Walgreens you’ll help provide a lifesaving vaccine to a child in need through the Get a Shot. Give a Shot.® program, a partnership between Walgreens and the UN Foundation’s Shot@Life campaign.</p>
<p>Get your shot, grab yourself a snack from the candy aisle at Walgreens (my favorite candy aisle) and know you helped get a life-saving vaccine to a kid in need and helped keep yourself and the babies around you healthy and safe. Deal? Deal.</p>
<p><em>*Donation currently valid for non-flu vaccinations. Aggregate donation of up to $1 million. Vaccines subject to availability. State-, age- and health-related restrictions may apply. </em></p>
<p><em>(My love for Walgreens has always been pure and true. My dedication to shots? I&#8217;m working on it. I know it&#8217;s a weird topic, but it&#8217;s one that is vitally and personally important to me. Thanks for listening.)</em><a href="http://marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?w=81012251&#038;u=hoosiersformaddie&#038;bt=2"><img src="http://marchforbabies.org/getsig/81012251h.jpg" border=0 /></a></p>

<p>In the early haze of new motherhood I was overwhelmed with guilt over not being able to breastfeed. While the two mammary glands attached to my chest look promising, the truth is they are milk duds. For whatever reason mine simply don’t work despite every reasonable effort I made to become the sole food provider for both of my babies. I would plan feedings so I wouldn’t have to pull a bottle out in public. The shame I felt whenever I mixed formula in front of a breastfeeding mom was overwhelming. I always felt like I had to justify myself, tell everyone how hard I tried because I was absolutely sure everyone was judging me.</p>
<p>Turns out I’m the only one who really cared.</p>
<p>You want to know how often I worry about breastfeeding now?</p>
<p>Exactly never.</p>
<p>You want to know how much guilt I’ve felt over the last ten years for not being able to breastfeed?</p>
<p>Exactly none.</p>
<p><a title="my baby and me. by Casey Mullins, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mooshinindy/6409236529"><img class="aligncenter" alt="my baby and me." src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/7/6215/6409236529_90ed54d001_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>The only time I even think about breastfeeding anymore is when Addie brings home a 100% on some test she didn’t even study for. Back in 2004 a few hard core lactivists made me believe that if I didn’t exclusively breastfeed Addie, her health and intelligence would be forever compromised. Yet every time Addie dazzles me yet again with her smarts and kindness I want to hold her up like Simba on Pride Rock and yell “LOOK! IT DIDN’T MATTER HOW I FED HER! SHE’S WONDERFUL!” to all the mothers struggling with their own decisions on how to best feed their babies.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Vivi told me she hated me. Last week she found a tube of lipstick and finger-painted an entire wall bright pink. The last two mornings she has located a permanent marker and colored her entire body blue, as well as written her name on several walls. Someone needs to tell her if she’s going to commit such heinous acts she shouldn’t sign her name or leave evidence all over her own body. I have a hard time believing she’d be any less of a toad had her milk come from my body and not a can.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’ve learned about kids — some days they will eat Brussels sprouts, quinoa, and kale without complaint. Other days the only nourishment you will be able to coerce into their little bodies consists of grape skins and a handful of marshmallows. Some days they will be obedient little angels and other days it’s as though hellfire is pouring forth from every pore of their being. Some days they will get along with their siblings from sunup to sundown while other days you will feel like a referee at a bare knuckled boxing match.</p>
<p>It’s not like you didn’t try.</p>
<p>You’re just working with what you’ve been given. We all are. As long as we&#8217;re all doing the best we can each day (and some days are better than others), nothing we deal with is a direct result of what we fed our babies on the day they were born or how we have loved them every day up until now.</p>

Growing up, I believed my mom was invincible. She always had the best clothes, the best hair, the best lipstick, an answer for everything, and was the prettiest mom anyone had ever had. As I grew into my teenage years however, I was convinced I had the most strict, most hands-off mom of every single one of my friends. While their moms would bring them forgotten lunches or pick them up from school if it was raining — my mom was working full time to support herself, my sister, and me. If I wanted to go to a friend&#8217;s house, I walked there and found my own way home. If I wanted to take dance lessons, I learned the bus route. If I forgot my lunch? I went hungry. If I didn&#8217;t do my homework? It was my own fault.</p>
<p><a title="The Old Days by Casey Mullins, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mooshinindy/9257267485"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Old Days" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/9257267485_95608f0063_z.jpg" width="640" height="502" /></a></p>
<p>When I see all these reports of moms being arrested or charged with neglect for letting their kids go out into the world unattended, I think back to the way my mom raised me (she would have gone to jail FOR SURE.) But guess what? I&#8217;m fine. And you know what else? Public transit doesn&#8217;t scare me. I&#8217;m okay traveling by myself. If I don&#8217;t know how to do something I figure it out. Plop me down in the middle of nowhere with a map and I could find my way home. Even though my mom never had warm cookies waiting for me when I got home — she raised me to be self-reliant.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m a mom with a school-aged child I realize that perhaps her end goal wasn&#8217;t to raise us to be self-reliant human beings (although I&#8217;m certain that factored into things.) I have to believe a lot of the parenting she did was simply single parent survival. She couldn&#8217;t risk her job to bring me a forgotten permission slip. She didn&#8217;t have several hours a day to drive my sister and me around to various houses, classes, and lessons. I don&#8217;t doubt that she could have run herself ragged trying to keep all of our loose ends in check as well as her own, but she didn&#8217;t. She knew her own sanity was just as important as her children&#8217;s happiness. That&#8217;s something many modern day mothers seem to have forgotten, to take care of themselves first.</p>
<p>I still go back and forth with a little anger, jealousy, and resentment that she wasn&#8217;t June Cleaver. But knowing myself the way I do now, I would have turned out terribly had she not thrown us from the nest with complete faith we could fly (or at least figure it out on the way down.) My relationship with my mom is not one of flowery and scripted sentiment, it is one of deep appreciation for what she did with what she was given. Just as I had no idea how to navigate being a teenager, she was never handed a manual on how to parent one. It was both our first and last time being in those roles and we crashed and burned, hard and often.</p>
<p><a title="Eastern Caribbean Instagram Cruise, July 2013 by Casey Mullins, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mooshinindy/9396260929"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Eastern Caribbean Instagram Cruise, July 2013" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2860/9396260929_7ce37679e9_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>I already have moments when I know the best thing to do for my girls is shove from the proverbial nest and let them fly. It&#8217;s hard, but I know it will be worth it. My sister and I are good. I do however try to work a plate of warm cookies in here and there, but when I look back at the way my mom raised me — it&#8217;s not a bad way to raise good humans.</p>
<p><a title="rock on. by Casey Mullins, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mooshinindy/3119128332"><img class="aligncenter" alt="rock on." src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3078/3119128332_15aa994fcc_z.jpg?zz=1" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s really all we can do as parents — take what our parents did, brush off the ugly parts and hopefully recycle them for the greater good in our own children.</p>
<p>Several years ago I realized my mom and I are in a place where we can be friends. I don&#8217;t rely on her for anything, while she is still young and spry enough to enjoy life on her own. Perhaps someday the roles will be reversed, and I will find myself in the caregiver role — but for now my mom can be my friend. Something we know as parents we cannot do through certain life stages (and I assure you, my mom never tried to be my friend. Protector, provider, parent? Yes. Friend? Absolutely not.) I am able to continually learn from her, and hopefully she is able to relish in her grandchildren and the knowledge that my sister and I are happy.</p>
<p>So mom? You are one of my longest relationships, but one of my newest friendships. The love I have for you is deep and inexplicable. Even on the days I want to scream and yell that I turned out just like you, I want to thank you for giving me something so real to model myself around as a mother. I only get one biological mom, and I&#8217;m pretty glad you&#8217;re mine.</p>
