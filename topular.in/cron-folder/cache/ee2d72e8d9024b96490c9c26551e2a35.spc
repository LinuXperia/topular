<p>TIGER is small compared to other federal programs, but it has quickly become an important source of funding for projects like the Indianapolis Cultural Trail or Tampa&#8217;s Riverwalk that would have a hard time getting support from highway-centric pots of money. Every cycle, U.S. DOT is <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2010/09/27/applications-for-tiger-ii-funding-overwhelm-what-u-s-dot-can-dish-out/" target="_blank">overwhelmed</a> with applications.</p>
<p>However, the future of TIGER is far from certain, writes Stephen Lee Davis at <a href="http://t4america.org/2016/02/23/though-congress-passed-a-transportation-bill-funding-for-key-programs-still-up-in-the-air/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+transportationforamerica+%28Transportation+For+America+%28All%29%29" target="_blank">Transportation for America</a>. T4A is urging TIGER supporters to contact senators about continuing the program:</p>
<blockquote><p>The TIGER competitive grant program is one of the few ways that local communities of almost any size can directly receive federal dollars for their priority transportation projects. Unlike the overwhelming majority of all federal transportation dollars that are awarded via formulas to ensure that everyone gets a share, regardless of how they plan to spend it, TIGER projects compete against each other and are selected on their merits to ensure that each dollar is spent in the most effective way possible.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-328334"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>This competition spurs innovation, leverages federal funding by matching it with greater local dollars and awards funding to projects that provide a high return on investment. Choosing projects based on their potential benefits is exactly the direction that transportation spending needs to move in, and we need to ensure that this vital program continues.</p>
<p>Because TIGER was not even <em>authorized</em> in the <a href="http://t4america.org/2015/12/02/think-fast-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-congress-new-five-year-transportation-bill/">five-year FAST Act</a> and therefore wholly lacks any certainty of funding, congressional appropriators play an incredibly important role in deciding once again how much funding to provide for TIGER (and other key transportation programs) in the coming year. We want to ensure that the Senate’s key committee begins the process by providing <strong>at least</strong> the full $500 million they’ve provided in the past.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Members of Congress need to hear from you today. Do you represent a city, county, metro planning organization, or other group? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gQJ7GbnZx5oiPlYo1bmP5pTN8tuxW1nWnSY9M9NLyoc/viewform">We’re looking for these sorts of groups to sign a letter</a> to the Senate Appropriations Committee in support of these programs. <em>(We are not targeting individual letters at this time.)</em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s time for another caption contest! This oddly placed bench at the intersection of Patton Avenue (US74) and Florida Avenue in Asheville, North Carolina, offers the kind of view only a traffic engineer could love, and probably very few have stuck around long enough to find out.</p>
<p>Ashville-based planner Don Kostelec offers a better look at this insanely dangerous intersection in this <a href="https://youtu.be/zoWgPf3of9c" target="_blank">Youtube video</a>. No crosswalks, no pedestrian crossing signals, just a whole lot of fast moving traffic and this inviting bench.</p>
<p>We already have a couple of contenders:</p>

<p>The California High-Speed Rail Authority says it will shift gears by building the first operational section of the bullet train from the Central Valley to San Jose rather than going to Burbank first, as initially planned. Trains would share the Caltrain tracks from San Jose to downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>According to the Authority&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hsr.ca.gov/about/business_plans/draft_2016_Business_Plan.html">official statement</a>, “The first objective is to initiate high-speed rail passenger service as soon as possible in order to bring benefits to California and generate revenues to attract private sector participation. With existing funding and more than 100 miles of active construction in the Central Valley already underway, the Authority will complete the construction of the high-speed rail line between Silicon Valley and Central Valley by 2024, with operations beginning in 2025.”</p>
<p>As always happens when there is an adjustment, the change drew long-term High-Speed Rail opponents right back out, and they wasted no time lambasting the project with the same misinformation they&#8217;ve sowed from before 2008, when voters authorized HSR. Jim Patterson, Republican Assemblyman representing parts of Fresno and Tulare Counties, in an interview on <a href="http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201602230900">KQED&#8217;s Forum</a>, said the change is a tacit admission that the Authority can&#8217;t find the money to go south through the Tehachipies. &#8220;This is not the High Speed Rail plan that the voters approved,&#8221; he said. Predictably, he called for a re-vote, since the &#8220;design that the authority is building is so different and so at odds with what the people approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense. Anybody can Google the project maps and see that the plan is still exactly what the voters approved. And they approved it because they realized as the state grows and pollution and environmental problems get worse, it&#8217;s idiotic to just <a href="http://la.streetsblog.org/2015/05/05/for-goodness-sake-stop-widening-the-405/">keep widening roads</a>, since we know that doesn&#8217;t work. A fast train between the northern and southern parts of the state is the solution, as anyone who travels overseas already knows.<br />
<span id="more-328255"></span><br />
Yes, the costs have varied. There&#8217;s simply no way to build a 400-mile system across the diverse terrain of California without adjusting to the discovered realities on the ground; not to mention the ever changing politics and finances, which changes the construction timeline and with it, the costs. It is not credible that the voters of California didn&#8217;t grasp that when they approved the project&#8211;especially since the Proposition stated that the legislature would have to look at the finances and give final approval. That happened in 2012, after a vigorous debate in legislative committee and on the floor of the Assembly and State Senate.</p>
<p>There are other bits of misinformation that opponents throw out, ad nauseam. For example, despite what the critics say, there&#8217;s a very good reason to route HSR to the Bay Area from Los Angeles via the Central Valley and Palmdale, rather than straight up the Grapevine and the I-5 alignment&#8211;there&#8217;s a second project, called <a href="http://www.xpresswest.com/">Express West</a> that will connect the system at Palmdale to Las Vegas. Obviously, a 15 minute addition to the travel time from LA to SF is worth it if it also connects the entire system to Las Vegas. Even someone who thinks Bakerfield, Fresno and the other cities of the Central Valley aren&#8217;t worth a diversion, can&#8217;t seriously support an alignment that orphans the Las Vegas train. In other words, the alignment is both what the voters approved and a sound route.</p>
<p>Now, bridging the Tehachapis is indeed challenging&#8211;the hardest part of the whole project. But spurious reporting from the <a href="http://la.streetsblog.org/2014/06/18/the-los-angeles-times-and-its-disgraceful-reporting-on-high-speed-rail/">LA Times</a> has Californians believing it&#8217;s insurmountable. That&#8217;s absurd; if laborers could build tracks through the Tehachipies in 1876, obviously it can be done again, and to HSR specifications. Considering the challenges of building HSR tunnels through the Hakkōda volcanic mountains in Japan, the Sierra de Guadarrama&#8217;s in Spain, other mountain ranges in Japan and China, not to mention the English Channel, pretending the Tehachapis are an unprecedented obstacle to an HSR project is just silly.</p>

<p>But the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/The-great-high-speed-rail-lie-2336677.php">same interests that fought HSR</a> in Florida, Texas, the Midwest and past projects in California, are never going to stop sowing misinformation to reporters and politicians. It wouldn&#8217;t matter if HSR was proposed from LA to San Diego again, or along I-5, or anywhere else&#8211;there&#8217;s a well-monied, well-oiled machine out there that will fight any project that reduces our dependence on cars and petroleum. It&#8217;s no coincidence that we&#8217;re seeing yet another potential <a href="http://cal.streetsblog.org/2016/02/16/boe-vice-chair-george-runner-wants-to-kill-public-transportation/">ballot initiative</a>—one of their favorite anti-rail weapons—to kill HSR by diverting the funds to water projects.</p>
<p>Water infrastructure has to come from HSR money? If we&#8217;re going to divert money from transportation to water, okay&#8211;stop widening roads right now. Speaking of which, why aren&#8217;t the same &#8220;fiscally conservative&#8221; HSR opponents complaining about widening, a true <a href="http://cal.streetsblog.org/2016/02/23/californians-are-paying-a-high-price-for-cheap-gas/">fiscal travesty</a>? Lets also remember that the bond set up funding for a host of connecting rail projects, including upgrades to <a href="http://www.sfcta.org/delivering-transportation-projects/central-subway">Muni</a> and Caltrain. The proposal, if it ends up on the November Ballot and passes, will take down vital transit projects all over the state.</p>
<p>That said, even Bay Area residents should be disappointed that the CaHSR Authority is forced to turn away from bridging the gap through the Tehachapis in the next phase of the project. Anyone who takes Amtrak from LA to the Bay Area understands why&#8211;right now, there&#8217;s a bus bridge from LA to Bakersfield because it&#8217;s not practical for Amtrak to use the old rail route through the mountains, which is slow, circuitous and saturated with freight trains. If the CaHSR Authority bridged the Tehachapis first, it would be possible to run a bullet train from LA to Bakersfield and up through a significant portion of the Central Valley at over 200 mph. Then the train could continue to Oakland on Amtrak&#8217;s existing &#8220;San Joaquin&#8221; tracks, towed by a diesel locomotive, as in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j1wvUIJyvs">demonstration run</a> from the 1990s. It&#8217;s not a very elegant solution, but it would give Californians a one-seat ride from LA to the Bay Area sooner. And prioritizing getting rid of the bus bridge from LA to Bakersfield was favored by most rail advocates. Still, it&#8217;s disingenuous for the politicians who have done everything possible to prevent that to now criticize the Authority for changing priorities.</p>
<p>All of that aside, modernizing the rail system from San Jose through the Central Valley first will have tremendous value in its own right. The fast connections will open new housing opportunities and reduce pollution from cars. The section has to be built anyway if there&#8217;s ever going to be a bullet train all the way from LA to San Francisco, so why not do it now?</p>
<p>There was a time when building transportation was something both parties agreed on and High-Speed Rail was once (and sometimes still is) supported by many prominent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/us/politics/for-high-speed-rail-support-in-the-past-from-gop-presidential-hopefuls.html?_r=0">Republicans</a>, including former <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifqqJbvAutQ">Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, who remains one of its biggest boosters. It&#8217;s time for our leaders, even those who don&#8217;t like HSR, to act like grownups and stop re-fighting a battle that was settled in 2008. So if Patterson and some of the other anti-rail lawmakers really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to go to the Bay Area first, they should stop their complaining and their parochial obstructionism, do their jobs as state lawmakers, and work to find a way to get the project over the mountains.</p>

<p>The Federal Highway Administration recently released figures showing that <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/02/09/more-driving-more-people-dying-on-americas-streets/">U.S. driving is way up</a>. In 2015, for the first time in nearly a decade, Americans drove more than the year before. In fact, the 2015 vehicle miles traveled surpassed the previous high from 2007.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/23/how-cheap-gas-is-going-to-ruin-your-morning/" target="_blank">Christopher Ingraham at the Washington Post&#8217;s Wonkblog parses the numbers</a>, and finds that the total number of miles driven in the country increased by four percent last year, the biggest jump in a single year since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>In California, according to the report [<a href="http://cal.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/02/15dectvt.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>], driving increased a lot more than that. On all roads, driving in California increased 11.3 percent over 2014. The increase was highest on urban aterials (11.5 percent over 2014).</p>
<p>California&#8217;s population has grown, and these numbers reflect overall growth. For the record, per capita driving has pretty much held steady, according to Ingraham; in 2015 per capita driving ticked upward, but it remains below year 2000 levels. In regards to congestion, emissions, and crashes, the overall numbers tell the story more clearly than per capita numbers.</p>
<p>Why all the driving?</p>
<p>One factor is today&#8217;s inexpensive gas. Gas has not been this cheap since 2004.</p>
<p>Falling gas prices means falling gas tax revenue, even if some people do buy more of it. Part of California&#8217;s complicated gas tax formula—do you really want to know the details?—includes sales taxes on gasoline. The sales taxes are based on a percentage of the price, not set at a per-gallon amount. Those go up and down with the price of gas. In addition, part of the per-gallon tax is readjusted every year to keep it “revenue neutral,” and the Board of Equalization just today voted to lower it again this coming July.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s cars are more fuel-efficient, which means fewer gallons of gas bought per mile driven, which further reduces revenue from gas taxes.</p>
<p>Fuel efficiency is good, but it comes with a down side. The gas tax used to be the source of money to keep roads maintained. Not anymore; about half of California&#8217;s transportation funding now comes from local sales taxes, which is paid by everyone, not just drivers. Generally those sales tax measures are slated for specific capital projects, not for maintenance, which, as every county in California has been complaining about, is badly needed. With gas tax revenues in decline, there is less and less money to maintain what we have already built, let alone to maintain all the new overpasses and road widenings on the books—or on hold, now that the state is cutting transportation funds. <span id="more-328273"></span></p>
<p>The ongoing—or maybe stalled, depending on your perspective—Special Session on Transportation in the California legislature has not been able to tackle this problem. Legislators and others keep demanding that we “fix our roads” but few will agree on how to pay for the fix. The most straightforward solution would be to recalibrate—ahem, raise—the gas tax. Senator Jim Beall, at least, is brave enough to say California needs to raise its gas tax, but <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520161SB1" target="_blank">his transportation funding bill</a> is moving glacially through the legislative process. And there are <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/05/06/is-raising-the-gas-tax-really-the-answer/">livability drawbacks to raising gas taxes</a>.</p>
<p>And a <a href="http://cal.streetsblog.org/2016/01/21/caltrans-seeking-5000-drivers-to-try-vmt-fee-instead-of-gas-tax/">pilot program to test the concept of a road users charge</a> is gearing up, but the pilot is just a simulation, with actual road charges still years away.</p>
<p>As cheap gas encourages people to drive more, it is also contributing to traffic congestion, which tends to drive people crazy. According to Ingraham, the average time commuters spend stuck in traffic is now 42 hours a year, more than double what was already bad in 1982.</p>
<p>Worse, <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/11/the-new-climate-villain-is-cheap-oil/">more driving will do a number on California&#8217;s efforts to fight climate change</a>. More driving produces more greenhouse gas emissions and more air pollution—and may do so for a long time to come. It also is making life a lot more dangerous for everyone, drivers as well as people on foot or bikes, with <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/02/09/more-driving-more-people-dying-on-americas-streets/">higher roadway fatalities following the upward trend in driving</a>.</p>
<p>So, yes, it is glorious that we can spend a little less on filling our tanks and a little more on food or housing or something, anything else—but we are paying a high price for that cheap gas.</p>

But as you read this, many buses and trains are at a standstill. They’re stopped as people fumble with dollar bills and coins, needlessly creating delays that our transit system can’t afford. </p>
<p>In San Francisco, it’s not unusual to wait 30 minutes for a bus or train. Muni averages just eight miles per hour and its vehicles show up late half the time. Our city spends $1 billion a year on Muni; for that we get America’s slowest and <a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/05/11/another-day-another-driver-blocking-munis-busiest-metro-line/">least reliable transit system</a>.  </p>
<p>There are many ideas to accelerate Muni but one stands out as cheap and easy: offer discounts for paying fares electronically.<br />
<span id="more-328225"></span><br />
<a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2010/09/15/despite-cost-clipper-card-promises-convenience/">Clipper Cards</a> have been around for years and Muni riders can even pay fares with a new smartphone app. But despite the convenience, about half of passengers still pay with cash—and with each transaction a surprisingly complicated ritual unfolds. First insert a dollar into the fare box, then one more, and then there&#8217;s the clumsy search for change. Finally, the driver tears off a transfer and hands it to the passenger. </p>
<p>Allowing a few seconds for this antiquated routine may not sound like a big deal. But on a single bus, hundreds of small inefficiencies can slow the vehicle by several minutes. Across Muni’s 1,000 vehicles and 82 routes, millions of little delays accumulate. That translates into many hours.</p>
<p>The unnecessary dawdling that happens when people pay with cash has real consequences, especially if you ride Muni to work. For hourly workers, Muni’s delays often mean docked paychecks and stressful warnings about losing their jobs. For salaried workers, Muni is a tired but widely accepted excuse for being late to work. And the costs are real.</p>
<p>In 2013, Muni’s delays cost workers $50 million in lost productivity. In April of that year, Muni riders were delayed a cumulative 19 years and eight months. </p>
<p>Speeding up Muni is a complex puzzle. And an important piece of it is to encourage people to skip the line at the fare box and board with a swift tap of a Clipper Card. That’s why I support SFMTA Director Ed Reiskin’s call for a 25 cent discount when paying with a Clipper Card.</p>
<p>Some have argued that this will burden the poor. But our city’s most vulnerable Muni riders already have access to discounted and free passes. Other cities incentivize electronic boarding. New York offers an 11 percent bonus. In Boston there’s a 50 cent incentive–twice what’s proposed here. In the East Bay, there’s an incentive on AC Transit. And London’s buses are already cashless.</p>
<p>Getting a Clipper Card is a simple, one-time task. And like our checkout bag ordinance, we know a small incentive can inspire changes that have a big impact.</p>
<p>It’s time to incentivize electronic boarding in San Francisco. If you support this common-sense upgrade to our transit system, please contact <a href="http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=7">Mayor Ed Lee</a>, your <a href="http://www.sfbos.org/">city supervisor</a>, and members of the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/contact-all-members-sfmta-board-directors">SFMTA board</a>. </p>

A good deal of the $46 billion the federal government pours into highway spending each year is going to waste, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report [PDF].

<p>A good deal of the $46 billion the federal government pours into highway spending each year is going to waste, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report [<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50150-Federal_Highway_Spending.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>].</p>
<p>The conclusion won&#8217;t surprise regular Streetsblog readers, but it&#8217;s the source that&#8217;s interesting. The CBO is not an advocacy group or an ideologically-minded think tank. It&#8217;s a non-partisan budget watchdog charged with evaluating federal spending decisions, and it says federal highway funding is not well-spent.</p>
<p>For one, the CBO thinks too much is spent on road expansion and too little on maintenance. The construction of the Interstate Highway System made freight shipping and traveling between cities much more efficient, the report says, but since the system was completed in the 1970s spending on highways has been subject to diminishing returns. Current spending &#8220;has not shifted&#8221; to account for the &#8220;the importance of maintaining existing capacity,&#8221; the CBO writes.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is induced demand. CBO points to a recent study finding that &#8220;the addition of new lanes is likely to have little effect on congestion within 10 years&#8221; as highway lanes fill with new drivers.</p>
<p><span id="more-328242"></span></p>
<p>In addition, what the U.S. does spend on maintenance flows disproportionally to lesser-used rural highways and not the urban interstates that carry the overwhelming majority of traffic, the CBO says. Urban interstates are in fact the only category of roads receiving federal highway funds where pavement quality is actually degrading.</p>
<p>Not all of the CBO&#8217;s ideas about road spending are good for cities (the report recommends spending more on expanding urban interstates), but it emphasizes some policy changes that would result in big savings and smarter decisions, including more widespread use of road pricing.</p>
<p>Putting a price on roads could be an alternative to expensive highway widening projects, the CBO writes. For example, congestion pricing could encourage drivers on less time-sensitive trips to avoid using highways during rush hours, lessening the pressure to expand roads.</p>
<p>Current federal law sharply restricts what transportation agencies can charge on existing interstate highways, and &#8220;only about 7 percent of the Interstate System is composed of highways with tolls,&#8221; the CBO reports. Loosening these restrictions could help America avoid wasting billions of dollars a year on highway expansions.</p>

As cyclists who use Page Street know all too well, there&#8217;s a tendency for motorists to jam up at the intersection with Octavia as they head to 101.

<p>As cyclists who use Page Street know all too well, there&#8217;s a tendency for motorists to jam up at the intersection with Octavia as they head to 101. And despite improvements and some traffic calming measures, it still turns into a bit of a mash up around the intersection, with cyclists trying to thread through the traffic jam. This weekend SFMTA rolled out a center-running green bike lane that helps formalize what most cyclists already do&#8211;pass to the left of the queue of cars waiting to turn right on Octavia.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_328195" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/page02_0.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-328195" src="http://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/page02_0-580x433.jpg" alt="SFMTA wants to avoid the confusion that develops at the intersection of Page and Octavia.

<p>Planners sometimes call this &#8220;formalizing goat trails,&#8221; meaning, at least with pedestrians, one looks at the worn grass or brush to figure out where people are walking. This is a great way to figure what&#8217;s automatically the most convenient route and where to add asphalt or pavers. The same thing happens with cyclists: by observing intersections and streets, smart planners can change street configuration to accommodate natural behaviors, such as&#8211;in this case&#8211;cyclists passing a line of cars waiting to turn right. The SFMTA reports it also added green bike boxes and sharrow markings to provide more intuitive, comfortable and visible space for people on bikes to wait for the traffic signal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_328191" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/160217_Page_Bike_27.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-328191" src="http://sf.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/160217_Page_Bike_27-580x386.jpg" alt="Paint Shop Crew Installing New Bike Lane on Page Street | February 17, 2016" width="580" height="386" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SFMTA added green paint to this center running bike route.

<p><span id="more-328188"></span><br />
While all of this is well and good, it&#8217;s still no substitute for fully built out, protected bike infrastructure. Painted markings are often sold as &#8220;better than nothing,&#8221; although even that&#8217;s not always <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/14/study-sharrows-dont-make-streets-safer-for-cycling/">clear</a>. That said, the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition is pleased with the improvements, explained Chris Cassidy, the organization&#8217;s spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;With all of the cars queued up at that intersection to turn right every morning, it just made sense for people biking to pass drivers on the left. The SFMTA&#8217;s efforts to keep people safe at Page and Octavia, and help us all avoid conflicts, deserve applause,&#8221; Cassidy said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SFMTA is also launching an apprenticeship program to &#8220;jump-start meaningful careers for local residents while developing the SFMTA’s skilled workforce of the future,&#8221; according to a release from the agency. The program is open to interested high school seniors, graduates, veterans, college students or those looking to change careers. SFMTA also reports that many of their workers are reaching retirement age and this is a way to assure there are skilled technicians moving forward.</p>

<p>Last week, the Senate Environmental Quality and the Select Committee on Climate Change and AB 32 Implementation held a joint hearing to discuss California&#8217;s successful worldwide leadership on climate change issues. In that hearing, the committee accepted much-deserved congratulations on the “business success” of cap-and-trade, which has created a source of funds for further state investment in greenhouse gas reductions.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Senate committee on Budget and Fiscal Review wrestled with the subject of those funds and how they should best be spent.</p>
<p>The three-and-a-half-hour-plus hearing barely touched on one pressing concern: forty percent of last year&#8217;s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) was left unallocated. The governor proposed rolling the money into this year&#8217;s budget, but that leaves a number of programs in jeopardy, and they may not survive until allocation decisions are made. Senator Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) urged the committee to make a decision sooner than later, and not to wait until the 2016-17 budget is finalized in June.</p>
<p>Some of the lawmakers were focused on only one thing: how many greenhouse gas emission reductions are we getting per dollar spent?</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness lens was emphasized by the Legislative Analyst&#8217;s Office in a report [<a href="http://cal.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/02/Cap-and-Trade-Expenditures-021816.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>] that raised questions about interactions between state regulation and investments in greenhouse gas reductions. The report concludes that the cap alone produces emission reductions without the trade part, and that state spending on programs and projects within the same sector as industries that are capped may not be able to produce further emissions.</p>
<p>For example, the fuels sector has a cap on emissions, so only a certain amount of greenhouse gasses are allowed to be emitted by the fuel industry. As more consumers choose zero emission vehicles and low carbon fuels, the demand for fuels decreases, but unless the cap is lowered, companies in the fuels sector can still buy the same number of allowances. Then they can either use them or sell them to someone else—but both outcomes would mean no further emission reductions, beyond the cap.</p>
<p>That raises the question of whether the state should be investing in sectors that are subject to the emissions cap, said Ross Brown of the LAO at the hearings.</p>
<p>But Matt Almy of the Department of Finance reminded legislators that cost effectiveness is only one of the ways to judge investments from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.<span id="more-328170"></span> “We try to be more holistic about what benefits we&#8217;re getting from our investments,” he said, using the Forest Health program as an example. He pointed to five different kinds of benefits that accrue to the state from investing in that program: greenhouse gas sequestration from preserving trees, reducing potential carbon emissions from wildfires, protecting public health and safety by reducing wildfires; providing renewable energy by using biomass from downed trees; and creating jobs in rural communities.</p>
<p>Programs benefiting from cap-and-trade investments have all emphasized “co-benefits” outside of merely reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Co-benefits include improved public health &#8211; from cleaner air and increased active transportation &#8211; and greater social justice from requirements that ensure that the most vulnerable communities are not the ones who pay to reduce greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The LAO report also raised questions about the administration&#8217;s three-year investment plan, claiming that the plan, which was submitted as required by law a few weeks ago [<a href="http://cal.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/02/Cap-and-Trade-Expenditures-021816.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>], “doesn&#8217;t contain a whole lot of meaningful information.” According to Brown, it lacks specifics about project outcomes and about how greenhouse gas emissions reductions estimates were developed.</p>
<p>Legislators reacted with some confusion and outrage to the report. Senator Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber), for example, leaped on the idea that cap-and-trade was raising a “tremendous amount of money” for a program with “no scientific basis.” “Most telling,” he said, “is the number of groups that descend on this legislative body every time there&#8217;s a hearing to get some of [that money].”</p>
<p>“There is too little certainty about this program,” he declared, “and I&#8217;m not willing to give a blank check to this administration.”</p>
<p>He took a moment to hit on a favorite talking point: “What is the impact of cap-and-trade for motorists?” He asked Brown. But he was only referring to the price of gas, not other proven benefits including improved transit and healthier air.</p>
<p>Ross answered that, because there are so many different elements at play, the impact is difficult to measure, but the closest estimates, based on the best information available, are that cap-and-trade raises the cost of gas “roughly ten cents a gallon or so.”</p>
<p>“So . . . there is some impact to all of this,” Neilsen insisted.</p>
<p>Senator Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) was more upset at the LAO&#8217;s charges that the investment plan lacked specifics. “I am a scientist,” he said, “and I have to concur . . . that you don&#8217;t set goals at the end of a process.”</p>
<p>But Almy and other agency representatives reassured the legislators. In fact, said Almy, cap-and-trade program goals have been set by the legislature and the governor, and they are clear: to meet the state&#8217;s broader climate strategies, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels; to invest in programs and projects that can help reduce greenhouse gases, as informed by public input when the cap-and-trade program was being developed; and to focus benefits on disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>“The LAO analysis highlights tradeoffs,” said Almy, “and it focuses on cost-effectiveness. Tradeoffs are necessary, but the administration takes a more holistic view that also includes a cost <em>benefit</em> consideration, as well as co-benefits.” He emphasized that the benefits of programs in the proposed spending plan are not standalone, but interconnected and interdependent, as in the example of the Forest Health program outlined above.</p>
<p>Richard Roth (D-Riverside) commented that the LAO&#8217;s analysis was important. “But I&#8217;m not sure the same degree of rigor has been applied to the benefit analysis as has been applied to the cost analysis,” he said. “We need to focus on greenhouse gas reductions, and on the other benefits these programs provide—because otherwise I don&#8217;t know how you would rank order the programs.”</p>
<p>There is nothing simple about estimating greenhouse gas emissions. They can not be measured in the same way that other pollutants can be. In addition, every program takes a different approach and its benefits have to measured differently. For example, better transit service and putting housing close to transit can both reduce car trips, but at different rates and in different ways.</p>
<p>So it is no surprise that there is confusion and disagreement.</p>
<p>Senator John Moorlach (R-Costa Mesa), asked several questions that gave the experts testifying to the committee the opportunity to explain some basics. For example, he wanted to know what disadvantaged communities have to do with greenhouse gases. “Don&#8217;t they cross borders and affect everyone?”</p>
<p>“There was concern that a cap-and-trade system would allow polluters to continue to pollute,” explained Matt Rodriquez, Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency. “That would put disadvantaged communities at an even further disadvantage because they are frequently located near sources of air pollution, which are linked to greenhouse gases.” Also, higher costs for energy, for example, as a result of a system that charges polluters for their emissions, would be passed on to ratepayers—which would disproportionately affect low-income people.</p>
<p>The hearing ended as Senator Nielsen predicted it would: with a long line of public commenters, many of whom were there to explain the benefits of their programs and why they should not be left out of the final funding plan.</p>

<p>One year after some progressive civil engineers around the country <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/03/11/engineering-establishment-sets-out-to-purge-deviant-bikeway-designs/">feared a crackdown</a> against new-fangled street and signal designs, the opposite seems to be taking place.</p>
<p>The obscure but powerful <a href="http://www.ncutcd.org/">National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a>, which has often been a drag on changes in American street design, is now moving on several fronts to bring in new blood and prepare U.S. streets for a future that&#8217;d be much friendlier to biking and walking.</p>
<p>One of its member organizations is organizing into a disciplined voting bloc in favor of better tools to improve biking and walking. A prominent organization for urbanist transportation pros, <a href="http://nacto.org">NACTO</a>, may be invited to join. And just Thursday, the Federal Highway Administration wrapped up a <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FHWA_FRDOC_0001-1260">public comment period</a> that could lead to the NCUTCD greatly accelerating updates to the design guidance it gives cities around the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most exciting time in my career,&#8221; said Dongho Chang, Seattle&#8217;s city traffic engineer and one of the NCUTCD&#8217;s new voting members this year. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re on the cusp of having that committee think much more broadly than just the highway focus.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Institute for Transportation Engineers will use its votes to support &#8216;multimodal decisions&#8217;</h2>
<p><div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img id="ITE President Paula Benway" style="float: right;margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;border-width: 1px;border-style: solid" title="ITE President Paula Benway" src="http://peopleforbikes.org/page/-/uploads/GLP/paula%20benway%20300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="331" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ITE President Paula Benway.</p></div></p>
<p>The shifts have accelerated since Jan. 1, when one of the NCUTCD&#8217;s major affiliate groups, the <a href="http://www.ite.org/">Institute for Transportation Engineers</a>, inducted a new president.</p>
<p>As one of her first initiatives in office, ITE President Paula Benway began using ITE&#8217;s eight voting seats on the NCUTCD to push for change on the national committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to call it a ghost committee &#8212; nobody knew anything about it,&#8221; Benway, a longtime transportation consultant in Rochester, N.Y. who now works for Stantec in Tampa, said in an interview last week. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot of concerns, and I promised I was going to take some action to make it a little more visible, make it a little more transparent.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Benway began sticking to ITE&#8217;s previously unenforced term limits on its NCUTCD delegates. And she also gave them a new rule: Those delegates would report to ITE&#8217;s leadership regularly to make sure their voting record on NCUTCD reflects ITE goals like making streets biking- and walking-friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their decisions must be aligned to what ITE stands for,&#8221; Benway said in an interview last week. &#8220;That we&#8217;re foward-thinking. That we&#8217;re willing to experiment with new treatments, especially with multimodal decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Benway, making the NCUTCD more receptive to bike-specific facilities is personal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a cyclist myself, so I have a soft spot for multimodal facilities, and that&#8217;s what I promote in everything I do professionally,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Chang, who has <a href="https://nextcity.org/features/view/seattle-transportation-planning-complete-streets">earned a reputation</a> as one of the country&#8217;s most progressive engineers on biking and walking infrastructure, called Benway a &#8220;game changer&#8221; for ITE.</p>
<h2>Urbanist professionals&#8217; group invited to join MUTCD as voting member</h2>
<p><div style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://peopleforbikes.org/page/-/uploads/GLP/cheap%20curb%20extension.png" alt="" width="570" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Seattle City Traffic Engineer Dongho Chang, left, shows a low-cost curb extension to a visiting delegation from Indianapolis.</p></div></p>
<p>Last year, Chang was among several urbanist engineers named to an NCUTCD task force that was assigned to help the national committee solve a problem.</p>
<p>The problem: U.S. cities were rapidly importing ideas from abroad, like painted bike lanes and dedicated bike signals, before the MUTCD had had a chance to fully approve them.</p>
<p>Most people agreed that this was creating inconsistency.</p>
<p>To pick one example: Memphis was using green paint to mark the parts of bike lanes that cars might cross, while New York City was using green paint to mark the parts of bike lanes where cars can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The NCUTCD task force might have chosen to condemn cities that used new designs without permission. Instead, Chang said, it came to the conclusion that the NCUTCD needed to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the task force said was, &#8216;You&#8217;re not serving the needs of the community. You need to change this process,'&#8221; Chang said.</p>
<p>During that conversation: Chang and another urbanist engineer in the group, Peter Koonce of Portland, started pitching an idea: inviting the progressive, city-focused National Association of City Transportation Officials to become an NCUTCD member organization alongside ITE, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials and others.</p>
<p>Chang hopes that NACTO will decide to formally apply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would create a paradigm shift,&#8221; Chang said. &#8220;Having NACTO on the board saying &#8216;these are the tools that we need to have for the manuals, these are the things we need to have for the research,&#8217; they can help drive some of the agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chang said he &#8220;would think&#8221; that an organization of NACTO&#8217;s size (it has 12 staffers and hosts a <a href="http://nacto.org/designingcities2015/">significant annual conference</a>) would get the same eight seats as the NCUTCD&#8217;s founding organizations, ITE and AASHTO.</p>
<p>&#8220;If NACTO really wants to provide long-term change then being part of the committee is a huge mechanism,&#8221; Chang said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably one of the most effective ways to get these tools to practitioners.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Federal Highway Administration weighs faster changes to crucial street manual</h2>
<p><div style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://peopleforbikes.org/page/-/uploads/GLP/austin%204th%20street.jpg" alt="" width="570" /><p class="wp-caption-text">4th Street, Austin, Texas: A popular protected bike lane designed without guidance from the MUTCD.</p></div></p>
<p>The third front of change at the NCUTCD is in the hands of the federal agency that gives the private committee its authority: the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
<p>In December, the FHWA <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FHWA_FRDOC_0001-1260">requested comments</a> about, among other things, the &#8220;frequency of MUTCD editions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Updates to the NCUTCD&#8217;s massive <a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm">Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a> are notoriously slow-moving. The text of the current edition was prepared in 2007; the next one may not be adopted at the state level until 2021.</p>
<p>Benway, Chang and others worry that that&#8217;s an eternity in the fast-evolving transportation world.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the MUTCD and say all of this stuff looks like it was written in the mid-90s, that&#8217;s because it was,&#8221; said Matthew Roe, the director of NACTO&#8217;s Designing Cities Intiative.</p>
<p>Roe said that the FHWA &#8220;definitely look like they&#8217;re fishing&#8221; for people to respond with ideas for either splitting the MUTCD into two documents, one updated more frequently than the other, or distinguishing between two types of content in the manual, with one content type updated more freuqently than the other.</p>
<p>ITE this month urged the FHWA to take the latter route, creating separate processes for updating the MUTCD&#8217;s &#8220;standards&#8221; (things like the proper color of plastic posts that separate a bike lane) and its &#8220;guidance&#8221; (things like whether it&#8217;s OK to use plastic posts to separate a bike lane).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8tOk7_upXv5QjVzazhPX3F6Ym5nZHM0WWxDa1JRODF4MHlv/view?usp=sharing">ITE&#8217;s letter</a>, Benway suggested a regular process for making small revisions to the MUTCD &#8220;every 2-3 years&#8221; in between its major updates every six to eight years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular updates will allow the MUTCD to change with time to reflect the growing number and application of traffic control devices,&#8221; Benway wrote.</p>

<p>Over a hundred people braved the wind and rain yesterday evening to attend the latest public outreach meeting about SFMTA&#8217;s planned &#8220;<a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/04/27/eyes-on-the-street-new-muni-signage-route-names-and-maps-in-action/">Muni Forward</a>&#8221; improvements to the L-Taraval streetcar line. The meeting was held at Dianne Feinstein Elementary school, about two blocks south of Taraval.</p>
<p>District 4 Supervisor Katy Tang kicked off the meeting. &#8220;I am here to listen,&#8221; she stressed, talking about the importance of public comment in formulating transit improvements. The main presentation was given by Sean Kennedy, SFMTA Muni Forward Program Manager. He talked about how SFMTA, as part of the Vision Zero goals, had identified Taraval as a street where safety improvements are needed. &#8220;22 people have been hit in the past five years getting off trains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And 46 total,&#8221; making it part of the city&#8217;s &#8220;High Injury Network.&#8221;</p>
<p>To reduce these collisions, the agency is looking at installing more concrete platforms in some places and improving markings and law enforcement in others. Kennedy explained that a common problem is too many motorists do not understand that it is illegal to pass a stopped train when it is loading and unloading passengers. &#8220;Around a third of motorists ignore state law, putting passengers in danger,&#8221; he said.<br />

<p>The project includes general improvements, such as rail replacement and upgrades, to smooth out and quiet the ride. They will also paint the track area as red, transit-only lanes.</p>
<p>However, Kennedy had to struggle to get through his presentation, as he was continually interrupted and shouted down by an unruly audience. &#8220;You&#8217;re taking parking away!&#8221; was a common refrain. Kennedy tried to explain that, yes, in places a handful of parking spots would be removed to make room for safety platforms and markings to protect riders and other pedestrians, but they would be replaced, on a one-for-one basis, with parking on side streets. When he stressed again that they need this to create safety refuges for passengers, one person shouted &#8220;Why not get people to comply when they get off the train!&#8221; The same person <a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2014/01/10/more-sfpd-pedestrian-victim-blaming-taraval-stations-insane-flyer/">blamed Muni riders</a> who got hit by cars for &#8220;wearing dark clothes at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another complained that replacing parking around the corner was not good enough. &#8220;You&#8217;re still ruining it for those merchants!&#8221; Another man shouted that 22 people hit while alighting the trains &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem like that many&#8221; and does not warrant making changes.</p>
<p>After about 40 minutes, Kennedy got through his presentation&#8211;and constant interruptions&#8211;and he invited questions. &#8220;You&#8217;re following a procedure called decide, announce, defend!&#8221; said Doug Buchwald, a resident of Berkeley who frequents the area. He dismissed the notion that Muni was listening to audience suggestions. &#8220;I&#8217;m here because I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teri Lenfest, an Outer Parkside resident who held a cane, suggested Muni &#8220;take a hint from the railroads&#8221; and have grade-crossing barriers come down to block automobiles from endangering pedestrians. Kennedy suggested that would not work, as motorists would just go around them.</p>
<p>Buchwald complained that the plan to speed up the train by <a href="http://la.streetsblog.org/2015/09/23/open-thread-metro-considering-bus-stop-thinning-in-network-plan/">eliminating some stops</a> was tantamount to &#8220;having two stops for the entire line, one at each end,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That may sound funny, but if you have mobility problems and it&#8217;s your stop that gets eliminated, they may as well do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Audience members also grumbled that they couldn&#8217;t hear the speakers and that the presentation should have been in multiple languages. Paul Rose, chief spokesman for SFMTA, said, &#8220;it&#8217;s about the parking, they have misconceptions about the parking.&#8221; He also stressed that many more people <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/projects-planning/projects/l-taraval-rapid-project">comment about the project online</a>. &#8220;Our main priority is safety&#8211;by 2024 we want to all but eliminate road fatalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>SFMTA also did surveys and went door to door for feedback. When pushed as to why the people at this meeting seemed unusually distrustful and irritable, Rose shrugged. &#8220;These are the people who showed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>What vehicle produces no emissions, uses no fossil fuels, is easily maintained, costs little, gets you where you want to go quickly, and improves your health?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, a bicycle.</p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t the California Air Resources Board (ARB), which is spending millions of dollars on incentives and rebates to get people to buy zero-emission vehicles, offer anything similar to encourage people to buy bicycles?</p>
<p>The California Bicycle Coalition asked that question. Now it&#8217;s joining with several partners to ask the ARB to create a <a href="http://www.fixcaliforniaroads.org/arbletter" target="_blank">Bicycle Purchase Incentive Pilot Program</a> as part of its ongoing vehicle rebate program.</p>
<p>CalBike proposes offering rebates for</p>
<blockquote><p>half of the cost of bikes that are commonly used for commuting, up to a maximum rebate of $500. Under the program, California would pay for half the cost of cargo bikes, electric bikes, folding bikes, bike-share, and other utilitarian bicycles used for everyday transportation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The proposed cost of the program, $10 million, is peanuts next to the $206 million ARB gives out through its <a href="https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/eng" target="_blank">Clean Vehicle Rebate Project</a> (CVRP). And that $10 million would buy a lot more vehicles—bicycles—than the CVRP can.</p>
<p><span id="more-328123"></span>And anyway, half of the CVRP rebates have gone to households with incomes over $150,000, according to testimony from the ARB&#8217;s Alberto Ayala at a legislative hearing last week on State Environmental Incentives for Low- and Moderate-Income Families. Those generally aren&#8217;t the households that need help making car payments.</p>
<p>ARB has tried to find ways to get incentives into the hands of people who really need the money. For example, it instituted an income cap for people receiving electric vehicle rebates—but at $250,000 for one-person households that cap is close to meaningless. ARB also adjusts rebate amounts according to income level, but Ayala admitted that it&#8217;s been a struggle to bring low-income people into the program. Even the pilot <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/aqip/efmp/efmp.htm" target="_blank">Plus-Up Program</a>, which is specifically targeted at low- and moderate-income people, leaves the average participant with out-of-pocket costs of $12,000 <em>after the rebate</em>, according to Ayala.</p>
<p>$500 for a bike would be a lot easier to come up with.</p>
<p>Ayala testified that the CVRP&#8217;s priority, based on public input when it was being formed, is “the transformation of the fleet.” ARB has focused on accelerating the market for zero emission cars by encouraging people to buy, and manufacturers to make, as many different models as possible. Low production means high costs, and ARB is hoping the rebate programs will be a factor in driving down prices so that in the future they are not needed.</p>
<p>CalBike sees the same promise for bicycles, especially e-bikes and cargo bikes. “Providing subsidies for bicycle purchases would increase the affordability of these high-quality, zero-emission vehicles and stimulate the market for bicycles, especially for emerging technologies in electric-assist bicycles and cargo bicycles, continuing to drive down prices,” says CalBike&#8217;s letter to ARB.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our proposal leverages the existing, successful “Increased Incentives for Public Fleets Project” which encourages public agencies to turn over their automobile fleets to electric vehicles by encouraging them to replace many of those vehicles with high-quality utilitarian bicycles, getting greater value for each dollar invested in greenhouse gas reduction.</p></blockquote>
<p>A high-quality bike that can replace car trips—including electric bicycles, cargo bikes, folding bicycles, and other commuter-style bicycles—can cost $1,000 or more, which is a real cost barrier for low-income consumers and for families that need multiple bicycles. The CalBike proposal is careful to make sure its benefits will go where needed. It calls for income eligibility requirements, for example, and for expanding bike-share systems into low-income communities, and for corporate or public agency fleets that are located in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>CalBike has been suggesting this program to the ARB informally for a number of months, as part of the ongoing public input process on ARB&#8217;s emission reduction programs. There hasn&#8217;t been much response, so the group has drafted a letter and is gathering partners in a coalition to present the idea formally to ARB in the next week or so.</p>

<p>BART&#8217;s board and staff is working on a $3 billion bond that, if approved by the BART Board this summer, will appear on the November ballot. If the voters go for it, it will help fund upgrades and maintenance to existing infrastructure. Even though it&#8217;s primarily about maintenance and upgrades to existing tracks and tunnels, advocates are pushing to have $200 million of it earmarked towards more planning for a second Transbay crossing.</p>
<p>Either way, number one on the to-do list is replacing BART&#8217;s forty year old signaling system, explained Alicia Trost, a BART spokeswoman. &#8220;It&#8217;s the number one cause of delays,&#8221; she said. Right now, BART uses a fixed-block signal system, she explained&#8211;which means trains are kept from crashing into each other by making sure two trains never enter the same fixed length of tracks. Riders experience the downside of this old system when their trains stop in the Transbay tube for no apparent reason; the train is waiting until the train in front, which may actually be a safe distance away, has left the next segment of track.</p>
<p>Under the new train system, computers simply maintain a minimum distance between trains as they move, which will let &#8220;the new train cars run more frequently. Headways would be improved,&#8221; she said. There are also portions of the Market Street tunnel that are leaking water and need to be sealed. In addition, she said, 90 miles of rails would be replaced along with electrical power systems.</p>
<p>All necessary work, but this falls short of what advocates want to see. &#8220;We have a responsibility to plan for the future of the system,&#8221; said Ratna Amin, Transportation Policy Director for the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR). And while she agrees there are immediate and pressing upgrades and repairs required for existing infrastructure, that shouldn&#8217;t supplant future planning. &#8220;You don&#8217;t abandon one and work on the other,&#8221; she said.<br />
<span id="more-328099"></span><br />
No argument there, but BART&#8217;s Board of Directors is already concerned about asking for too much with the bond, considering that it would cost some $13 billion to fund a second set of Transbay tubes. A <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_28387754/poll-residents-would-support-3-billion-bart-bond">poll done earlier this year</a> shows that if they up the amount on the bond beyond about $4.5 billion, it starts to fail to reach the two-thirds voter threshold to pass. The bond will be paid back by a property tax that will come to roughly $45 a year per property owner, for the next three decades.</p>
<p>Additionally, the research shows that while people support the idea of a second set of tubes, they don&#8217;t give it a high priority. But there is something the BART board of directors can do to start the ball rolling. And this is what SPUR is advocating for with a <a href="http://www.spur.org/publications/white-paper/2016-02-10/designing-bay-areas-second-transbay-rail-crossing">white paper</a> it released a few days ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The staff proposal has a $200 million pot for long term planning&#8211;but there&#8217;s no commitment in there&#8221; to plan for a second set of tubes, said Amin. &#8220;It could be zero. It could be $200 million.&#8221; Advocates want that money committed to studying the tubes. And if a comprehensive study is done, the money will eventually come from Washington, they hope.</p>
<p>That said, this is hardly the first time advocates and BART officials themselves have argued for a <a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2014/12/01/bart-will-study-second-transbay-tube-west-side-extension/">second set of BART tubes</a>. Nevertheless, &#8220;I think money from the bond can help make it more shovel ready, so when a new congress comes along that values big infra projects this will be ready to go,&#8221; said Jonathan Fearn, an advocate with “<a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/12/09/repairing-the-gash-in-the-heart-of-oakland/">Connect Oakland</a>,&#8221; a group that wants to remove I-980 from where it divides downtown Oakland and replace it with a surface level street, and a BART and Caltrain tube underneath.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bay Area is an economic engine nationally. The federal government has to come in and help make the economy more resilient,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SPUR&#8217;s white paper, meanwhile, envisions several options, including one that wouldn&#8217;t carry BART&#8217;s current fleet of trains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to separate BART the technology from BART the system,&#8221; said Amin. Because BART is non-standard gauge, there may be a greater advantage, she explained, to building tubes that would connect up Amtrak&#8217;s Capitol Corridor, High Speed Rail and Caltrain across the Bay.</p>
<p>Electrification would allow speeds and train frequencies that would rival and exceed BART&#8217;s current fleet. Fearn, however, thinks if they are going to go through the expense of building a second crossing, it should have four tubes&#8211;two for BART and two for standard trains.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re making an investment that large, make it as accommodating as possible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We saw how short-sighted we were with two tunnels when we built the original crossing; we don&#8217;t want to be that short sighted moving forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regardless, Amin and Fearn agree that the Bay Area economy is endangered by having only the one crossing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a risk to have no redundancy,&#8221; said Amin. &#8220;We have to keep planning it today. We don&#8217;t have to built it tomorrow. But we have to build consensus.&#8221;</p>

<p>But schools haven&#8217;t been very successful at tackling what is arguably a much bigger threat to children&#8217;s health: air pollution caused by driving. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. Car exhaust can <a href="http://www.momscleanairforce.org/focus-on-asthma/" target="_blank">trigger attacks</a> and <a href="http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2008/05/06/asthma_and_idling/" target="_blank">may cause asthma itself</a>, and schools are where children tend to be especially exposed. In school zones, levels of air pollutants &#8220;may significantly exceed community background levels, particularly in the presence of idling school buses,&#8221; <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/em/c3em00377a#!divAbstract" target="_blank">according to researchers with the Cincinnati Children&#8217;s Hospital Medical Center</a>.</p>
<p>Every morning and afternoon at schools around the country, pick-up and drop-off times are free-for-alls of mindless idling, with tailpipes spitting poisonous chemicals into the air children breathe. &#8220;Monitoring at schools has shown elevated levels of benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and other air toxics during the afternoon hour coinciding with parents picking up their children,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/region8/idle-free-schools" target="_blank">U.S. EPA</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;One major issue with air pollution is that it is invisible,&#8221; says Anneka Whisker of the group Moms for Clean Air. &#8220;Out of sight, out of mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. Here are five things schools can do to help reduce pollution from idling and asthma.</p>
<p><strong>1. Encourage active transportation</strong></p>
<p>To reduce air pollution at school, make walking and biking as safe and practical as possible.</p>
<p><span id="more-328097"></span></p>
<p>According to the U.S. EPA [<a href="http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/ochp_2015_near_road_pollution_booklet_v16_508.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>], school strategies aimed at boosting active transportation can have a real impact. Traffic volumes near Roosevelt Middle School in Eugene, Oregon, for instance, dropped 24 percent after the addition of walking and biking paths, the agency reports.</p>
<p>The EPA also has guidelines for school siting [<a href="http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/ochp_2015_near_road_pollution_booklet_v16_508.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]. It recommends choosing a site that many students can walk to and that provides good active transportation opportunities, not a far-away site that would require longer bus rides or drives.</p>
<p><strong>2. Establish anti-idling zones near schools</strong></p>
<p>Encouraging parents to shut off the engine can help make schools healthier places. The EPA provides an &#8220;<a href="http://www.epa.gov/region8/idle-free-schools" target="_blank">idle-free toolkit</a>,&#8221; complete with signs, brochures and parent pledges, to schools interested in improving air quality.</p>
<p>Reducing idling around schools can have a big effect. Researchers at the Cincinnati Children&#8217;s Hospital <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/em/c3em00377a#!divAbstract" target="_blank">found</a> idle-free zones could reduce carbon pollution by 63 percent and particulate pollution by 74 percent.</p>
<p>Although the EPA encourages idle-free school zones, it&#8217;s not clear how many schools participate in its initiative. In West Virginia, for instance, the state EPA reports that just 12 schools have &#8220;idle-free zones.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Don&#8217;t let school buses idle unnecessarily</strong></p>
<p>In total, 17 states have rules that limit idling for school buses or other vehicles in school zones, according to <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/idle-moments-turn-into-to/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>. California, which has prohibited school bus idling since 2003, is a leader in this respect. But across the nation, these rules are poorly enforced.</p>
<p>The Ohio EPA <a href="http://www.odh.ohio.gov/~/media/ODH/ASSETS/Files/eh/school%20environmental%20health/busidlingpolicy.ashx" target="_blank">recommends</a> school district policy should limit idling by buses to less than five minutes, even in cold weather, except in a few circumstances. Bus drivers should be notified of the policy by letter, and it should be enforced by penalizing drivers who break the rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bus routes should be timed so children and drivers do not need to spend a lot of extra time on the bus when it is not en route, particularly in hot or cold weather. In addition, auxiliary heaters can be purchased and installed to keep the cabin comfortable,&#8221; the agency recommends.</p>
<p><strong>4. Retrofit school bus engines for cleaner operation</strong></p>
<p>About 25 million American school children ride the bus to school every day. But diesel engines are enormous polluters. Worse, in school buses a lot of the pollution gets trapped inside. According to the <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/cleaning-dirty-school-buses" target="_blank">Environmental Defense Fund</a>, studies have found that fine particle pollution inside school buses can be five to six times higher than ambient air levels.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/cleaning-dirty-school-buses" target="_blank">The federal government and many states offer grants</a> to retrofit school bus engines to dramatically reduce emissions. Some schools have also reduced the replacement timeline for buses in order to convert to a newer, cleaner-running fleet, the EPA reports.</p>
