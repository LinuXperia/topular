Mr. Tie Folder was someone I knew from a place of employment that has long since disappeared.  There were thousands of faces and his was just one of them.  We were not friends by any definition of the word, but he recently dogged me for about a year to "Friend" him on Facebook.

Once I hit the magic "Confirm" button, he started appearing regularly on my page.  It seemed that no matter what time I posted a blog, his response would appear within minutes.

It didn't matter if it was 1:00 AM, 6:00 AM or 3:00 in the afternoon.

His comments were neither original nor sinister, just the usual, "<em>You're a lefty</em>," "<em>Hillary sucks</em>," etc.  Sometimes he was funny, but mostly droll.

This pattern went on for a few years when, last week he sent me the following message on Facebook:

"<em>I had brain surgery partially disabled am ordered not to be political by dr please get me off your Facebook page thks</em>"

I'm not kidding.  That was the actual message.  Ver-freakin-batim.  As you might guess, I found that message strange on many levels.

Did his neurosurgeon really order him not to read my Facebook page?  Was Lenny's brain surgery unsuccessful?  Would his continued reading of posts on my Facebook page cause him to stroke out?  If he was disabled and in such fragile condition, why was he perusing my Facebook page in the first place?

Perhaps the main question begged here was whether or not Mr. Tie Folder was yanking my tie.  Was he just making all that up or did he have so much of his brain removed that he didn't know what he was saying?

Erring on the side of safety, I told Mr. Tie Folder that I was sorry to hear of his medical tribulations and wished him a speedy recovery (if that was even in the cards).  I advised him not to read my posts and to "Unfriend" me to prevent my toxic drivel from encroaching upon his convalescence.

I got the following response a couple days later:

"<em>bob I am partly disabled I don't lore how to befriend you and their is no phone number that I can find you have a right to your opinion but could you show me how Please it's affecting my health</em>"

Again, verbatim.  You can't make this stuff up.  I immediately "Unfriended" Lenny, just so nobody could accuse me of pushing him over the edge, but anyone who puts their health in my hands does so at his peril.

Is this really a thing?  Can my silly little posts present a mortal danger to a reader who can't seem to look away?

I read a lot of stuff,  Right Wing, Left Wing, Al Jazeera, Stormfront (a white supremacist thing) and all sorts of extremist propaganda.  Some of it brings my blood to a near boil.

The thing is, you need to know what's out there to achieve perspective.  If you really can't abide the words of someone with whom you vehemently disagree, you shouldn't read those words.

Don't put the burden of what you read on those who write.  Pretty soon we'll be down in Midland, Texas burning textbooks.

You may think that the story ends here, but after all of Lenny's <a href="http://www.yiddishslangdictionary.com/word/281/mishegas">mishegas </a>about his grave infirmity, I got the following Facebook message from him yesterday:

"<em>You are a useful idiot you should be ashamed of yourself</em>"

I"m guessing that he meant to say that I am a "<em><strong>useless</strong> idiot</em>," not a "<em>useful</em>" one, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thanked him for pointing out that I was, at least useful.

To which he replied, "<em>Say that to my face big boy</em>"

Either Lenny has been lying about his condition or I've been challenged to a fight by a partly disabled, neurosurgical patient.   That's a first, even for me.

My alternative theory is that Lenny is one of the actual-news-challenged aliens who can't allow any thoughts into their heads that conflict with the directives of the mother Fox ship.

Next Sunday, as part of Team XRT, I'm going to take the Polar Plunge, in support of Special Olympics.

I'm thinking about asking Lenny Tie Folder to join me.  I just need to figure out how to ask him in what capacity he could participate.

Ted Cruz thinks Scalia should be replaced by a justice who is at least as screwed up as his predecessor.  While there's no shortage of right wing nut jobs, Cruz's comments sum it up in a nutshell.

They don't want anyone listening to cases and judging them in accordance with a reasonable reading of the Constitution.  They only want justices who support the most extreme views of their whacked out base, the more extreme the better.

Scalia was instrumental in the 2008 ruling giving individual citizens unrestricted access to all manner of weaponry.  In case you haven't read it, this is the most commonly used itereation of the 2nd Amendment:

"<em>A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed</em>."

Obviously, Scalia's interpretation relies heavily on the second part of that sentence, the part that says, "<em>the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed</em>."

It should, however be clear to anyone with even a modest, American-style primary education that the "<em>right of the people</em>" is predicated on "<em>A well regulated militia</em>"  and maintaining "<em>the security of a free state</em>."

Without getting into a detailed and protracted discussion of the 2nd Amendment, no reasonable person could interpret it to mean that every knuckle-dragging yahoo is entitled to buy all the fire power he can carry, with no vetting process whatsoever.

Let's forget about the 2nd Amendment for a while, we don't want to upset a bunch of guys with loaded sub machine guns and rocket launchers.

Let's talk about some of Scalia's world views, religious and otherwise.

Mr. Scalia watched the Flintstones like it was a documentary.  He believed that humans and dinosaurs shared the Earth beginning about 6,000 years ago.

To Scalia, the phrase, "The Devil made me do it" had literal meaning.

Scalia said that black people would benefit from being excluded from the best of our universities because the curriculum were too challenging.

Scalia recently told a high school audience that non-religious people were not entitled to equal treatment under the Constitution.

"To tell you the truth, there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition. Where did that come from?" he said. "To be sure, you can't favor one denomination over another but can't favor religion over non-religion?"

Apparently Mr. Strict-Interpreter-of-the-Constitution had some revisions in mind for the 1st Amendment.  Which brings us to the current dilemma of finding Mr. Scalia's replacement.

For several years we've been listening to the esteemed leaders of the Republican Party tell us how the President is in constant, flagrant disregard of the Constitution.

Now that it comes to the President doing exactly what the Constitution tells him to do with regard to filling vacancies on the Supreme Court, those same constitutional scholars have decided that what the Constitution says is not what the Constitution means.

Interesting, huh?

It's also interesting that prior to 1916, there were no significant confirmation hearings for Supreme Court justices.  It was a matter of simple procedure, the president's nominations were routinely confirmed by the Senate with little fanfare.

What happened in 1916 to change that, you ask.  Good question.

In 1916 Woodrow Wilson nominated <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/louis-brandeis-39048">Louis Brandeis</a> to the Supreme Court.  Brandeis, one of the foremost jurist to ever inhabit that rarefied atmosphere was also the first Jewish Supreme Court justice.

There were a few scattered confirmation hearings after Brandeis, but it didn't turn into a sideshow until the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/army-mccarthy-hearings">Army-McCarthy hearings</a> in 1954 gave our legislators the idea that this new fangled TV thing was the perfect place to prance and preen before their constituents.

More fun facts:

President Obama is not a "lame duck" president.  He is a president in the last year of his term who will become a lame duck AFTER the November election.

Supreme Court justices have regularly been nominated by presidents in their last year.  Justice Anthony Kennedy was nominated by President Reagan during the last year of his presidency.

As was often the case, Kennedy was confirmed by a vote of 97-0.

Generally speaking, don't listen to the Fox News/Marco Rubio/Ted Cruz version of events.  You have to do the work yourself.  Those guys are usually either wrong on the facts or just plain lying.

With all due respect, I suspect the latter.

Godspeed, Mr. Scalia.  I wish I could say you served us well.

Ted Cruz thinks Scalia should be replaced by a justice who is at least as screwed up as his predecessor.  While there's no shortage of right wing nut jobs, Cruz's comments sum it up in a nutshell.

They don't want anyone listening to cases and judging them in accordance with a reasonable reading of the Constitution.  They only want justices who support the most extreme views of their whacked out base, the more extreme the better.

Scalia was instrumental in the 2008 ruling giving individual citizens unrestricted access to all manner of weaponry.  In case you haven't read it, this is the most commonly used itereation of the 2nd Amendment:

"<em>A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed</em>."

Obviously, Scalia's interpretation relies heavily on the second part of that sentence, the part that says, "<em>the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed</em>."

It should, however be clear to anyone with even a modest, American-style primary education that the "<em>right of the people</em>" is predicated on "<em>A well regulated militia</em>"  and maintaining "<em>the security of a free state</em>."

Without getting into a detailed and protracted discussion of the 2nd Amendment, no reasonable person could interpret it to mean that every knuckle-dragging yahoo is entitled to buy all the fire power he can carry, with no vetting process whatsoever.

Let's forget about the 2nd Amendment for a while, we don't want to upset a bunch of guys with loaded sub machine guns and rocket launchers.

Let's talk about some of Scalia's world views, religious and otherwise.

Mr. Scalia watched the Flintstones like it was a documentary.  He believed that humans and dinosaurs shared the Earth beginning about 6,000 years ago.

To Scalia, the phrase, "The Devil made me do it" had literal meaning.

Scalia said that black people would benefit from being excluded from the best of our universities because the curriculum were too challenging.

Scalia recently told a high school audience that non-religious people were not entitled to equal treatment under the Constitution.

"To tell you the truth, there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition. Where did that come from?" he said. "To be sure, you can't favor one denomination over another but can't favor religion over non-religion?"

Apparently Mr. Strict-Interpreter-of-the-Constitution had some revisions in mind for the 1st Amendment.  Which brings us to the current dilemma of finding Mr. Scalia's replacement.

For several years we've been listening to the esteemed leaders of the Republican Party tell us how the President is in constant, flagrant disregard of the Constitution.

Now that it comes to the President doing exactly what the Constitution tells him to do with regard to filling vacancies on the Supreme Court, those same constitutional scholars have decided that what the Constitution says is not what the Constitution means.

Interesting, huh?

It's also interesting that prior to 1916, there were no significant confirmation hearings for Supreme Court justices.  It was a matter of simple procedure, the president's nominations were routinely confirmed by the Senate with little fanfare.

What happened in 1916 to change that, you ask.  Good question.

In 1916 Woodrow Wilson nominated <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/louis-brandeis-39048">Louis Brandeis</a> to the Supreme Court.  Brandeis, one of the foremost jurist to ever inhabit that rarefied atmosphere was also the first Jewish Supreme Court justice.

There were a few scattered confirmation hearings after Brandeis, but it didn't turn into a sideshow until the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/army-mccarthy-hearings">Army-McCarthy hearings</a> in 1954 gave our legislators the idea that this new fangled TV thing was the perfect place to prance and preen before their constituents.

More fun facts:

President Obama is not a "lame duck" president.  He is a president in the last year of his term who will become a lame duck AFTER the November election.

Supreme Court justices have regularly been nominated by presidents in their last year.  Justice Anthony Kennedy was nominated by President Reagan during the last year of his presidency.

As was often the case, Kennedy was confirmed by a vote of 97-0.

Generally speaking, don't listen to the Fox News/Marco Rubio/Ted Cruz version of events.  You have to do the work yourself.  Those guys are usually either wrong on the facts or just plain lying.

With all due respect, I suspect the latter.

Godspeed, Mr. Scalia.  I wish I could say you served us well.

Jeb! was unenthusiastic from the get.  Trump had that one right, Jeb! lacks oomph.  If you're trying to get people to support your candidacy, the very least you can do is act like you're excited about it.

Jeb! reminds me of a girl at a fraternity "pig party," where the object is to see who can bring the ugliest girl to the party.  Jeb! looks like he just realized why his date won.

He's like a guy who lost his advertising job and found himself greeting shoppers at a Walmart in Kentucky.

Reluctantly throwing his hat into the ring, Jeb! couldn't seem to define the nature of his candidacy or what it was he wanted to accomplish.  He had nothing to say until he started answering a few of Trump's verbal jabs.

The first question Jeb! faced, one he should have anticipated for the last seven years, was whether or not he thought his brother, GW Bush made the right choice invading Iraq.

The question was phrased very specifically and gave Jeb! the gift of something his brother didn't have, hindsight.

The question was, knowing what we know now, would he still support the invasion of Iraq.  It was a leading question, giving Jeb! the benefit of twelve years of history upon which to base his response.

He wasn't even asked if would have made that decision with only the knowledge we had back in 2003.  Jeb! was asked to make that decision with full knowledge that there were no weapons of mass destruction, that the fall of Saddam Hussein would lead to the rise of ISIS and that an invasion of Iraq would lead to an interminable military entanglement.

After three days of deliberation, Jeb! proclaimed his support of his brother's decision. Apparently, blood is thicker than common sense.

Another of Jeb's heroic figures turns out to be Michigan Governor, Rick Snyder.  Jeb! says he admires the way Snyder took responsibility for the water problem in Flint.  In case you haven't heard about it, you can read about it <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/health/toxic-tap-water-flint-michigan/">here</a>.

Snyder taking responsibility for poisoning the water in Flint, Michigan is like Hitler taking responsibility for the Holocaust.  Of course he's responsible, he did it.

First, Snyder declared a State of Emergency in Flint, allowing the State of Michigan to take control away from Flint's elected officials.  That miracle was brought to you by the (Republican) geniuses in the Michigan legislature

Then they switched Flint's water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River and sold the supply pipes to a private vendor.

70 miles from America's Great Lakes and nothing but toxic water coming from every faucet in Flint, MI.  Even <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/10/gm.html">General Motors refused to use the water from the Flint River</a> because it was corroding engine parts.

And that, my friends is who Jeb! Bush admires.  Some aspiration for a presidential candidate.

We're not even going to mentioned Mama Bush (Barbara) being called in to defend her son against The Donald's onslaught.  We're not going to mention that when first asked, she said that she "thought Jeb! <em>might</em> make a good president."

Not exactly a ringing endorsement from your mother.

We're going to wind up here with Jeb's latest ad campaign, first previewed up there in New Hampshire.  (Raise your hand if you can point to New Hampshire on a map)

Jeb's newest campaign shows him with his brother, George, who reassures us that Jeb! will keep America safe.

A man considered to be one of the worst presidents ever, who presided over both the attack on 9/11 and one of the worst recessions in our history, a man who started two wars with no exit strategy, who did more to destabilize the Middle East than any terrorist organization you can name and can not pronounce the word "nuclear" is telling us that his brother will keep us safe.

What happened, Clint Eastwood refuse to make the pitch?

To his credit, Rubio seemed better able to control his dry mouth this year, but the lip smacking is still pretty off putting.  Hopefully, AstraZeneca has a pill for that.

If you're not a hard core political junkie, you can look at Rubio's victory speech this way;  it was equivalent to Benedict Cumberbatch giving an acceptance speech for the Best Actor award at last year's Academy Awards (Eddie Redmayne won).

Rubio's jubilation seemed out of place for a third place finish.  It was almost as if he was surprised that anyone at all voted for him.  Someone on his staff should've told Rubio that he was beat out by a guy who had never had his name on any ballot, anywhere, ever.

Rubio's speech began, "So this is the moment they said would never happen.  For months, for months they told us we had no chance."

That was a bad start.  Pundits from MSNBC to CNN to Fox News have all been predicting a Rubio surge for months.  We can chalk that up to youthful inexperience.  A more seasoned politician knows how to bury lies amidst smidgens of truth.

Rubio went on to say, "...the people of this great state have sent a very clear message. After seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back. "

This one's a real head scratcher.  It sounds like Rubio's saying something big here, but I can't, for the life of me figure out what.

Consider the following:
1.  Everyone who cast a vote in the Iowa Republican caucus was a Republican.
2.  All of Rubio's opponents in the Iowa Republican caucus were Republicans
3.  Barack Obama was not represented on the floor of any of the Iowa Republican caucuses.

How then, did any of Rubio's 43,165 votes say anything about Barack Obama or taking our country back?  (It's never clear exactly who is doing the taking and from whom they are taking it.)

I get that Rubio is trying to tie Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama, but he acts like he's running against the President, not the former First Lady.

That strategy worked pretty well in the 2008 election because tying the Republican candidates to the dismal presidency of G.W. Bush was both easy and deadly.

It remains to be seen if tying Hillary Clinton to a presidency that, by all metrics and benchmarks was successful, especially one that succeeded a worldwide economic collapse.

Either way, those 43,165 votes weren't cast against Barack Obama, they were cast against Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, et cetera.

Heck, with that lineup, it's pretty easy to cast a vote against any of them.  Two of the eleven who participated in the Iowa Republican caucus should be euthanized on general principles.

Most of the speech is a mish mash of 2nd Amendment fear mongering, Divine selection, military machismo and carefully crafted biographic mumbo jumbo.

Rubio's speech is also peppered with code phrases and conflicted images like, "...families struggling to raise their children with the right values."  What are the "right values" and who makes that call?

He talks about the president defending the Constitution, but has made it clear that God's law is above man's law.  In other words, he'll defend the Constitution when it suits his religious views.

Rubio, like many of his cohorts are quick to assert "that our rights come from our creator."  While there is a constitutional reference to "the Creator" as being the source of our rights, the president should only be concerned with those rights conferred upon us by the Constitution itself and clarified by justices charged with interpreting the Founders words.

Even when those rights conflict with her personal, religious beliefs.  Enforcing fundamental interpretations of God's law is best left to those most qualified, like the Supreme Leader of Iran and the Taliban.

Donald Trump reprised his role as birther by questioning Ted Cruz's eligibility to be president, just as he did with Barack Obama.

In case you haven't heard, Ted Cruz was born in Canada.

I question Marco Rubio's eligibility to be president, and not because his parents didn't become citizens until after little baby Marco was born.  (What, you didn't know that Marco was an anchor baby?)

I question Marco Rubio's eligibility to be president because I'm not sure on what planet he was born.

To his credit, Rubio seemed better able to control his dry mouth this year, but the lip smacking is still pretty off putting.  Hopefully, AstraZeneca has a pill for that.

If you're not a hard core political junkie, you can look at Rubio's victory speech this way;  it was equivalent to Benedict Cumberbatch giving an acceptance speech for the Best Actor award at last year's Academy Awards (Eddie Redmayne won).

Rubio's jubilation seemed out of place for a third place finish.  It was almost as if he was surprised that anyone at all voted for him.  Someone on his staff should've told Rubio that he was beat out by a guy who had never had his name on any ballot, anywhere, ever.

Rubio's speech began, "So this is the moment they said would never happen.  For months, for months they told us we had no chance."

That was a bad start.  Pundits from MSNBC to CNN to Fox News have all been predicting a Rubio surge for months.  We can chalk that up to youthful inexperience.  A more seasoned politician knows how to bury lies amidst smidgens of truth.

Rubio went on to say, "...the people of this great state have sent a very clear message. After seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back. "

This one's a real head scratcher.  It sounds like Rubio's saying something big here, but I can't, for the life of me figure out what.

Consider the following:
1.  Everyone who cast a vote in the Iowa Republican caucus was a Republican.
2.  All of Rubio's opponents in the Iowa Republican caucus were Republicans
3.  Barack Obama was not represented on the floor of any of the Iowa Republican caucuses.

How then, did any of Rubio's 43,165 votes say anything about Barack Obama or taking our country back?  (It's never clear exactly who is doing the taking and from whom they are taking it.)

I get that Rubio is trying to tie Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama, but he acts like he's running against the President, not the former First Lady.

That strategy worked pretty well in the 2008 election because tying the Republican candidates to the dismal presidency of G.W. Bush was both easy and deadly.

It remains to be seen if tying Hillary Clinton to a presidency that, by all metrics and benchmarks was successful, especially one that succeeded a worldwide economic collapse.

Either way, those 43,165 votes weren't cast against Barack Obama, they were cast against Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, et cetera.

Heck, with that lineup, it's pretty easy to cast a vote against any of them.  Two of the eleven who participated in the Iowa Republican caucus should be euthanized on general principles.

Most of the speech is a mish mash of 2nd Amendment fear mongering, Divine selection, military machismo and carefully crafted biographic mumbo jumbo.

Rubio's speech is also peppered with code phrases and conflicted images like, "...families struggling to raise their children with the right values."  What are the "right values" and who makes that call?

He talks about the president defending the Constitution, but has made it clear that God's law is above man's law.  In other words, he'll defend the Constitution when it suits his religious views.

Rubio, like many of his cohorts are quick to assert "that our rights come from our creator."  While there is a constitutional reference to "the Creator" as being the source of our rights, the president should only be concerned with those rights conferred upon us by the Constitution itself and clarified by justices charged with interpreting the Founders words.

Even when those rights conflict with her personal, religious beliefs.  Enforcing fundamental interpretations of God's law is best left to those most qualified, like the Supreme Leader of Iran and the Taliban.

Donald Trump reprised his role as birther by questioning Ted Cruz's eligibility to be president, just as he did with Barack Obama.

In case you haven't heard, Ted Cruz was born in Canada.

I question Marco Rubio's eligibility to be president, and not because his parents didn't become citizens until after little baby Marco was born.  (What, you didn't know that Marco was an anchor baby?)

I question Marco Rubio's eligibility to be president because I'm not sure on what planet he was born.

As it turns out, the writer is not a bad person and much brighter than one might conclude having read The Paragraph, which was rife with every manner of writing error.

One of Donald Trump's strengths is that his speeches are in plain, no-frills English.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing even semi-intelligent sounding, but he gets his point across.

It's easy to fall into the trap of trying to "dress to impress" when writing.  Fancy words don't have any impact if they're used incorrectly.

Words, like numbers have meanings.  If you say, "The weather is really beating on Seattle," you're not really saying much about what's going on in Seattle.  Could be a heat wave, could be a blizzard.  Weather is whatever is going on outside your window; rain, snow, the Santa Ana winds or the longest heat wave on record.

Punctuation can be a potent tool, but correct capitalization shows you've got a grasp of your task.  Sometimes the word "president" is capitalized, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes there's an apostrophe before the "s" in the word "it's," sometimes there isn't.

If you're unsure about any of the above, there's plenty of places to look, including <a href="http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/commas.asp">this one</a>.  Spend some time, familiarize yourself with the intricacies of our magnificent language.  You'll be a better writer for it.

These are the kinds of things that will make your writing more impressive, even erudite, if that's what you're going for.  Oops, is that a dangling preposition?

He's so in love with his poll numbers that he bragged about being able to randomly shoot people on 5th Avenue (New York) without fear of losing any support.

Not very promising for a greater America.  Not very presidential, either.

Trump has said nothing new - nothing sane and new, anyway - and has offered no solutions within the realm of feasibility.  This piece, however is not about Trump, but I would like to say one more thing about him.

While in Iowa this weekend, The Donald stayed at a Holiday Inn Express in Sioux Falls on Friday night and then attended church services on Sunday in Muscatine.

About the Holiday Inn Express, Trump acknowledged, “Good mattress, staff was great, good mattress, good everything.”

Must've been a great mattress (he mentioned it twice), but I'm not sure this would qualify as a cogent Yelp.

At Muscatine’s First Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Dr. Pamela Saturnia focused on humility and inclusion, two things notably absent from The Donald's repertoire.

Pastor Saturnia specifically mentioned Syrian refugees and Mexican migrants.

Commenting on the pastor's sermon, Trump said, “I don’t know if that was aimed at me … perhaps."

<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carlysimon/youresovain.html">He's so vain</a>, but he doesn't think the sermon was about him, did he? Did he?

I know, that was self indulgent.  Sorry, but billionaires aren't as great as we think they're going to be once they get into government.  Here in Illinois, we have a billionaire governor and he's making <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/neil-steinberg/7/71/1267941/bruce-rauner-does-imposs">Rod Blagojevich look good</a>.

Anyway, America's broken and there isn't anything that Donald Trump or any of the other candidates can do about it.  We're still a great country but, a little broken.  America is fun, as in dys<strong>fun</strong>ctional.

There's two main impediments to meaningful change.  One is that we don't have the political will to do it, either among our elected officials or our voters.  We would need to fire all those guys (senators, congressmen, etc) and start over.

The other reason is that for all their talk about making it better, America is a pretty great place to be for guys like Donald Trump.  Our motto should be, "America, we know how to treat the rich."

America is plagued by a laundry list of problems, including a bloated bureaucracy, undue corporate influence, lobbyists gone wild, out-of-control spending on antiquated defense hardware, exploding health care costs, super-entitled lawmakers, crumbling infrastructure, and so forth.

Today I'd like to chat a little about what I call "Campaign ad nauseum."

Most of the evils embedded in the American experiment are embodied in our elections themselves.  At the heart of it all is the black hole of humanity, M-O-N-E-Y.

"<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/moneythatswhatiwant.html"><em>Money don't get everything it's true, What it don't get I can't use</em></a>."

With election 2016 both boring and boring down on us, we've been barraged, harangued and generally assaulted on a daily basis for more than a year, the end barely in sight.  In what will be a two year campaign, an estimated $5 Billion will be spent.

No matter who gets elected, I don't see how it would be possible for anyone to think that it will be worth it.  That it will be money well spent.

Our elections drag on interminably and suffer undue influence from all the wrong people.  Vast amounts are spent to seduce the gullible into voting against their own best interests.  I'm not going to say which side is most guilty of that particular offense.

It might be described as paradoxical that one party spends exorbitant sums of money to influence voters and almost as much trying to limit who gets to vote.

Here are some things that might interest you:

- <em>The longest campaign in Canadian history was 10 weeks.</em>
- <em>In the U.K., political parties can only spend $30 million in the year before an election</em>.
- <em>In Germany, political parties release just one 90-second television ad</em>.
- <em>In 2013, over two-thirds of income to Norway's political parties came from the government</em>.
- <em>Voter registration is automatic in Sweden.</em>
- <em>In Australia, voting is compulsory</em>.
-<em> In Brazil, Election Day is on the weekend</em>.

The internet can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the way elections work around the world.  If you're so inclined, you can start <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/">here</a>.

As we say here in Chicago:  "Vote early and vote often."

He's so in love with his poll numbers that he bragged about being able to randomly shoot people on 5th Avenue (New York) without fear of losing any support.

Not very promising for a greater America.  Not very presidential, either.

Trump has said nothing new - nothing sane and new, anyway - and has offered no solutions within the realm of feasibility.  This piece, however is not about Trump, but I would like to say one more thing about him.

While in Iowa this weekend, The Donald stayed at a Holiday Inn Express in Sioux Falls on Friday night and then attended church services on Sunday in Muscatine.

About the Holiday Inn Express, Trump acknowledged, “Good mattress, staff was great, good mattress, good everything.”

Must've been a great mattress (he mentioned it twice), but I'm not sure this would qualify as a cogent Yelp.

At Muscatine’s First Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Dr. Pamela Saturnia focused on humility and inclusion, two things notably absent from The Donald's repertoire.

Pastor Saturnia specifically mentioned Syrian refugees and Mexican migrants.

Commenting on the pastor's sermon, Trump said, “I don’t know if that was aimed at me … perhaps."

<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carlysimon/youresovain.html">He's so vain</a>, but he doesn't think the sermon was about him, did he? Did he?

I know, that was self indulgent.  Sorry, but billionaires aren't as great as we think they're going to be once they get into government.  Here in Illinois, we have a billionaire governor and he's making <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/neil-steinberg/7/71/1267941/bruce-rauner-does-imposs">Rod Blagojevich look good</a>.

Anyway, America's broken and there isn't anything that Donald Trump or any of the other candidates can do about it.  We're still a great country but, a little broken.  America is fun, as in dys<strong>fun</strong>ctional.

There's two main impediments to meaningful change.  One is that we don't have the political will to do it, either among our elected officials or our voters.  We would need to fire all those guys (senators, congressmen, etc) and start over.

The other reason is that for all their talk about making it better, America is a pretty great place to be for guys like Donald Trump.  Our motto should be, "America, we know how to treat the rich."

America is plagued by a laundry list of problems, including a bloated bureaucracy, undue corporate influence, lobbyists gone wild, out-of-control spending on antiquated defense hardware, exploding health care costs, super-entitled lawmakers, crumbling infrastructure, and so forth.

Today I'd like to chat a little about what I call "Campaign ad nauseum."

Most of the evils embedded in the American experiment are embodied in our elections themselves.  At the heart of it all is the black hole of humanity, M-O-N-E-Y.

"<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/moneythatswhatiwant.html"><em>Money don't get everything it's true, What it don't get I can't use</em></a>."

With election 2016 both boring and boring down on us, we've been barraged, harangued and generally assaulted on a daily basis for more than a year, the end barely in sight.  In what will be a two year campaign, an estimated $5 Billion will be spent.

No matter who gets elected, I don't see how it would be possible for anyone to think that it will be worth it.  That it will be money well spent.

Our elections drag on interminably and suffer undue influence from all the wrong people.  Vast amounts are spent to seduce the gullible into voting against their own best interests.  I'm not going to say which side is most guilty of that particular offense.

It might be described as paradoxical that one party spends exorbitant sums of money to influence voters and almost as much trying to limit who gets to vote.

Here are some things that might interest you:

- <em>The longest campaign in Canadian history was 10 weeks.</em>
- <em>In the U.K., political parties can only spend $30 million in the year before an election</em>.
- <em>In Germany, political parties release just one 90-second television ad</em>.
- <em>In 2013, over two-thirds of income to Norway's political parties came from the government</em>.
- <em>Voter registration is automatic in Sweden.</em>
- <em>In Australia, voting is compulsory</em>.
-<em> In Brazil, Election Day is on the weekend</em>.

The internet can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the way elections work around the world.  If you're so inclined, you can start <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/24/world/global-campaign-finance/">here</a>.

As we say here in Chicago:  "Vote early and vote often."

Penn's interview with Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, entitled, "<em>El Chapo Speaks, A secret visit with the most wanted man in the world"</em> leaves little doubt as to the subject of that piece.  The byline (by Sean Penn) at the top of the page is a hint at whom might be the supporting actor, although who supports whom is debatable throughout.

You can read Penn's article <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/el-chapo-speaks-20160109?page=5">here</a>.

In an interview with Charlie Rose on CBS's 60 Minutes, Penn complained that his article failed to start the conversation he had in mind.  The problem, according to Penn is the state of journalism, and he wasn't talking about New Jersey, or any of the other 49 states.

According to Penn, there is a problem with journalism that only he, Penn is able to understand.

Human creativity has allowed for the continued advancement of civilization, but some of the ways people deflect blame can be truly amazing.

Sarah Palin says that her son, Track's arrest on domestic violence charges is a result of his being misunderstood by the President of the United States.  Mrs. Palin did not say who was responsible for her entire family being involved in a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/09/sarah-palin-party-police-report-fighting-brawl/16983451/">drunken brawl</a> back in 2014.

Penn's creativity allowed him to shift blame for his very poorly received article from the author (himself) to every journalist in America.  In his mind, the failure of his article is because they (journalists) are not doing their job properly.

"My article should not have made this much noise," he told Charlie Rose. "El Chapo should not have been this popular a figure to read about."

The first question that pops to mind is, why, if he didn't want his article to make noise did Penn give it to Rolling Stone?  Penn is, after all a movie star and his article was about the most notorious drug lord in the world.

Common sense might dictate that there was going to be some attention given to that article, showing up in Rolling Stone and all.

The part about El Chapo being too popular a figure to read about is a head scratcher.  If El Chapo wasn't such a looming figure in popular culture, why did Penn go through excruciating, dangerous machinations just to get a selfie with him?

Perhaps Sean Penn never saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/ ">Scarface</a> and doesn't realize the popular attraction of violent psychopaths.

Penn goes on to tell Rose, "I can get angry—like many people can. I'm really sad about the state of journalism in our country," he said. "It has been an incredible hypocrisy and an incredible lesson in just how much they don't know and how <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/disserved by the press">disserved</a> we are."

I'll leave that one to the reader to dissect.  I'm not sure why critics panning Penn's article is hypocritical or how we are being disserved.  Typically, they just report on the things that interest us.  Things like a fugitive, mass murdering drug lord.

In a final to shot to journalism, Penn says, "Again, journalists who want to say that I'm not a journalist. Well, I want to see the license that says that they're a journalist."

Personally, I'm not that discerning.  I figure, if someone's getting paid to do journalism and they've got the credentials, that's good enough for me.  Even if they work for TMZ or Entertainment Tonight.

If, however I was getting paid to write this drivel, I'd be tempted to ask Mr. Penn if I could see his actor's license.

<em>The following was originally posted on January 21, 2013</em>:

Michelle Obama was reinstated as First Lady yesterday, as her husband was sworn in for his second term as President of the United States in a small ceremony officiated by Chief Justice John Roberts.  Joe Biden was  sworn in for his second term as Vice President by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

The Constitution mandates the ceremony take place on January 20 and this was only the 7th time it occurred on a Sunday. The public inauguration, expected to draw about 600K people (as opposed to about 1.8 M in 2008) will take place today.

The two terms of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will be as different as the men themselves and their political affiliations. Yet, these two very different men have much in common, something worth considering.

Both are reviled and ridiculed by the "other side".  Both seem to be sincerely loyal Americans, in that they seem to believe in America and her people.

Both Bush and Obama are exemplary family men with adoring wives and two charming daughters.  They both seem to uphold most of our American ideals and both seem to have avoided the personal potholes that have derailed countless political careers and have become emblematic of the American political system.

From all appearances, they are both role models for the American family.

Even if Barack Hussein Obama was not your choice for president, you should take heart in the knowledge that his re-election and the seamless continuation of the American presidency is a testament to the dream our Founding Fathers called the United States of America and to this experiment we call democracy.

Congress is broken, but as long we maintain faith in ourselves and encourage the broadest possible participation in America, we have the power to make it better.

Happy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  He had a dream and it was mostly about you being able to pursue yours.

Happy birthday, Dr. King.

<em>The following was originally posted on January 21, 2013</em>:

Michelle Obama was reinstated as First Lady yesterday, as her husband was sworn in for his second term as President of the United States in a small ceremony officiated by Chief Justice John Roberts.  Joe Biden was  sworn in for his second term as Vice President by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

The Constitution mandates the ceremony take place on January 20 and this was only the 7th time it occurred on a Sunday. The public inauguration, expected to draw about 600K people (as opposed to about 1.8 M in 2008) will take place today.

The two terms of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will be as different as the men themselves and their political affiliations. Yet, these two very different men have much in common, something worth considering.

Both are reviled and ridiculed by the "other side".  Both seem to be sincerely loyal Americans, in that they seem to believe in America and her people.

Both Bush and Obama are exemplary family men with adoring wives and two charming daughters.  They both seem to uphold most of our American ideals and both seem to have avoided the personal potholes that have derailed countless political careers and have become emblematic of the American political system.

From all appearances, they are both role models for the American family.

Even if Barack Hussein Obama was not your choice for president, you should take heart in the knowledge that his re-election and the seamless continuation of the American presidency is a testament to the dream our Founding Fathers called the United States of America and to this experiment we call democracy.

Congress is broken, but as long we maintain faith in ourselves and encourage the broadest possible participation in America, we have the power to make it better.

Happy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  He had a dream and it was mostly about you being able to pursue yours.

Happy birthday, Dr. King.

<em>"Listening to the State of the Union address last night <span style="color: #ff0000;">with Obama</span> one would feel that everything in America is as rosy as can be. But <span style="color: #ff0000;">realty</span> set in on the stock market today.

Fracking is what kept our economy up. Our economy would have suffered a <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>depression<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span> instead of a recession.  Today the stock market dropped over 364 points; this year to date -1300 pt. sell off is over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">expected 10% general corrections</span> in a market.   2/3 of the S&amp;P stocks <span style="color: #ff0000;">is</span> in bear territory. Hold on to your hats cause here we go again!"</em>

Regarding The Paragraph, some of you have already commented on things like syntax, spelling, composition, content, the quotation marks on "depression" and the apostrophe in the word, "company's," but none of that is germane to this discussion.

It's definitely not germane that the writer probably did not listen to the address with Obama, as The Paragraph seems to indicate.

I don't know the provenance of The Paragraph, but I suspect that somebody was eager to post it without proofreading it.  In the mind of that writer, it was a shot at the President and some of us seem all too eager to take that shot.  Metaphorically speaking, of course.

The State of the Union (SOTU) generally starts out with the president saying something about the state of the Union being strong.  The modifier varies, sometimes they say, "stronger" or "strongest" or other words to that effect.

In the case of last Tuesday's SOTU, President Obama finished his address by saying that the state of the Union was strong.  Other than that, it was pretty standard State of the Union stuff.

It's the president's job to give Congress an account of the state of the Union and a little bit of a pep talk, as well.  It's the job of the opposing party to say that the president was lying and that things are much worse than he's telling us.

That is about the one and only job that Republicans seem to take seriously these days.

The routine has been pretty much the same for the last couple hundred years, but there have been exceptions.

Back in 1860, four months before the beginning of the Civil War, James Buchanan declared that <em>“the Union of the States, which is the source of all these blessings, is threatened with destruction.”</em>

During the 1975 recession, Gerald Ford admitted: <em>“I must say to you that the state of the Union is not good: Millions of Americans are out of work. Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more. Prices are too high, and sales are too slow.”</em>

Personally, I found President Obama's version much more appealing.  I don't need anyone telling me what I can see out my window or by watching cable news.

Following the remarks about the President painting a picture of America as "<em>rosy as can be</em>," The Paragraph tosses in a bunch of stuff about the stock market, oil companies and fracking.  While most of it is inaccurate, it's typical of the Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ted Cruz, Tea Party approach.

Put the President's name in a bucket, throw in a bunch of bad stuff and see what sticks.  Do it often enough and pretty soon he's wearing all those crazy stickers.

The president is not your stock picker or financial adviser.  Don't rely on him to tell you what the stock market is doing or expect that he's going to have any great influence on it.

In modern times, the economy has done better under Democrats than Republicans.  That's a <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lucky-or-not-the-economy-does-better-under-democrats-2015-10-27">fact</a>.  Anyone want to go back to 2008?

If however, you blame President Obama for the current instability in the stock market, then you have to give him credit for an unprecedented (that means it never happened before) six year bull market that saw index levels triple, crushing previous highs.

You have to give him credit for an unprecedented (still means it never happened before) 70 months of job growth and cutting unemployment in half.

None of that, though is his job.  The only thing the president swears to at his inauguration is to uphold the Constitution.  That means, if the Supreme Court says that two men can marry, then that's the law of the land.

To say that <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120873/fracking-creates-jobs-how-many">fracking kept the economy up</a> is just plain ridiculous.  It doesn't merit discussion.  The month that President Obama took office saw 750,000 jobs lost.  That's probably more than all the people employed in fracking and support industries at that time.

You can read more about fracking <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-board-tirade/2016/01/fracking-greed-planet/">here</a>.

Arguably, it was the bailout of General Motors that stopped the economic implosion.  You can thank GW Bush for that one.  The stimulus packages probably helped a bit, as well.

Neither does the difference between recession and depression merit discussion.  The measurements of expansion, contraction and time frames are mind numbing.  Economists illustrate it like this:  "When your neighbor loses his job, it's a recession.  When you lose your job, it's a depression."

Governor Cuomo banned fracking in New York last year because of the negative impact it has on the environment and on the health of local residents.  In other states, new wells have been put on hold because it's no longer a profitable enterprise.  At $30 a barrel for oil, there isn't enough profit to drill new wells or to operate the costly extraction process of fracking.

The Paragraph, I think is trying to link President Obama to the problems of the oil industry, but that's just a matter of supply and demand.  There is a worldwide glut of oil (oversupply) and demand is down from the days when China was building city after city in preparation for an urban migration that never occurred.

As far as The Paragraph's stock market analysis, it's a wee bit jumbled.   First of all, a correction is a price slide from recent highs, not from all time highs.  As of the time The Paragraph was written, the market was only down about 8%.

Either way, it's only a guideline, nothing is written in stone.  Valuations in the stock market are at levels never seen before the middle of 2015, so fluctuations are liable to be severe.

I don't know what the thing about 2/3 of the oil companies closing means, but I don't think it's likely.  Either way, I don't get the point.

When oil was $100 a barrel, it was the President's fault.  Everyone knows that oil prices soar under black presidents.  Now oil's $30 a barrel and that's his fault, too.  Well, everyone knows that oil prices plummet under black presidents.

My car needs a new transmission and I don't think it's a coincidence that both my car and the President are black.

During the 2012 GOP primary, Newt Gingrich promised to bring gasoline prices down to $2.50 a gallon, so that must've been a good thing for a presidential candidate to promise, right?  Do we thank Newt Gingrich or President Obama now that gasoline is under $2.00 a gallon in most of the country.

The President was unequivocally right about one thing.  The American economy is the strongest and most durable in the world.  Whatever's happening on Wall Street is nothing like what happened in 2008.

Corporate America is in good shape, not that they're willing to share any of those massive, unprecedented (there's that word again) piles of cash they're sitting on.

If you want to listen to the Glenn Becks of the world, crying about how terrible everything is, and all because of the black man in the White House, that is your prerogative.

I love the sight of Old Glory rippling in the wind.  l choke up when I hear the National Anthem (unless it's being sung by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=roseanne+sings+national+anthem&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Roseanne</a>).

I am one American who is happy to hear that the state of the Union is strong.

That doesn't sound too bad.  Commercials extolling the beauty of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) almost make it seem like a good thing.

Take a minute, though.  If you think that pumping toxic chemicals into the ground under high pressure is without consequences, you are operating significantly below the human potential for critical thought.

If "they" tell you that it is harmless to the environment, they are lying.  Remember when "they" told the town of Flint, MI that it was safe to drink the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/15/health/flint-michigan-water-crisis/">water from the Flint River</a>?

Weren't we content just spewing contaminants upward, into the atmosphere?  Almost makes me long for the good old days, when sex was dirty and air was clean.

Out in Colorado I saw a commercial for fracking that featured a woman who said that without allowing fracking on her land, her farm would not be profitable.  Two things immediately jumped out at me:

1.  If you pay somebody enough money, they'll say anything
2.  That woman must be a lousy farmer

While it's nice that an oil company is willing to subsidize that farmer's income, it comes at a very steep price.

From fracking liquid spills to infiltration of aquifers (ground water) and increased seismic activity (earthquakes), fracking is doing irreparable harm to an increasingly fragile planet.  The Earth and its surrounding atmosphere can not absorb every single pollutant man can invent.

You can read about some of that <a href="http://www.alternet.org/environment/8-dangerous-side-effects-fracking-industry-doesnt-want-you-hear-about">here</a>.

Whenever you're in doubt about an issue, follow the money.  Who gains the most from fracking, who has nothing at all to gain by restricting it?  Nothing at all, except for a livable planet to bequeath our children and their children.

It's great that fracking creates jobs, but a lot of those jobs are going to low wage, undocumented workers.  Just because we can create a job, doesn't mean that we should.

Some people find employment clubbing baby seals to death for their pelts.  Should that be a protected industry because it creates jobs?  We could create jobs here by allowing <a href="http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/fur/chinese-fur-industry/">dogs to be used for fur</a>, like they do in China.  Where do I sign up for that?

One last thought before we leave the fracking thing behind.  It's great to make natural gas abundant, but it also binds us even tighter to fossil fuels as a resource, discouraging development of alternative fuels.  At some point, fossil fuels will run out.

In the next installment, we discuss the following paragraph, which someone sent me after Tuesday's State of the Union address.  It is not edited for either content or composition.  This is a <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-board-tirade/2016/01/state-union-obama/">link</a> to that discussion:

<em>"Listening to the State of the Union address last night with Obama one would feel that everything in America is as rosy as can be. But realty set in on the stock market today. Between 1/3 to 2/3 of American crude oil company's can close and that I'll put thousands of people out of a job. Fracking is what kept our economy up. Our economy would have suffered a "depression" instead of a recession.</em>  <em></em><em>Today the stock market dropped over 364 points; this year to date -1300 pt. sell off is over the expected 10% general corrections in a market.   2/3 of the S&amp;P stocks is in bear territory.
