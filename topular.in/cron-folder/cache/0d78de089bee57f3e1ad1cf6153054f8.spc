So when 2015-16 high school basketball schedule was announced, the buzz must have started at Fenwick High School, where students, administrators and alumni saw that their beloved Friars would be hosting the State’s most prominent team, the Simeon Wolverines on the afternoon of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, January 18, 2016.

With temperatures below zero, more than a thousand basketball fans, from young kids to older alumni, poured into the Fenwick gym with late arrivals turned away, the capacity reached.

This was a big game. The two most prominent high school basketball reporters, Michael O’Brien of the Sun-Times and Mike Helfgot of the Tribune, were seated courtside.  WCIU-TV’s play-by-play man Jim Blaney and commentator, Kenny McReynolds, were center court to call all the action live.

This was a big deal, a big game.  The Friars are no pushover. They are the fourth ranked team in the State and beat Bogan earlier in the year in double-overtime at the Proviso West Holiday Tournament. Simeon is ranked third with only two losses, one to the State’s top-seed Morgan Park and the other to Curie at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament.  The Friars also only had two losses, to Morgan Park in the championship at the Proviso West Holiday Tournament followed by a loss to rival Benet Academy.  The team established credibility knocking off two Public League powerhouses in Whitney Young and Bogan.

Having watched the Friars play at the Proviso West, I was well aware that they were stacked with talent, led by senior point guard Mike Smith, junior Jacob Keller and sophomore A.J. Nixon. But they also are very well coached by Rich Malnati and his staff and every single Friar player that walks on the court knows the offense, defense and brings an energy and commitment to each play. There were no intimidated Friars to be seen. They were ready to play from the jump ball and with every seat in the gym taken along with all of the standing room viewing areas, electricity filled the gym and expectations were high for a great game. Simeon and Fenwick did not disappoint. 

Mike Smith started the scoring quickly and it seemed with every drive or outside shot, he could not be stopped. With each basket, the Friars faithful cheered loudly, a surround-sound of support for each great play.  Simeon’s senior star Zack Norvell led the attack for the Wolverines with help from lightning-quick point guard Evan Gilyard. Norvell is a knock-down outside shooter, but also a tremendous athlete who will take his talents to Gonzaga next year.  In the first half, each time the Friars pulled away, Norvell and his teammates would close the gap.

Fenwick’s head coach, Malnati, unleashed the 1-3-1 defense against Simeon in the second quarter, a tactic he used against Bogan quite successfully. This defense takes the opposing team out of attack mode as they are forced to quickly move the ball from side to side with good crisp passes or they turn the ball over. At the half with the score close, smiles filled the faces of the Friar faithful, especially the very energetic student section, as they realized their team could win this game. Everyone looked happy, excited at the thought of winning, as they watched their talented cheerleaders do backflips across the gym and dance team take the floor for a very polished and well-performed presentation.

When the second half started, Malnati went to a 2-3 zone defense and it worked fairly well as his team took the lead, going up by 10 at one point.  The Friar's Smith was once again unstoppable and the Wolverines Norvell picked up his pace and energy as he realized they could lose the game, if he didn’t take it over. Both Norvell and Gilyard would score on drives and outside shots as their teammates, especially Josh Thomas, picked up their intensity to force turnovers in the fourth quarter that turned the momentum in favor of Simeon, as a stunned look crossed the collective faces of the Friar faithful.

With 22 seconds on the clock and Simeon leading 67-66, Smith dribbled quickly up the right side for the Friars and pulled up outside the arc, pump-faked, then went up for a jumpshot, crashing into Simeon sophomore Talen Horton Tucker, an NBA move that most high school and college refs won’t call - especially when it may determine the winner of the game.  But in the Fenwick gymnasium, the ref blew the whistle and gave Smith three foul shots.  There was no doubt in my mind the ultra-talented Smith, who should be considered for Illinois Mr. Basketball, would sink all three and put Fenwick up 69-67. He did.

Trying to answer, Gilyard came flying down the middle of the court, drove the lane and a foul was called.  One of Simeon’s best freethrow shooters, Gilyard sank the first one and it looked like the game was going to overtime. With Fenwick fans collective breath held, and eyeballs wide throughout the gym, Gilyard’s second freethrow missed badly to the left. As the ball came down, Fenwick pulled down the rebound and Nixon was fouled. He sank both freethrows to cap the win at 71-68 as the horn sounded and the student section emptied onto the court to congratulate their schoolmates, including Smith who finished with 38 points and Nixon with 12.  Simeon’s Norvell finished with 25, Gilyard 19 and Thomas 14.

As the fans filed out of the gym with happy faces, there is no doubt that this MLK Day will be remembered by the Friar faithful for years to come. And high school basketball in Chicago continues to be a cheap ticket and really fun experience.

When Stephen Colbert took over the hot seat from Mr. David Letterman on September 8 of 2015, there was no smooth, seamless transition. It was out with the old and in with the new. As a big David Letterman fan since 1978, I believe ol’ Dave was night-in and night-out the funniest, most entertaining person on television since he launched <em>Late Night</em> on NBC in 1982 and then the <em>The Late Show</em> on CBS in 1993.  But Dave’s show ran its course and the last five years felt like the true King of Late Night was just going through the motions, while all of a sudden deciding to take political positions, something he hadn’t done over the first 26 years of his show. 
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/US-Obama-Mideast-Isra_Horo-3-e1363898256893-635x357.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/US-Obama-Mideast-Isra_Horo-3-e1363898256893-635x357-300x168.jpg" alt="US-Obama-Mideast-Isra_Horo-3-e1363898256893-635x357" width="300" height="168" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1316" /></a>

If you watched, you know there were no jokes about President Barack Obama during the entire first four years of the administration. It wasn’t until the second term that jokes about the President, a staple for late-night talk shows, were inserted into the monologue. Fat jokes about Chris Christie were also flying out of Dave’s mouth, a real no-no in this day and age of awareness for the life-threatening dangers of anorexia nervosa and bulimia. The clever monologue writer, Bill Scheft, wrote those inappropriate jokes, but Dave had to approve them and read them.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/01/Madonna-photo.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/01/Madonna-photo.jpg" alt="Madonna photo" width="179" height="119" class="alignright size-full wp-image-938" /></a>
Also, over the course of his three decades on the air, Dave was often called mean by some Hollywood celebrities who didn’t like his direct questions. Cher and Madonna led that criticism, but that wasn’t the reason for the change. The real inspiration was a drop in audience from 3.1 million in the 2012-2013 season to 2.8 million the following year. When the search began for a new host, <em>The Colbert Report</em> had the largest audience among adults 18-49 (April 2013), beating out Jay Leno and <em>The Tonight Show</em> for the first time. And Colbert’s appeal to college students and young men 18-34 meant CBS could put a new host in the hot seat who would bring in a built-in audience. 

The one wild card on the show was the format and how would Colbert fair as the real Stephen Colbert. Apparently, there was quite a bit of curiosity about this as the first show drew a whopping 6.6 million viewers. Yes, Stephen is now himself on <em>The Late Show</em>, but he is bringing an entire bag of success from <em>The Colbert Report</em>, most notably the first segment at the desk. 

Once Stephen sits at the desk, his very loyal core of fans are treated to the format that worked so well on <em>The Colbert Report</em>. He will usually address a political subject or news events with the photo of that subject or event coming on the screen to his right. For his fans, this is <em>The Colbert Report</em> continued, although Stephen is not presenting it with an attitude his CR character had delivered for nine years, mimicking the persona of <em>FOX News</em> star, Bill O’Reilly, with a character voice that is low, more assertive and authoritative. He presents it as the real Stephen Colbert, but it’s the same humor, the same wit, the same bit, so the fans know their comedy hero lives on and is now playing to a much larger audience with the potential to grow even bigger on the more accessible CBS Network.

There have been many memorable moments during that first segment, more than a few used Donald Trump. One of my favorites right out of the gate was when Colbert said, “Right after announcing he was running for President, Donald Trump called the Mexicans racists and John McCain a coward. Given that, his campaign slogan might as well be: Trump ’16, You’re Stupid and Ugly!”

For CR fans, that’s the comedy they expect to be served. However, they get a much bigger helping of the “ha ha” because now Stephen has the opportunity to show America his full repertoire including singing, dancing, his very funny characters performing in sketches, satirical smarts, silliness, wackiness and a level of energy which is incredible to see each night. 
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/498483942.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/498483942-199x300.jpg" alt="498483942" width="199" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1530" /></a>
One of the really silly bits he did was with the very smart, but very silly John Cleese. They were the men of big hats, which were visually silly, and then traded funny statements, making the bit look like it came right out of <em>Monty Python</em>. Great stuff! (Clip below)

His fans let him know each evening that they aren’t letting go of the love they have for <em>The Colbert Report</em> as they chant “Stephen! Stephen! reminiscent of the chants heard on <em>Comedy Central</em>.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/NBNvOuz.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/NBNvOuz-300x168.jpg" alt="NBNvOuz" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1524" /></a>

Over the past three months, the show and Stephen have continued to grow as he continues to present new segments, new characters, new bits. And here’s the major point: When you tune in to <em>The Late Show</em>, you don’t really have to check to see who will be on the show. All you have to know is that Stephen Colbert is the host. He takes every segment and every guest and keeps it interesting and funny. He is very aware of the attention span of America and keeps the pace moving. When a guest sits in that chair, they aren’t receiving the softball questions: How have you been? What’s new? What have you been up to? Nope, Stephen has the questions ready and delivers them with an energy that signals to the guests that they need to keep pace. Perhaps the only guest thus far who didn’t understand that was Bruce Willis, who paused and reflected before answering the question, leaving a gap that resulted in Stephen saying, “Should I get an egg timer?”  

Burt Reynolds was also a little slow with his response, but Stephen respectfully cut him some slack, given Reynolds age. Nonetheless, both were very funny segments.

Carly Simon remarked during the questions that his fast-paced interview-style helped her, because she struggles with a stutter and the pace helped her avoid stuttering, which she appreciated. Then, he asked her to sing a duet with him for the song, <em>Mockingbird</em>, which he very nicely sang the harmonies to Simon's incredible vocals. (Clip below)

He has introduced some really funny segments. <em>Big Questions with even Bigger Stars</em> with Tom Hanks was a gem of a bit; an absolutely hilarious sketch with James Bond actor Daniel Craig trying to rent a car may be the high point of hilarity on the show up until now. There was Stephen interviewing his long-time Second City pal, Steve Carell, and then singing a wonderful melodic duet with him. In <em>Hans Wars</em>, he pretended to be auditioning for the Hans Solo part for writer/director J.J. Abrams so Harrison Ford would decide to take the part. So funny!

Perhaps the best interview was with controversial HBO political talk show host, Bill Maher, who made it combative, but came out on the losing end of the verbal combat. He started it with, “I probably wouldn’t be invited to your dinner party, because we are very opposite.” Stephen was literally taken aback by the remark, shifting back in his chair and looking a bit surprised, but also realizing “it was on.” He quickly leaned back into Maher’s space and met the confrontation head on.  At one point, Colbert really made Maher look stupid after Maher misrepresented a statement made only seconds earlier as "a big lecture" by Colbert pressing him to return to the Church, as opposed to the polite invitation viewers witnessed. This was mono o mono, two big comedy giants throwing out the PC and letting the statements fly. Loved it! Great stuff! (Clip below)

Personally, I have only one issue with the show. They have made a definitive decision to present off-beat musical acts. Perhaps this appeals to the younger audience they are trying to attract. I am over 50 and a lover of alternative rock, but really any good music. For the majority of the acts Stephen introduces, that's when I turn the channel. 

There is so much that can be written about the unique blend of remarkable talent, interesting interviews, political debate with the candidates, silliness with the kings of laughter, and really creative sketches presented each evening. There is most certainly a major gap between the intelligent satirical comedy Colbert presents as opposed to the silly guy-at-the-party comedy Jimmy Fallon offers each night. I watched five of his shows and that was enough for me to stay away from NBC. So my recommendation is this: If you are someone who stays up to watch late night talk shows, or records them, watch five of Colbert's shows. If you’re not hooked by then, he’s not your brand of comedy. But for me and millions across this country, he has taken the seat of a comedy legend I loved and is now presenting an entirely new style of late night talk show that is much needed and appreciated.

There is most certainly a major gap between the intelligent satirical comedy Colbert presents as opposed to the silly guy-at-the-party comedy Jimmy Fallon offers each night. I watched five of his shows and that was enough for me to stay away from NBC. So my recommendation is this: If you are someone who stays up to watch late night talk shows, or records them, watch five of Colbert's shows. If you’re not hooked by then, he’s not your brand of comedy. But for me and millions across this country, he has taken the seat of a comedy legend I loved and is now presenting an entirely new style of late night talk show that is much needed and appreciated.

Good call by Les Moonves and David Letterman for hiring this Colbert fellow and making late night talk interesting and really funny again.

With those who had been directly affected by gun violence standing behind him and sitting in the chairs in front of him, he laid out his plea to America, citing the number of mass murders that have taken place since Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot outside a grocery store in Arizona on January 8, 2011. It was quite a long list and with each mention, I could remember watching the news of each event and the visible horror on the faces of the loved ones who had a family member of friend killed.

Personally, I can't understand any American who can strongly advocate for total freedom to purchase guns after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A total of 26 people were killed by a mentally unstable 20 year-old, Adam Lanza, and 20 of them were young children. That should never happen in a country that claims to be civilized. Never!
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/sandy-hook-shooting.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/sandy-hook-shooting-300x184.jpg" alt="sandy-hook-shooting" width="300" height="184" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1506" /></a>

And yes, it's just as horrible when we consider what happened in that movie theater in Colorado. How many of us have thought about that every time we walked into a movie theater? How do we not all want to stop this gun violence? 
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/120720120113-co-shooting-06-story-top.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/120720120113-co-shooting-06-story-top-300x168.jpg" alt="120720120113-co-shooting-06-story-top" width="300" height="168" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1501" /></a>

Well, according to President Obama, most Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents do want to stop it. However, Republicans in Congress have stood up against it because, "they want to be re-elected into office," said President Obama. He said we can stop that to with our vote. So if we want to stop the gun violence, vote them out was his message.


Then, the President went on to announce a new program that would be done under executive order to make America safer. The President passionately called for stricter background checks for purchasing guns; he called for cutting through loopholes at gun shows; he wants to stop gun purchases on the Internet; he wants to stop domestic violence in homes through the use of guns; he is investing into mental illness to address one of the biggest issues attached to these mass murders - mentally unstable people having access to guns.

Whether you like or dislike President Obama, please watch the full speech before forming your opinion. Please don't react to Twitter feeds or Facebook posts that only provide one side and a narrow opinion. Do yourself a favor and watch the full speech. It was a great moment in American history to be sure, certainly one I will never forget.

I can tell you that President Obama is not trying to take guns away from good citizens, but keeping them away from criminals and dangerous people in our country.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/article-2323957-19C336EE000005DC-446_306x423.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2016/01/article-2323957-19C336EE000005DC-446_306x423-217x300.jpg" alt="article-2323957-19C336EE000005DC-446_306x423" width="217" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1502" /></a>
And the moment from the speech that all of America, and the world, will be talking about is when he talked about how mad he got every time he thought of Sandy Hook and all of those first graders killed. The tears started pouring out of his eyes uncontrollably. That will be in every newspaper and magazine around the world with both positive and negative comments attached, based on the publications editorial view. 

Personally, I'm very proud of President Obama and his efforts to make America safer. I know there are good citizens who believe they need their guns and under the second amendment, they have that right. My hope is that those gun owners will step forward and voice strong support for this safety program, because it protects them as responsible gun owners along with those of us who don't own guns.

It's the bad guys and mentally unstable we are trying to protect against here.

That means that the top 20 percent own 90 percent of the wealth in America. According to PolitiFact, the 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.  This is not a new trend, government data from 1979 to 2007 shows that the income of the richest one percent of Americans grew by 275 percent while the poorest 20 percent in the U.S. grew by only 18 percent. 
 
Here’s the facts on why from the Social Security Administration, which reveals that 38 percent of all American workers made less than $20,000 last year, 51 percent made less than $30,000, 62 percent made less than $40,000, and 71 percent made less than $50,000.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/UnemploymentLineMichiganSnow.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/UnemploymentLineMichiganSnow-300x192.jpg" alt="Unemployment Line" width="300" height="192" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1490" /></a>
Now consider, these are the Americans who are working. The SSA reports there are 7.9 million working-age Americans who are officially unemployed. But worse, there are another 94.7 million working-age Americans considered not in the labor force.  Added together, that is 102.6 million working age Americans who are not working. 

So is it any wonder that people are angry?

Now let’s add to that the underlying distrust factor of mainstream America for the wealthy. We don’t trust the six big banks who hold the majority of the assets, 9.8 trillion, and won’t lend it out to the little guy or small businesses or mortgages for entrepreneurs. No, they have bet that money, 278 trillion in derivatives to be exact, on investments they consider beneficial for themselves. So the government bailed this group out through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Since then, the six big banks have grown even wealthier, won’t lend money to the little guy, and are placing themselves in a position where they can fail and sink the economy even worse than last time.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/six-big-u-s-banks-need-to-raise-an-additional-120-billion.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/six-big-u-s-banks-need-to-raise-an-additional-120-billion-300x167.jpg" alt="six-big-u-s-banks-need-to-raise-an-additional-120-billion" width="300" height="167" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1491" /></a>

Add to that the number of the top one percent of wealthy individuals who are hiding their money in overseas accounts so they don’t have to pay taxes.  The poorest Americans have to pay taxes, while many of the richest escape.

So with a very important U.S. Presidential election coming up, offering the majority of Americans an opportunity  to vote their disapproval of all of this, what are many of them saying they will do according to the polls? In the Republican primary race, in a consensus of polls, 37.5 percent of those polled said they would vote for a billionaire businessman in the top one percent of wealth, who has been factually proven to be a consistent liar. Yes, Donald Trump.  
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners-300x225.jpg" alt="nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1477" /></a>

The Donald’s daily fibs have earned him more four-Pinocchio ratings (highest fib rating) for his "whoppers" by the The Washington Post Fact Checker team than any other candidate. 

So if you consider yourself a fairly bright American and are fed up with the top one percent keeping and growing their wealth while you suffer economically, then the election is the place to direct your anger and vote.  

If you have watched all of the debates and read the news accounts to educate yourself about the candidates, you should be aware that on the GOP side, the most logical, rationale and smartest candidates to choose from include: Rick Santorum, John Kasich and George Pataki. Personally, I hope I have the opportunity to vote for one of them, however not one of them is doing well in the polls, which is astounding to say the least. But each would be better than Trump; significantly better than Trump!
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/rick-santorum_0.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/rick-santorum_0-300x168.jpg" alt="rick-santorum_0" width="300" height="168" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1478" /></a>

On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is hands down the most honest man of integrity this country has had run for President in a long time. The question for voters is his economic policies. He wants to spread the wealth under socialism, trying to make that wealthy one percent pay for his programs. Do you believe that can work? I don't think he can make it work, because the wealthy will find ways to keep their money away from the government.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/bernie-sanders.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/bernie-sanders-300x300.jpg" alt="bernie sanders" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1473" /></a> Then there is Martin O’Malley. He is barely a blip on the polls, but if you have listened to him debate, you know he is smart, had good success as Mayor of Baltimore and then Governor of Maryland and would be a good bet for President. 

Hillary Clinton?  She has proven to have highly questionable integrity, is being supported by the six big banks, would place second behind Trump in fibs, is an ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood, and is playing the women’s card to the hilt in order to try and weasel her way into office. Unfortunately for Hillary, millions of Americans – especially young Americans, millennials, aren’t buying her spin on anything and everything.  Right now, it looks like Bernie Sanders has a good chance of beating her.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/Hillary25.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/Hillary25-273x300.jpg" alt="Hillary25" width="273" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1474" /></a>

As we head toward the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, you can expect the craziness that has occurred to ramp up even more. None of the candidates is perfect. None have been completely truthful. Personally, I’m going to stay focused on the facts, reality and legitimate leaders. And that eliminates the poll-leading candidate from each party, each of whom is wealthy and a proven liar.

That means that the top 20 percent own 90 percent of the wealth in America. According to PolitiFact, the 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.  This is not a new trend, government data from 1979 to 2007 shows that the income of the richest one percent of Americans grew by 275 percent while the poorest 20 percent in the U.S. grew by only 18 percent. 
 
Here’s the facts on why from the Social Security Administration, which reveals that 38 percent of all American workers made less than $20,000 last year, 51 percent made less than $30,000, 62 percent made less than $40,000, and 71 percent made less than $50,000.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/UnemploymentLineMichiganSnow.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/UnemploymentLineMichiganSnow-300x192.jpg" alt="Unemployment Line" width="300" height="192" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1490" /></a>
Now consider, these are the Americans who are working. The SSA reports there are 7.9 million working-age Americans who are officially unemployed. But worse, there are another 94.7 million working-age Americans considered not in the labor force.  Added together, that is 102.6 million working age Americans who are not working. 

So is it any wonder that people are angry?

Now let’s add to that the underlying distrust factor of mainstream America for the wealthy. We don’t trust the six big banks who hold the majority of the assets, 9.8 trillion, and won’t lend it out to the little guy or small businesses or mortgages for entrepreneurs. No, they have bet that money, 278 trillion in derivatives to be exact, on investments they consider beneficial for themselves. So the government bailed this group out through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Since then, the six big banks have grown even wealthier, won’t lend money to the little guy, and are placing themselves in a position where they can fail and sink the economy even worse than last time.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/six-big-u-s-banks-need-to-raise-an-additional-120-billion.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/six-big-u-s-banks-need-to-raise-an-additional-120-billion-300x167.jpg" alt="six-big-u-s-banks-need-to-raise-an-additional-120-billion" width="300" height="167" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1491" /></a>

Add to that the number of the top one percent of wealthy individuals who are hiding their money in overseas accounts so they don’t have to pay taxes.  The poorest Americans have to pay taxes, while many of the richest escape.

So with a very important U.S. Presidential election coming up, offering the majority of Americans an opportunity  to vote their disapproval of all of this, what are many of them saying they will do according to the polls? In the Republican primary race, in a consensus of polls, 37.5 percent of those polled said they would vote for a billionaire businessman in the top one percent of wealth, who has been factually proven to be a consistent liar. Yes, Donald Trump.  
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners-300x225.jpg" alt="nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1477" /></a>

The Donald’s daily fibs have earned him more four-Pinocchio ratings (highest fib rating) for his "whoppers" by the The Washington Post Fact Checker team than any other candidate. 

So if you consider yourself a fairly bright American and are fed up with the top one percent keeping and growing their wealth while you suffer economically, then the election is the place to direct your anger and vote.  

If you have watched all of the debates and read the news accounts to educate yourself about the candidates, you should be aware that on the GOP side, the most logical, rationale and smartest candidates to choose from include: Rick Santorum, John Kasich and George Pataki. Personally, I hope I have the opportunity to vote for one of them, however not one of them is doing well in the polls, which is astounding to say the least. But each would be better than Trump; significantly better than Trump!

On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders is hands down the most honest man of integrity this country has had run for President in a long time. The question for voters is his economic policies. He wants to spread the wealth under socialism, trying to make that wealthy one percent pay for his programs. Do you believe that can work? I don't think he can make it work, because the wealthy will find ways to keep their money away from the government.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/bernie-sanders.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/bernie-sanders-300x300.jpg" alt="bernie sanders" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1473" /></a> Then there is Martin O’Malley. He is barely a blip on the polls, but if you have listened to him debate, you know he is smart, had good success as Mayor of Baltimore and then Governor of Maryland and would be a good bet for President. 

Hillary Clinton?  She has proven to have highly questionable integrity, is being supported by the six big banks, would place second behind Trump in fibs, is an ardent supporter of Planned Parenthood, and is playing the women’s card to the hilt in order to try and weasel her way into office. Unfortunately for Hillary, millions of Americans – especially young Americans, millennials, aren’t buying her spin on anything and everything.  Right now, it looks like Bernie Sanders has a good chance of beating her.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/Hillary25.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/Hillary25-273x300.jpg" alt="Hillary25" width="273" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1474" /></a>

As we head toward the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, you can expect the craziness that has occurred to ramp up even more. None of the candidates is perfect. None have been completely truthful. Personally, I’m going to stay focused on the facts, reality and legitimate leaders. And that eliminates the poll-leading candidate from each party, each of whom is wealthy and a proven liar.

It’s a quality movie with potential Academy Awards in its future, presenting the investigative reporting by the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe exposing an evil that was taking place in the Boston Archdiocese dating back several decades. I hope all Catholics throughout the United States will see this movie, which is the quickest way to become partially educated about the start of the scandal revelation in the United States.

I am a practicing Catholic and have read the great religion reporter Jason Berry’s books, so I was well aware of the details behind the scandal. This movie focuses on a team of dedicated Boston Globe reporters working against the grain of a Catholic-dominated society, many of whom preferred to look the other way and practice their faith in denial of the evil that was taking place in many of the parishes throughout Boston. I will never understand that mentality and that choice since Jesus stood for truth. Christianity is truth, not a cover-up of evil acts, whether it be pedophiles taking advantage of the priesthood or misdeeds in the Roman Curia or Vatican Bank. Thank goodness we now have Pope Francis leading the Church and working hard to clean up those problems.

I am also a journalist and <em>All the President’s Men</em> is a movie that inspired me toward the newspaper business following college. Like that famous 1976 movie about the Washington Post’s great investigative reporting duo, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, <em>Spotlight</em> presents the story of the investigative team at the Boston Globe pursuing the pedophile priest scandal taking place throughout the Archdiocese of Boston. This was all being directed by the very powerful Cardinal Bernard Law with the transfer of criminal priests from one parish to the next, destroying the lives of more than a thousand young boys and their families. 
[caption id="attachment_1444" align="alignright" width="222"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/jason-berry-pic.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/jason-berry-pic.jpg" alt="Journalist Jason Berry" width="222" height="224" class="size-full wp-image-1444" /></a> Journalist Jason Berry[/caption]

When this movie came out, Jason Berry wrote that he had known Father Law when the young priest was a civil rights activist in Mississippi and editor of the Mississippi Register, where he received death threats for his strong positions on civil rights. At that time, Berry found Law to be a very intelligent and conscientious young priest who stood up for the civil rights of African Americans. Law seemed to be a man of integrity, but somewhere along the line, the conscientious objector’s conscience stopped objecting.  In Berry’s PBS Frontline documentary, he addressed “institutionalism” as one of the key reasons many priests, bishops and cardinals went along with this sick and twisted system of crime against youth.  In other words, they were “company men” going along with the organization as opposed to the much larger and more important responsibility of representing Christ. 

In his book, <em>Render Unto Rome</em>, Berry wrote about an important 1989 decision that led to the continuance of abuse and ultimately the revelation and scale of the scandal. From <em>Render Unto Rome</em>:

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/render-unto-rome.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/render-unto-rome-196x300.jpg" alt="render unto rome" width="196" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1445" /></a>“The American bishops had been stymied in their early efforts to confront the crisis. In 1989 the U.S. bishops had canonists seek permission from the Vatican to defrock priests proven to be severe abusers. That authority lay with the pope. And John Paul said no.” (Page 79)
“In April 2000 bishops from the English-speaking world met with Vatican officials, pleading for help. In 2001 John Paul signed a document that (Cardinal Joseph) Ratzinger all but drafted, which consolidated the responsibility on the explosive issue in his office.” (Page 80) 

Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict, was in charge of managing this issue as the prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith (CDF). Up until 2001, most of the investigations conducted by that office involved theologians who had strayed from the orthodoxy. But from 2001-2010, the CDF dealt with more than 3,000 cases of priests accused of abusing children.

The movie doesn’t cover that aspect of the scandal but for the sake of the story, focuses on Boston, because it was an investigation that became very personal for many of the reporters on the Spotlight staff.  All had grown up in Boston and were raised Catholics. Many were lapsed or now practicing a different faith.  The Spotlight editor Walter “Robby” Robinson, played by Michael Keaton, had attended Boston College High School and had to confront former schoolmates and friends who were either in denial over the illicit activities taking place, or just preferred to turn a blind eye to all of it. Even when they found out one of their classmates had been abused, some were willing to dismiss it. It was also very personal for Spotlight reporter Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, who went to mass each week with her Nana, a devout Catholic. When the scandal stories were published, the movie showed her Nana crying. I’m sure that reflected what thousands of Catholics in Boston experienced during those sad days.

[caption id="attachment_1437" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/Michael-Keaton.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/Michael-Keaton-300x160.jpg" alt="Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams" width="300" height="160" class="size-medium wp-image-1437" /></a> Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams[/caption]

The personal side of this story is the side that many Catholics can relate, because there is nothing more personal than an individual’s religion. So what would any Catholic have done if placed in the same circumstance? To me, that’s the question each should walk out of the theater considering. Who would do the right thing? Who would turn a blind eye and go along with the program? 

Research has shown the majority of the priests are very good and dedicated men who help the Catholics in their pews understand and practice their faith. Even with one good priest though, Catholics should walk into their church with eyes open. It’s very difficult to identify a pedophile who has infiltrated the now accountable system. From reading about the scandal, along with other news stories about what takes place in schools and youth organizations, it’s obvious that pedophiles target opportunities where they are placed in a position of authority and have access to boys.  Therefore, at some point the Catholic Church became a breeding ground for these gay pedophiles. The movie makes it clear that these evil men sought out boys who were from poor families and had just suffered the loss of a father. They were taking advantage of an authoritative position with these boys who were hurting emotionally. They also sought out gay boys who were hurting and vulnerable.

As Pope Francis has stated many times, don’t dismiss the evil of the devil. It’s everywhere. Thankfully, the reporting team at the Globe had the courage to identify the evil in Boston and follow through on the investigation, printing the stories that ignited other investigations throughout America and the world. During the time of the scandal, the movie quotes a researcher who states that at that time, six percent of priests in an Archdiocese were pedophiles.  That proved true in Boston. Now, with the efforts by the Catholic Church to be transparent, certainly since Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope in March of 2013, the hope is that percentage is far less as he works to clean house. 

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/catholic-praying.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/catholic-praying.jpg" alt="catholic praying" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1446" /></a>

Despite the scandal and all of the negative media produced to cover it, it’s always important to remember that being Catholic is about practicing the faith. If and when the organization fails, which it has done many times over its 2000-year history, it only means that some of the shepherds responsible for leading the Church have not lived up to their responsibility to God. But the Catholic faith is - and always will be - as pure as it was when Jesus first gave us the <em>good news</em>. If a situation arises at a parish where a Catholic is no longer comfortable practicing the only faith given to us by Jesus Christ, then find another parish where there is a comfort and confidence level. I have been to parishes all over the country and I know for certain there are far more good priests now than at any other time in my lifetime. I’m always amazed to walk into a new Catholic church and be completely inspired by the educated and passionate words of a dedicated priest.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/jesus.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/jesus.jpg" alt="jesus" width="194" height="260" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1447" /></a>

So when it comes to joining a parish, Catholics need to do their research and be selective. The church selected shouldn’t be the closest one to home, but the parish with a priest who each parishioner can decide if they like and respect.
   
The scandal was a very difficult and challenging time for Catholics. But we should never give up on our faith. Keep the faith and pray for the Catholic Church.

It was also very personal for Spotlight reporter Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, who went to mass each week with her Nana, a devout Catholic. When the scandal stories were published, the movie showed her Nana crying. I’m sure that reflected what thousands of Catholics in Boston experienced during those sad days.

The personal side of this story is the side that many Catholics can relate, because there is nothing more personal than an individual’s religion. So what would any Catholic have done if placed in the same circumstance? To me, that’s the question each should walk out of the theater considering. Who would do the right thing? Who would turn a blind eye and go along with the program? 

Research has shown the majority of the priests are very good and dedicated men who help the Catholics in their pews understand and practice their faith. Even with one good priest though, Catholics should walk into their church with eyes open. It’s very difficult to identify a pedophile who has infiltrated the now accountable system. From reading about the scandal, along with other news stories about what takes place in schools and youth organizations, it’s obvious that pedophiles target opportunities where they are placed in a position of authority and have access to boys.  Therefore, at some point the Catholic Church became a breeding ground for these gay pedophiles. The movie makes it clear that these evil men sought out boys who were from poor families and had just suffered the loss of a father. They were taking advantage of an authoritative position with these boys who were hurting emotionally. They also sought out gay boys who were hurting and vulnerable.

As Pope Francis has stated many times, don’t dismiss the evil of the devil. It’s everywhere. Thankfully, the reporting team at the Globe had the courage to identify the evil in Boston and follow through on the investigation, printing the stories that ignited other investigations throughout America and the world. During the time of the scandal, the movie quotes a researcher who states that at that time, six percent of priests in an Archdiocese were pedophiles.  That proved true in Boston. Now, with the efforts by the Catholic Church to be transparent, certainly since Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope in March of 2013, the hope is that percentage is far less as he works to clean house. 

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/catholic-praying.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/catholic-praying.jpg" alt="catholic praying" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1446" /></a>

Despite the scandal and all of the negative media produced to cover it, it’s always important to remember that being Catholic is about practicing the faith. If and when the organization fails, which it has done many times over its 2000-year history, it only means that some of the shepherds responsible for leading the Church have not lived up to their responsibility to God. But the Catholic faith is - and always will be - as pure as it was when Jesus first gave us the <em>good news</em>. If a situation arises at a parish where a Catholic is no longer comfortable practicing the only faith given to us by Jesus Christ, then find another parish where there is a comfort and confidence level. I have been to parishes all over the country and I know for certain there are far more good priests now than at any other time in my lifetime. I’m always amazed to walk into a new Catholic church and be completely inspired by the educated and passionate words of a dedicated priest.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/jesus.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/12/jesus.jpg" alt="jesus" width="194" height="260" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1447" /></a>

So when it comes to joining a parish, Catholics need to do their research and be selective. The church selected shouldn’t be the closest one to home, but the parish with a priest who each parishioner can decide if they like and respect.
   
The scandal was a very difficult and challenging time for Catholics. But we should never give up on our faith. Keep the faith and pray for the Catholic Church.

So what are they warning us about?  WHO? The researchers. According to their review, processed meat, which means it has been cured, salted or smoked, is carcinogenic. That means it has the potential to cause cancer. Those meats include bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces.  Red meat, which they term as “probably carcinogenic” includes beef, lamb and pork. 


Says WHO? That’s right.

What? Second base.

Is this ground-breaking news? I don’t know. Third base. Yes, doctors have known for years about the dietary risk-factors associated with meat. I guess they just felt like they needed to remind us of this right before the holidays. WHO? That’s right.

I read another story in the Tribune where the report stated 50 grams of bacon increases the risk of cancer by 18 percent. What? Second base. But the reporter made it clear that you would have to eat 50 grams of bacon each day to increase that risk.  And let’s not forget, other researchers have revealed that meat provides valuable nutrients. Says WHO? No, some other guys. 

Bacon is absolutely a favorite of millions of Americans. WHO? Again, not them.
 
Personally, I eat bacon about once a month, so I’m not going to change that habit. 

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/11/bacon.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/11/bacon.jpg" alt="bacon" width="253" height="199" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1423" /></a>

So in light of the timing of this news, before the holidays, I wonder how many Americans will change their holiday eating habits. I don’t know. Third base. 

Me? Nope, I’m not changing a thing. Last year, I found out about the Holiday Gift Check Program and ordered gift checks for my clients so they could go out and buy a turkey for the holidays. I got great feedback from each of them, which I appreciated. This year, I got a notice that the program is adding ham, so if clients want to purchase a ham instead of a turkey, they can do so. Like bacon, if you eat turkey or ham on the holidays as a treat, that’s not going to cause cancer. If you ate it every day, then yes, you would be taking a risk. Says WHO? That’s right. 

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/11/Ham.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/11/Ham-300x251.jpg" alt="108006 P.140-141+" width="300" height="251" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1421" /></a>

But I say, eat processed meat on occasion and red meat in moderation and you won’t have a problem. Says WHO? No, says me.  Now I’ve got to go order my checks so my clients can partake in turkey and/or ham over the holidays. If you are interested in doing the same, or giving them to employees or friends, you can go to www.giftcheckprogram.com.

Happy Holidays to the meat-eaters of America! WHO? No, everyone else.

If you look at how movies, television shows, magazines, news shows, talk shows and too many books present that scenario, often times the wrong choice is played up as the fun and exciting choice. "Oh, he’ll never find out," she says. "Oh she’ll never know," he says. Perhaps in many cases that is true, but the cheater will know. Of course that's the choice if there is no acceptance of right or wrong, no moral compass, no voice inside their head and heart saying, “You just made a big mistake! Don’t do it again.”

Justification usually plays a part in it. "She's so beautiful, I can't help myself!" says the cheating husband. "He's so handsome, I can't say no," says the cheating wife. When you start justifying actions you clearly know are wrong, that should be the first clue. Of course, easier said than done and for many, it feels like an addiction they can't avoid. As an old boss once told me, "People can justify anything, and do."

Well, that genius pulled his wonderful wife out of the Midwest hometown she loved, put her in a small New York high-rise apartment, alone, while he spent most of the day at a major PR firm where he met and had an affair with a lady 30 years younger than him. When he got the young lady pregnant, his wife divorced him and he moved to London, where his ex-wife and three kids want nothing to do with him any longer. The choices he made, have him living a very lonely, guilt-filled life. He had it all, and now at 70, he will spend his final days alone. That's the risk he took and tried to justify to himself 20 years ago.

I’m Catholic and for me, the choices my old boss made are unimaginable. I'll never understand it or the justifications placed behind it. Like many Christians – certainly not all - I have that moral compass embedded in my heart. Everyone has the thoughts, but it’s about turning away from the actions. Men are experts at not sharing their problems. So most go it alone, trying to figure it out on their own. Of course, the suicide rate for men over 45 is very high and this is one of the reasons.

In my public relations business, I’ve worked on various communications projects in the past and one of them was connected to mental health and strongly promoted, “Talk Therapy” as a way to help stay mentally healthy. For women, this is an easy choice, which is one of the reasons they live longer than men. Trying to get most men to talk to their buddy about a very personal experience is like asking them to climb Pikes Peak. I take that back. So many men would rather climb Pikes Peak than spill their soul to help their mental health. And, trying to get them to go see a psychiatrist? I wrote about that issue through NFL Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell’s experience, but he can be listed as one of the smart ones, and alive to tell his story.

For Catholics, confession provides the opportunity to cleanse the soul. That’s one thing about confession I think should never be dismissed. Even if you are kneeling behind that screen and the priest can’t see you, it takes courage to confess your sins, especially the bad ones. That’s why you will most often hear Catholics say, “I went to confession today and feel so much better.” 

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/11/divine-mercy-confession.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/11/divine-mercy-confession-300x201.jpg" alt="divine-mercy-confession" width="300" height="201" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1405" /></a> 

Men, if you are making some bad choices in life and you have a moral compass, you can hear that little voice telling you that you are making a mistake. You feel it. Listen to that voice and those feelings. Please do yourself a favor and don't hold it inside. Find a friend you can trust to talk about it. Or start by going to confession. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better you will feel afterwards. And in the process, you may save your own life, and feel good about yourself again.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"John Ruane";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5298:"In a world where there seems to be fewer and fewer boundaries or guidance away from infidelity in marriages, the truth of that choice should be shouted louder than the short-lived fun and excitement that draws so many into breaking that verbal contract at the altar upon stating “I do.”

Well, that genius pulled his wonderful wife out of the Midwest hometown she loved, put her in a small New York high-rise apartment, alone, while he spent most of the day at a major PR firm where he met and had an affair with a lady 30 years younger than him. When he got the young lady pregnant, his wife divorced him and he moved to London, where his ex-wife and three kids want nothing to do with him any longer. The choices he made, have him living a very lonely, guilt-filled life. He had it all, and now at 70, he will spend his final days alone. That's the risk he took and tried to justify to himself 20 years ago.

I’m Catholic and for me, the choices my old boss made are unimaginable. I'll never understand it or the justifications placed behind it. Like many Christians – certainly not all - I have that moral compass embedded in my heart. Everyone has the thoughts, but it’s about turning away from the actions. Men are experts at not sharing their problems. So most go it alone, trying to figure it out on their own. Of course, the suicide rate for men over 45 is very high and this is one of the reasons.

In my public relations business, I’ve worked on various communications projects in the past and one of them was connected to mental health and strongly promoted, “Talk Therapy” as a way to help stay mentally healthy. For women, this is an easy choice, which is one of the reasons they live longer than men. Trying to get most men to talk to their buddy about a very personal experience is like asking them to climb Pikes Peak. I take that back. So many men would rather climb Pikes Peak than spill their soul to help their mental health. And, trying to get them to go see a psychiatrist? I wrote about that issue through NFL Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell’s experience, but he can be listed as one of the smart ones, and alive to tell his story.

For Catholics, confession provides the opportunity to cleanse the soul. That’s one thing about confession I think should never be dismissed. Even if you are kneeling behind that screen and the priest can’t see you, it takes courage to confess your sins, especially the bad ones. That’s why you will most often hear Catholics say, “I went to confession today and feel so much better.”

Men, if you are making some bad choices in life and you have a moral compass, you can hear that little voice telling you that you are making a mistake. You feel it. Listen to that voice and those feelings. Please do yourself a favor and don't hold it inside. Find a friend you can trust to talk about it. Or start by going to confession. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better you will feel afterwards. And in the process, you may save your own life, and feel good about yourself again.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

Conan has done very well as a talk show host with millions of fans, but in my view, NBC made the wrong choice.

Now, CBS has shown great wisdom in selecting Mr. Colbert to replace the great David Letterman as host of <em>The Late Show</em>. The book was updated last year due to all the changes in the industry, which is reflected in this chapter. The names of celebrities and shows have been altered slightly just to underscore this is satire, however most of it is true with background facts. Here is the chapter. Hope you enjoy it. 

<ul><strong>A TALE OF TWO TALK SHOWS</strong></ul>
It was late on a Friday evening in January of 2010 when two good friends from the popular cable channel ComedyCenter entered their new favorite Italian bistro after finishing the taping of their final show of the week.

Stephen Clobear and Soupy Stewart, two incredibly funny, talented and smart political comedy stars had started a tradition of going out after the final show of the week. Stewart, whose real name is Leftonritz, but had it legally changed because he was tired of all the cracker jokes, can be described as a survivor -- a great entertainment success story.

He grew up in New Jersey and first tried Standup comedy in 1986 under the name Shecky Tuna, bombed, got the nerve to try it again under the name Soupy Stewart and within a few years was soon receiving opportunities to perform on ComedyCenter and Fun TV. In 1993, he was one of the frontrunners for the host of the popular late night talk show, Good Night, after Daniel Littleton bolted to do The Big Show on another network. Instead of Stewart, the executive producer at Good Night selected a writer and producer for Saturday Evening Theater, Conan O’Ryan, to host the national talk show.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/john-stewart.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/john-stewart-239x300.jpg" alt="Jon Stewart Portrait Session" width="239" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1375" /></a>

But the 5’10”, good-looking, energetic and determined neighborhood tiddlywinks champion from New Jersey forged on, and after a few other failed TV gigs, was given the chance to take over the Craig Show on ComedyCenter when that legendary comedy giant, Craig Kiljoy, left for a late night network show.

ComedyCenter renamed the show The Soupy Stewart Show and the comedian soon learned that sometimes it takes more than just a break to achieve success. Sometimes it takes the right break. Stewart was a hit and went on to become one of the most popular television personalities in America, winning Emmy, Peabody, and Grammy awards, not to mention the opportunity to host two Academy Awards shows, perhaps the highest honor given to anyone in his business.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/838-495_StephenColbert.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/838-495_StephenColbert-251x300.jpg" alt="838-495_StephenColbert" width="251" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1368" /></a>

His buddy, Stephen Clobear, has somewhat of a similar story, searching for the right break. He grew up in South Carolina, but went to Northwestern University to study theater and ended up at the famed Compass City Theater where he developed his talent. Later, he took off for New York with a couple of other Compass City comedy actors, where they tried their sketch comedy here and there, and struggled. But in the mid-1990s, Clobear started catching a few breaks, hired as a writer for Saturday Evening Theater, often referred to as SET, then the short-lived Dana Harvey Show and finally The Soupy Stewart Show.

Working with Soupy, Clobear developed his on-air right wing republican character, a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly, and his star rose quickly. He became so popular, ComedyCenter spun off his character into a new show he would host called, The Clobear Report, which has become a highly successful, and often quoted show on real national news shows.

On this Friday evening, the two tired national comedy stars made their way to Guido’s Place, a restaurant Stewart happened into about a month earlier after he had taken a wrong turn into a not so nice section of Hell’s Kitchen off 8th Avenue. That evening, the owner, one Guido Manilucci, offered him dinner on the house and asked for a photo he could hang up in the center of the Wall of Fame, the most prominent place.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/mediumhellskitchenvincent-des-jardins.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/mediumhellskitchenvincent-des-jardins-300x200.jpg" alt="mediumhellskitchen(vincent des jardins)" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1374" /></a>

This pleasant and affordable experience led Stewart to start frequenting the dining establishment, despite the neighborhood, decorum, food and so on. Free food and his photo on the wall, why not? A few weeks later, he decided to make it the Friday dinner spot for him and his pal from South Carolina.

Guido, a lifelong New Yorker, spotted the two cable talk show giants entering the front door and quickly walked up to greet them.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/87514673df7b4ebc.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/87514673df7b4ebc-300x199.jpg" alt="-87514673df7b4ebc" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1370" /></a>

“Stephen and Soupy, hey how’s it going, eh?” said the middle-aged, overweight, mustached and jovial owner with a heavy New York accent. “Ya know I got your favorite table open.”

“Hey thanks Guido,” said Stewart, smiling, but looking tired from a tough week of being funny and smart, not easy in any business, but really difficult when a million people are watching you attempt it each night. “I am starved!”

“Me too!” said Clobear, following Stewart and Guido to the back of the restaurant and a small table with two rickety old chairs in a corner with red brick walls on each side, decorated only by a few lit candles, some of which were duct taped to stay in place. “Why don’t you have the chef start cookin’ up our favorites?”

“Yes,” added Stewart. “And I know Stephen and I would like a glass of your finest grape, as always, Guido my good man.”

“Hey dat sounds good Soupy,” said Guido, shrugging his shoulders, and then tilting his head from side to side, the nervous mannerisms he exhibits every time he addresses someone. “I will get on it right away. Youz twos guys go ahead and sit down, I’ll have dat bottle of chardonnay out here before you can tuck your napkin in, you know? Hey you know what I mean? Before you can tuck your napkin in. Know what I’m saying?”

“We got you gumba,” laughed Stewart whose fairly large nicely framed photo hung on the wall opposite his table. Guido was always eager to let guests know this was Soupy Stewart’s favorite hangout and THE table where he ate his meals. He never saw Soupy’s show, not once, but a young bartender, Billy O’Donnell, filled him in the show and its famous host.

“Soupy when are they going to put my photo up there?” asked Clobear, looking at the Wall of Fame where Stewart’s photo took the most prominent position at the center, surrounded by several other photos of local news celebrities in town. On the right of his signed ComedyCenter mugshot was a framed Polaroid photo of Mike Smithson, an associate producer for the 5 a.m. news at WMBC-TV. To the left was a coffee-stained photo of Mary O’Neil, the receptionist at WOOR-TV. And right below was a police lineup profile photo of the always recognized, Marty Forkin, the security guard at FLUX News for about five weeks in the late 1990s. Yes, this was a group Stewart was proud to be among, no question about it.

Clobear struggled with the thinking behind the pecking order at the restaurant.

“I gave them a signed photo a few weeks ago,” said The Clobear Report’s star, not accustomed to being snubbed by anyone, especially the owner of a rat-infested restaurant.

“The photo is up Stephen,” informed his pal. “I saw it. A beautiful spot, right over the urinal.”

“Hah, hah, you are a funny man Soupy,” chuckled Clobear, organizing the salt and pepper shakers on the table so they were lined up correctly with the napkin holder.

“I’m not kidding,” he said with a straight face. “They have no idea who you are.”

“What?”

“They had no idea who I was either until they hired a college kid to tend bar, who told them about me and the show. Unfortunately, Billy O’Donnell only lasted two days, because he couldn’t converse with Guido and his staff about network TV shows like COPS, Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune. He never watched them. Too bad you weren’t with me the first day I came here. Your picture would be right up there with mine for all of the half-wits, nitwits and dimwits that come in this place to admire. Isn’t that what it’s all about?”

Clobear rolled his eyes, adjusted his glasses and took a sip of the water when he couldn’t help but notice the waiter serving the food at a table in front of them. “Oh my God, it’s him!”

Stewart looked over to see a dark-haired, overweight, 40-something waiter with a sagging and red-splotched apron around his waist serving the plates of pasta to an odd looking couple a few tables away -- an old businessman with a young woman that didn’t seem to be his daughter.

“Do you think they know?” asked Stewart.

“No way,” said Clobear, watching the waiter walk away from the couple’s table, back toward the kitchen area. He stopped at a station that had stacked 8-ounce glasses and large plastic pitchers of water. “Here it comes.”

“Wouldn’t’ be any fun coming here, if he didn’t” said Stewart, who watched the waiter take a pitcher, pour a glass of water, then stand up straight drinking the glass of water in his left hand, while he used his right hand to violently adjust his personal equipment, then readjust it, then went deep sea diving into his pants to make sure his moray eel was properly cared for.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/20071204-037.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/20071204-037-300x238.jpg" alt="20071204-037" width="300" height="238" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1369" /></a>

Stewart and Clobear couldn’t help laughing at this incredibly disgusting ritual which they had watched many times, but never had the heart to tell any of the other customers prior to being served.

“Oh that’s new!” said Clobear, seeing the waiter do a two-thumbed scratch of the lower groin, finishing with a satisfied and audible, “Ahhh!”

“He should, write a book about best ways to scratch and adjust, don’t you think Stephen?” asked Stewart. “I’d book ‘em.”

Guido returned to the table and showed the two political comedy news stars a bottle of chardonnay. “Hey, dis is some of our best stuff right here guys. Youz guys are gonna luv dis!”

Clobear looked at the label as Guido turned the twist cap off of the wine bottle, “Ah yes,” he said. “2008 was a very good year! Last year, wasn’t it?”

“I’m tellin’ ya, you will luv dis!” said Guido. “Troot is, I donno ‘xactly where it comes from, but I know our guys get it off da back of a truck in da Bronx.”

“May I sniff the twistoff cap?” asked Stewart, sharing his sarcastic humor with his comedy pal, knowing it would sail right over Guido’s balding head. Clobear just put his head down and laughed, but stopped abruptly as a disturbing thought occurred to him.

“Hey Guido, I know you are aware of this, but just so there are no mixups,” said the ultra neat and clean Clobear with a look of concern on his face. “We always like you to serve our food, right? I mean you know that, don’t you?”

“I take great pride in serving youz two guys,” said Guido.

“We appreciate that,” Stewart smiled. “We just wouldn’t want that other waiter over there serving us, if it’s okay with you?”

Guido looked back over his shoulder to see the waiter Stewart was referring, now talking with a younger waiter at the water station.

“Do you mean Joey over there?” he asked, pointing toward the two men.

“Well I don’t know his name,” said Stewart, then seeing the waiter now demonstrating the two-hand grab and tug adjustment. “There, him! Tommy Tug-a-lot over there.”

Chuckling, Clobear couldn’t help but assist, “Yes, he means Sammy Scrotum Shiner there.”

Stewart wouldn’t be one-upped, “Tug McBall Scratcher.”

“Thumbs McCrank Yanker,” laughed Clobear.

“We’re like a couple of fifth graders, aren’t we Stephen?” Stewart said to his amused pal.

“We are, but we’re funny fifth graders and we get paid millions of dollars,” said the dark-haired king of dry, straight-faced humor. “Who would have thought our little wise-guy antics in grade school would take us so far, eh?”

Guido looked over at his two waiters and figured out to whom they were referring. “Hey Bobby,” he yelled across the room. “Would you mind getting your damn hands outta your pants! This is a restaurant. People eat dat food ya serve.”<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/jon.stewart.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/jon.stewart-300x168.jpg" alt="Jon Stewart Portrait Session" width="300" height="168" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1376" /></a>

The odd looking couple that had just been served stopped mid-chew to look up at the waiter, saw him finishing an intense game of pocket pool, put their forks down, spit the food into their napkins and called for the check.

“Scuse me gents,” said Guido, who went over to the table to talk to his now-sickened customers.

Clobear took a sip of the wine and remarked, “This is good, if you like turpentine.”

“Oh, I love turpentine,” quipped the graying Soupy Stewart Show host, looking around to make sure no-one could hear him, then spoke in a low tone of voice. “Hey Stephen, let me ask you a pretty sensitive question, if you don’t mind?”

Clobear realizing the funny had left the room for a moment and it was time for a serious conversation said, “Sure, what’s up?”

“Well, this must stay between you and me, right?”

Guido turned from the odd couples’ table and said to Stewart, “Don’t you mean to say, you and I? Ya know?”

“Wow that’s the worst case of elephant ears I’ve ever witnessed,” said a concerned looking Stewart, who lowered his head and voice even further.

“Look, no problem Soupy, go ahead,” Clobear responded, confident he would keep any secret for the man who gave him his big break in the entertainment business.

“Well, we are both really funny, right?” Stewart began.

“Right,” agreed Clobear.

“I mean, critics, viewers, everyone seems to think our shows are incredibly funny, right? That’s the same input you get, isn’t it? It’s what we have heard for several years. It’s why I get asked to host the Academy Awards and so on, right?”

“Yes, absolutely,” Clobear agreed once more, now wondering where Soupy was going with this line of questioning.

“Well, wouldn’t you think one of the networks would have made one of us, or both of us, an offer by now to take our shows to a larger audience?” asked a bewildered-looking Stewart. “I mean let’s be honest. Some of the network guys aren’t really that funny and they seem to be getting a real shot at the big-time. I love ComedyCenter and the opportunity they have given us, but it has somewhat of a limited reach, wouldn’t you agree?”

Clobear sat and considered this logic for a moment, then said, “Soupy, honestly, I think our shows are too irreverent, too controversial for the average network viewer. I don’t think you can be as politically disruptive as we are when you are on one of the three major networks. You can’t forget Soupy, our humor and views appeal to a certain audience -- college students, college graduates now in the business world who are sharp, smart people. They read the news, know what’s going on. They get it. A lot of the folks in the rural areas, and even the cities -- as we both witnessed tonight -- don’t get cable or satellite TV and depend on the networks for their programs. Do you really think a lot of those folks would like our humor? Heck no! They would hate us!”

Stewart knew his pal was right, but struggled with the idea that lesser talented comedians were getting those more prominent network slots in front of them. Not to mention the big money!

Clobear continued, “The networks need someone who can appeal to that general audience. Safer humor that will entertain without offending, keeping the ratings.”

“Even if they aren’t that funny?” asked Stewart.

“Like who?” wondered Clobear, who certainly had his own list on the subject.

“Well, I don’t want to name any names, but…” Stewart stopped when he saw the young waiter and Lance McItchy walk past them carrying a very large golden frame toward the Wall of Fame. The two waiters placed the framed photo on the floor, leaning it against the wall, while they took down the four big local celebs, including Stewart, to make room. Then they hung the new photo.

“Hey excuse me, Tug McBall Scratcher, what are you doing?” asked Stewart, who was in no mood to see his photo removed from the wall of the Condessa Del Firetrap.

“Owner said we needs to put dis new one up,” said the walking restaurant code-violation. And there, taking Stewart’s place on the wall, was an all-too-familiar face. A man they both called a friend, Conan O’Ryan.

“Well, that’s nice,” said Stewart with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. “First he gets to host Good Night, then The Night Show and now my spot on a wall in a restaurant that no respectable celebrity would venture into.”

“He is our friend,” reminded Clobear. “We should just be happy for him.”

“Yes, I know,” said Soupy, grimacing as Guido returned to the table. “I’m just ecstatic!”
********************************************************************
At this same moment in Beverly Hills, California, it was nearly 7 p.m. and Conan O’Ryan had just finished taping The Night Show for his final show of the week with guests Rice Weatherspoon and Porche Delray. The beautiful and always engaging Weatherspoon had put O’Ryan into a great mood which was quickly dissipated by Delray, who told an incredibly stupid story that went on and on about taking her dog for a walk, ended up at a friend’s gated home, where she was not invited, but entered the grounds, where her dog got away, and a security camera followed her while she looked at the security pad on the stone fence column and oh my goodness, O’Ryan was ready to hang himself listening to her.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/conan-obrien-1-sized.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/conan-obrien-1-sized-236x300.jpg" alt="conan-obrien-1-sized" width="236" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1373" /></a>

Off to the sanctuary of the posh restaurant at the Beverly Hills Hotel where O’Ryan was scheduled to meet his longtime friend, Robert Smigal, for dinner. The two successful comedy stars were greeted at the door immediately by a beautiful and sophisticated host named Barbara, who was surrounded by an always-professional staff, some of whom just happened to be big Conan O’Ryan fans. One, a very cute blonde waitress, offered to show the famed talk show host and his friend to the best seat in the restaurant looking out at the beautiful garden area, which was lit wonderfully by the setting sun.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/4c5d21e8e8c6d8589cfb0063f12395ab5bc83ec8d324678d92f7318e.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/4c5d21e8e8c6d8589cfb0063f12395ab5bc83ec8d324678d92f7318e-257x300.jpg" alt="4c5d21e8e8c6d8589cfb0063f12395ab5bc83ec8d324678d92f7318e" width="257" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1366" /></a>

“Right this way Mr. O’Ryan,” said the waitress, dressed in short light brown coat, white collared shirt, brown bow tie and matching brown skirt, presenting a very impressive and professional-looking uniform.

“So honored to have you join us,” said a beautiful brunette girl who joined her associate to help seat O’Ryan and his friend, who they didn’t recognize. The brunette waitress was a stunning beauty, who could have been international film star Annaleah Folie’s double – someone who should be starring in movies, not seating talk show hosts at a restaurant.

When they reached the soft light green padded semi-circular booth, the blonde girl lost her composure for just a moment and made an inappropriate request, “Mr. O’Ryan, would you mind?” she began, then looked like she was reconsidering her request. “Can you do the jump for me? Would you mind? I love the jump!”

The always-polite New Englander didn’t blink, got into his low crouch with arms bent back for thrust and sprang forward, launching himself a full six inches, then spun pointing at the young lady. This was the move that has become the Red-Haired Wonder’s signature, like Johnny Carson’s golf swing.

The celebrity frenzy had begun and the brunette was not to be denied. “Can I touch your…?” she asked holding her right hand out toward his famous red locks.”

“Sure why not,” he said, feeling her very lovely hand make it’s way through his thick long red hair. Somehow, this request was all-too familiar and when beauties like this made the request, the great O’Ryan had to remind himself about his lovely wife Judy and two young children, Brady and Josh, back at home.

As he sat down, he began to wonder if Hollywood was becoming a prison for him. Knowing he was leaving The Night Show in only a few weeks, he was now in a position where he had to make a decision about his future. In New York, he could usually walk down the streets without too much harassment outside of, “Hi Conan! How’s it going Conan! Red Sox suck Conan!” Although he was from Boston and a Red Sox fan, New Yorkers considered him one of them, which is a unique allowance for New Yorkers, especially when it comes to the Red Sox. Should he go back east to relaunch his career or stay in L.A?

O’Ryan’s friend, Smigal, was visiting from New Jersey and is rarely recognized on the street. His success evolved from the legendary sketches he wrote for Saturday Evening Theater and later the off-beat TV Funtime cartoon segments on SET that have made his name famous. And if the young wait staff at the restaurant were to learn that Smigal was the creator of Victory the Rude Funny Pup, all hell would break loose and he would be signing autographs for hours.

In an industry where true loyalty is rare, Conan felt a very strong bond to his dark curly-haired, middle-aged friend, who is considered a genius by many in the entertainment industry. Smigal played a significant role in Conan’s success, lobbying producer Loren Michaelson to hire his SET writing buddy for the Good Night host job, knowing Conan would excel in that chair. And when Conan was selected, Smigal joined him at Good Night to help make the show a success with incredibly zany comedy bits, which have become famous throughout America starting with the “lips” segments, which would featured a large celebrity photo with the lips cut out, so Smigal could mouth crazy dialogue in a conversation with Conan.

Many at SET believed that Conan was born to be a talk show host, recognizing O’Ryan’s ability to talk to people, interview them, sincerely listening and staying within the moment of the conversation, following up with good questions pertaining directly to the specific details being shared that moment. His talent wasn’t that of a great comedian. It was his people skills, interview skills, plus knowing how to play his part within a comedy bit.

O’Ryan could never touch the talents of seasoned standup comedians like Jay Leno or David Letterman. Or the great comic talents of Stephen Clobear or Soupy Stewart for that matter. No, the Red-Haired Wonder’s talents become apparent the second he sits in the talk show hosts chair where his genuinely warm personality and likeability become apparent.

So there in the Beverly Hills Hotel restaurant sat the two famous comedy stars, looking over the menu, when a waiter, who just moved to L.A. from New York, approached them.

“Hello Mr. O’Ryan and Mr. Smigal, I am Billy O’Donnell and I will be helping to serve you today,” said the smiling young Harvard grad, who had aspirations of writing television shows or movies.

“Thanks Billy,” said Conan, also a Harvard man, having graduated magna cum laude and was editor of the Harvard Lampoon. “Well, I know Robert and I would like to try a bottle of your best California Chardonnay and some calamari would be terrific as well.”

“Very good sir, I will be right back with your drinks and appetizer,” he said, then quickly walked to the kitchen. As he entered the right side of the set of swinging kitchen doors, out stepped the cute blonde girl from the left side, carrying a basket of fresh rolls.

“Here you go gentlemen,” she said, the smell of the wonderful oven-baked bread filling the air around them. “And as I mentioned, I am a huge fan of yours and hope you don’t mind if I pass along my resume and audition DVD.” Out of a large pocket in her apron, blondie pulled out a DVD in a colorful plastic case with her name across the front, Whisper Stream.

“Oh thank you,” said Conan, looking at the cover and laughing a bit. “I don’t suppose that’s really your name, is it?”

“Yes, yes it is,” she said, lifting her chin proudly, trying to hide the hurt she was feeling from the question. “My parents knew I would one day become a major movie star, so they gave me that name so I wouldn’t have to think of a stage name later.”

“Good thinking,” said Smigal, trying not to laugh and further offend her.

“Thank you for looking at it,” she said. “I can’t let them see me talking to you like this. I’ll get in trouble.” She left and quickly disappeared through the kitchen door, just as the brunette girl came out the other side and walked directly to Conan’s table.

“Here is the butter and your butter knives,” she said with a wonderful look that had such a tremendous star-quality to it. Smigal and Conan nodded as she walked away, but she quickly turned and came back to the table.

“I apologize,” she said with a very serious look on her face. “That was not the proper way for me to present you with the butter.” She picked up the butter tray, lifted it up near her face and started singing to the music of “I’m So Pretty” from West Side Story as she danced around the table.
“Here’s the butter, tasty butter
Here’s the butter, the butter today!
Here’s your butter, and it’s going to be a tasty day.
La, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la!

“Veronica!” a loud voice blasted across the room from the hostess Barbara.

The singer froze, “Sorry!” Then she addressed the two men. “Gotta go,” and off she scampered.

O’Ryan sat there with a puzzled look on his face. First he had to endure Porche’s boring story on the show that night, then have an audition DVD shoved at him by a woman with a strange name whom he just offended, followed by an unscheduled performance from an Annaleah Folie look-alike doing her rendition of “butter” from West Side Story.

“Robert, did this ever happen to us in New York?” asked the tall pale-faced talk show host, who looks like he should be the spokesperson for the country of Ireland, providing America with its greatest product, talented hard-working people.

“Not that I can remember,” said his long-time Jewish friend, who had grown up in Manhattan.

The two men knew these intrusions would not continue and the dining experience would most definitely get better at this exclusive establishment. It did.

Waiter Billy O’Donnell returned in a very professional manner, showed the two gentlemen the bottle of Robert Mondavi Private Label chardonnay, operated the cork screw like a pro, quickly opening the bottle, presenting the cork to Conan to sniff, while pouring a small sample into Mr. Smigal’s glass for him to taste. The gentlemen nodded their approval, and young O’Donnell poured them both a half glass of wine, placing the bottle into the metal bucket of ice to keep it properly chilled. “Very good gentlemen,” he said in a professional tone, then pulled a fairly thick script out of his jacket and handed it to Conan saying, “And if you have a few minutes, perhaps you can take a read of my script, which would make a wonderful television movie.”

All of a sudden, O’Ryan felt a little numb as he looked up at this nice young fellow, while hoping all the while he would have a chance to have dinner with his friend and discuss his next career move. Stay in L.A. or move back to New York.

“Uh, yeah Billy, I’ll take a read, when I get a chance, thanks,” said an always polite O’Ryan, just as his mother had taught him growing up in the suburbs of Boston.

“Thanks,” said O’Donnell, then turned very professionally and walked back toward the kitchen.

***************************************************************

Back at Guido’s Place in New York, Stewart and Clobear continued their lament about their lack of big time network offers, when they were approached once again by the jovial Italian owner.

“Here ya go gents,” he said, placing the hot steaming food on the table in front of them. “Pasta Fazul for you Soupy and a plate of Lasagna for you Mr. Clobear.” After he placed the plates down he saw the two waiters at the Wall of Fame stacking up the photos they took down.

“Nice photo of Conan, don’t ya tink fellas?” Guido asked his two irritated customers.

“Yeah, great,” said Clobear. “Does he eat here?”

“No, but I was told by a guy dat if we put his photo up, people will tink he does. Good for business, ya know.”

“Yeah, great!” Clobear agreed. “Conan’s a pretty funny guy, huh?’

“Conan?”

“Yeah,” said Clobear, trying to find out what the owner thought of O’Ryan’s comedy talents.

“Never watch ‘em,” admitted Guido. “Personally, I run widda certain crowd, ya know? We love DeNiro in Analyze Dis and Analyze Dat! Now dat’s funny stuff!”

“Those are funny movies,” said Stewart. “But no one here watches The Night Show or Good Night?”

“Is that the red-haired guy?” asked Guido, looking at the picture. “Oh wait, I have watched him. I guess I didn’t put it together. Yeah I love when does that jump,” he said, then tried to re-enact Conan’s signature move.

“Wow that was pretty…uh…pretty something,” Clobear said, amazed at how silly the owner looked trying to recreate the famous move.

“Yeah, I like dat guy,” said Guido. “He’s funny!”

Then something occurred to Clobear, “Guido, do you get cable here?”

“We used to,” said the smiling Italian native. “But the cable company found out and tried to charge us for it. Can you believe dat? I told ‘em, I got your $27.50 right here!” he said grabbing his cable package and shaking it.

“Hey Guido, where da ya wan dees?” asked Fingers McLugnuts, carrying the photos he had taken down from the wall.

“Urinal!” said Guido without skipping a beat.

Stewart and Clobear gave each other a look of great surprise.

“Urinal, nice!” said Clobear. “We’ll be together again Soupy. Just you and me, side by side above the urinals.”

“Hey, I want the first urinal,” said Stewart, his sarcasm once again escaping the owner. “If I can’t have the first pisser, I want no pisser at all.”

“Isn’t that what Nathan Hale once said,” quipped Clobear.

“No, I think that was Nathan Lane,” the diminutive comedy host joked back. “Well Guido, we can’t thank you enough for the wonderful meals you have provided to us free of charge over the last month, but I have to say, this will be our last.”

“Whad da ya kiddin?” he chuckled, thinking this was a joke.

“No, I can live with ball-scratching waiters and stolen wine, but I draw the line at having my photo hung over a urinal,” explained Stewart with a smile, but actually quite serious this time.

“Hey I’m sorry Soupy, I didn’t tink you’d mind,” said Guido. “I mean most of the guys dat come in here will see ya in dere, ya know?”

“I know, it’s a great spot,” said Stewart. “But I think Stephen and me…”

“Stephen and I, ya mean,” interrupted Guido, raising his right index finger to correct the mistake.

“Right, forgot I was talking to a linguist. Stephen and I will try some new restaurants next time. Yes, something new and different, maybe restaurants without code violations, rat-infested walls, good food, real wine, that kind of thing.”

“Right,” said Guido, not too happy to receive so many sarcastic shots aimed at his restaurant. “Sure, why not? You go do dat,” he said now angry, watching the two gentlemen stand up to leave. “And you go head and forgetta bout us, okay? Capice?”

“Capice,” said Stewart, now realizing he had gone too far and offended Guido, which was not a great idea in that part of town. He reached out to shake the owner’s hand, “Hey, no hard feelings, eh Guido?”

Guido just looked at Stewart’s hand, then over at his two waiters, who knew what that look meant and started toward ComedyCenter’s two greatest investments.

“Yeah, we got to go,” said Clobear and the two men quickly, very quickly, walked, then ran out the door, knowing they had better be more careful about taking shots at Italian restaurant owners in Hell’s Kitchen.
As they walked down a darkened 8th Avenue close to midnight, a shaken Stewart turned to his pal, “Stephen, I think we should just move our shows to the West coast, don’t you?” he said still breathing hard from the narrow escape. “Fresh air. Beautiful women everywhere. No one bothering us. Wouldn’t that be the life?”

********************************************************

Whisper Stream placed the dinner plates in front of O’Ryan and Smigal and said, “Please gentlemen, let me know if there is anything else I can get you.” She smiled and slowly backed up a few steps, seemingly not to disturb them any further. As Conan began cutting into his very tender medium-rare, 8-ounce filet mignon, Whisper Stream, asked, “How is your steak, Mr. O’Ryan?” But her voice was different. It was sort of a monotone and had a rhythm to it.

“Oh it looks good,” he said indicating she had asked the question just a bit too early.

“I had a steak earlier today too! Actually I had two steaks. Had two steaks today,” she said in that same monotone voice in that same rhythm. Smigal and O’Ryan immediately recognized what was happening. Good ol’ Whisper Stream was doing an audition piece for them of “Penelope the One-Upper,” the character made famous on Saturday Evening Theater.

Smigal tried to help his friend, “Look Whisper, Conan’s had a long day and if it’s okay with you, we would just like to have our dinner in peace and quiet. You know, no interruptions.”

“I had no interruptions today,” she continued profusely annoying them with the character imitation. “None at all, far fewer than you.”

From the kitchen emerged the young Irish writer O’Donnell, who looked like he would provide some assistance. “Whisper,” he said, sounding stern and determined. “I hope you are conducting yourself appropriately here.”
The actress just looked at him and started to say another monotone lined when he cut her off, asking, “Have you asked Mr. O’Ryan if you could read the first few pages of my script to him? Have you? Hmmm? I think these two gentlemen would enjoy it.”

Smigal looked back for the hostess, hoping to put an end to this unscheduled audition and script-reading. When he turned to look, he saw Veronica the singing waitress and four very effervescent smiling waiters, wearing white top hats and carrying black canes, walking right behind her. Before Smigal could raise his hand to signal for help, Veronica broke into song.

“One singular sensation, every little step she takes,” with the four male dancers holding the brim of their top hats with their left hand, and cane with their right, as they mirrored the dance movements of their star singer in her first performance at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/200905310728460.chorusline4.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/200905310728460.chorusline4-300x200.jpg" alt="200905310728460.chorusline4" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1371" /></a>
“I was in the Chorus Line once,” said Whisper as Veronica and her backup dancers continued the big production number. “Actually, I was on Broadway in the Chorus Line, which is better; ran four years.”

After the first verse, Veronica joined the line in the middle of the four chorus boys. Billy O’Donnell moved quickly to join the line on one end, while Whisper jumped in at the other end, “I can sing too! I’m a great singer, wonderful singer.”

Veronica cut right to the big finish, all seven of them kicking their legs like the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall as Veronica belted out,
“Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention
Do I really have to mention
She's the one!”

The Red-Haired Wonder watched this Hollywood lunacy for a moment, then at his untouched delicious-looking steak. He picked up his napkin and threw it on his plate.

“Robert, I think I have to move back east to New York,” said Conan, standing and walking toward the exit with his friend right beside him, nodding in agreement. “Real people! Energy of the city! Beautiful women everywhere! No one bothering me. Wouldn’t’ that be the life?”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"John Ruane";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39404:"In 2008, I wrote <em>The Wizards of Spin</em> to satirize America's favorite celebrity news and talk show hosts.

Conan has done very well as a talk show host with millions of fans, but in my view, NBC made the wrong choice.

Now, CBS has shown great wisdom in selecting Mr. Colbert to replace the great David Letterman as host of <em>The Late Show</em>. The book was updated last year due to all the changes in the industry, which is reflected in this chapter. The names of celebrities and shows have been altered slightly just to underscore this is satire, however most of it is true with background facts. Here is the chapter. Hope you enjoy it. 

<ul><strong>A TALE OF TWO TALK SHOWS</strong></ul>
It was late on a Friday evening in January of 2010 when two good friends from the popular cable channel ComedyCenter entered their new favorite Italian bistro after finishing the taping of their final show of the week.

Stephen Clobear and Soupy Stewart, two incredibly funny, talented and smart political comedy stars had started a tradition of going out after the final show of the week. Stewart, whose real name is Leftonritz, but had it legally changed because he was tired of all the cracker jokes, can be described as a survivor -- a great entertainment success story.

He grew up in New Jersey and first tried Standup comedy in 1986 under the name Shecky Tuna, bombed, got the nerve to try it again under the name Soupy Stewart and within a few years was soon receiving opportunities to perform on ComedyCenter and Fun TV. In 1993, he was one of the frontrunners for the host of the popular late night talk show, Good Night, after Daniel Littleton bolted to do The Big Show on another network. Instead of Stewart, the executive producer at Good Night selected a writer and producer for Saturday Evening Theater, Conan O’Ryan, to host the national talk show.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/john-stewart.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/john-stewart-239x300.jpg" alt="Jon Stewart Portrait Session" width="239" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1375" /></a>

But the 5’10”, good-looking, energetic and determined neighborhood tiddlywinks champion from New Jersey forged on, and after a few other failed TV gigs, was given the chance to take over the Craig Show on ComedyCenter when that legendary comedy giant, Craig Kiljoy, left for a late night network show.

ComedyCenter renamed the show The Soupy Stewart Show and the comedian soon learned that sometimes it takes more than just a break to achieve success. Sometimes it takes the right break. Stewart was a hit and went on to become one of the most popular television personalities in America, winning Emmy, Peabody, and Grammy awards, not to mention the opportunity to host two Academy Awards shows, perhaps the highest honor given to anyone in his business.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/838-495_StephenColbert.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/838-495_StephenColbert-251x300.jpg" alt="838-495_StephenColbert" width="251" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1368" /></a>

His buddy, Stephen Clobear, has somewhat of a similar story, searching for the right break. He grew up in South Carolina, but went to Northwestern University to study theater and ended up at the famed Compass City Theater where he developed his talent. Later, he took off for New York with a couple of other Compass City comedy actors, where they tried their sketch comedy here and there, and struggled. But in the mid-1990s, Clobear started catching a few breaks, hired as a writer for Saturday Evening Theater, often referred to as SET, then the short-lived Dana Harvey Show and finally The Soupy Stewart Show.

Working with Soupy, Clobear developed his on-air right wing republican character, a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly, and his star rose quickly. He became so popular, ComedyCenter spun off his character into a new show he would host called, The Clobear Report, which has become a highly successful, and often quoted show on real national news shows.

On this Friday evening, the two tired national comedy stars made their way to Guido’s Place, a restaurant Stewart happened into about a month earlier after he had taken a wrong turn into a not so nice section of Hell’s Kitchen off 8th Avenue. That evening, the owner, one Guido Manilucci, offered him dinner on the house and asked for a photo he could hang up in the center of the Wall of Fame, the most prominent place.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/mediumhellskitchenvincent-des-jardins.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/mediumhellskitchenvincent-des-jardins-300x200.jpg" alt="mediumhellskitchen(vincent des jardins)" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1374" /></a>

This pleasant and affordable experience led Stewart to start frequenting the dining establishment, despite the neighborhood, decorum, food and so on. Free food and his photo on the wall, why not? A few weeks later, he decided to make it the Friday dinner spot for him and his pal from South Carolina.

Guido, a lifelong New Yorker, spotted the two cable talk show giants entering the front door and quickly walked up to greet them.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/87514673df7b4ebc.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/87514673df7b4ebc-300x199.jpg" alt="-87514673df7b4ebc" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1370" /></a>

“Stephen and Soupy, hey how’s it going, eh?” said the middle-aged, overweight, mustached and jovial owner with a heavy New York accent. “Ya know I got your favorite table open.”

“Hey thanks Guido,” said Stewart, smiling, but looking tired from a tough week of being funny and smart, not easy in any business, but really difficult when a million people are watching you attempt it each night. “I am starved!”

“Me too!” said Clobear, following Stewart and Guido to the back of the restaurant and a small table with two rickety old chairs in a corner with red brick walls on each side, decorated only by a few lit candles, some of which were duct taped to stay in place. “Why don’t you have the chef start cookin’ up our favorites?”

“Yes,” added Stewart. “And I know Stephen and I would like a glass of your finest grape, as always, Guido my good man.”

“Hey dat sounds good Soupy,” said Guido, shrugging his shoulders, and then tilting his head from side to side, the nervous mannerisms he exhibits every time he addresses someone. “I will get on it right away. Youz twos guys go ahead and sit down, I’ll have dat bottle of chardonnay out here before you can tuck your napkin in, you know? Hey you know what I mean? Before you can tuck your napkin in. Know what I’m saying?”

“We got you gumba,” laughed Stewart whose fairly large nicely framed photo hung on the wall opposite his table. Guido was always eager to let guests know this was Soupy Stewart’s favorite hangout and THE table where he ate his meals. He never saw Soupy’s show, not once, but a young bartender, Billy O’Donnell, filled him in the show and its famous host.

“Soupy when are they going to put my photo up there?” asked Clobear, looking at the Wall of Fame where Stewart’s photo took the most prominent position at the center, surrounded by several other photos of local news celebrities in town. On the right of his signed ComedyCenter mugshot was a framed Polaroid photo of Mike Smithson, an associate producer for the 5 a.m. news at WMBC-TV. To the left was a coffee-stained photo of Mary O’Neil, the receptionist at WOOR-TV. And right below was a police lineup profile photo of the always recognized, Marty Forkin, the security guard at FLUX News for about five weeks in the late 1990s. Yes, this was a group Stewart was proud to be among, no question about it.

Clobear struggled with the thinking behind the pecking order at the restaurant.

“I gave them a signed photo a few weeks ago,” said The Clobear Report’s star, not accustomed to being snubbed by anyone, especially the owner of a rat-infested restaurant.

“The photo is up Stephen,” informed his pal. “I saw it. A beautiful spot, right over the urinal.”

“Hah, hah, you are a funny man Soupy,” chuckled Clobear, organizing the salt and pepper shakers on the table so they were lined up correctly with the napkin holder.

“I’m not kidding,” he said with a straight face. “They have no idea who you are.”

“What?”

“They had no idea who I was either until they hired a college kid to tend bar, who told them about me and the show. Unfortunately, Billy O’Donnell only lasted two days, because he couldn’t converse with Guido and his staff about network TV shows like COPS, Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune. He never watched them. Too bad you weren’t with me the first day I came here. Your picture would be right up there with mine for all of the half-wits, nitwits and dimwits that come in this place to admire. Isn’t that what it’s all about?”

Clobear rolled his eyes, adjusted his glasses and took a sip of the water when he couldn’t help but notice the waiter serving the food at a table in front of them. “Oh my God, it’s him!”

Stewart looked over to see a dark-haired, overweight, 40-something waiter with a sagging and red-splotched apron around his waist serving the plates of pasta to an odd looking couple a few tables away -- an old businessman with a young woman that didn’t seem to be his daughter.

“Do you think they know?” asked Stewart.

“No way,” said Clobear, watching the waiter walk away from the couple’s table, back toward the kitchen area. He stopped at a station that had stacked 8-ounce glasses and large plastic pitchers of water. “Here it comes.”

“Wouldn’t’ be any fun coming here, if he didn’t” said Stewart, who watched the waiter take a pitcher, pour a glass of water, then stand up straight drinking the glass of water in his left hand, while he used his right hand to violently adjust his personal equipment, then readjust it, then went deep sea diving into his pants to make sure his moray eel was properly cared for.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/20071204-037.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/20071204-037-300x238.jpg" alt="20071204-037" width="300" height="238" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1369" /></a>

Stewart and Clobear couldn’t help laughing at this incredibly disgusting ritual which they had watched many times, but never had the heart to tell any of the other customers prior to being served.

“Oh that’s new!” said Clobear, seeing the waiter do a two-thumbed scratch of the lower groin, finishing with a satisfied and audible, “Ahhh!”

“He should, write a book about best ways to scratch and adjust, don’t you think Stephen?” asked Stewart. “I’d book ‘em.”

Guido returned to the table and showed the two political comedy news stars a bottle of chardonnay. “Hey, dis is some of our best stuff right here guys. Youz guys are gonna luv dis!”

Clobear looked at the label as Guido turned the twist cap off of the wine bottle, “Ah yes,” he said. “2008 was a very good year! Last year, wasn’t it?”

“I’m tellin’ ya, you will luv dis!” said Guido. “Troot is, I donno ‘xactly where it comes from, but I know our guys get it off da back of a truck in da Bronx.”

“May I sniff the twistoff cap?” asked Stewart, sharing his sarcastic humor with his comedy pal, knowing it would sail right over Guido’s balding head. Clobear just put his head down and laughed, but stopped abruptly as a disturbing thought occurred to him.

“Hey Guido, I know you are aware of this, but just so there are no mixups,” said the ultra neat and clean Clobear with a look of concern on his face. “We always like you to serve our food, right? I mean you know that, don’t you?”

“I take great pride in serving youz two guys,” said Guido.

“We appreciate that,” Stewart smiled. “We just wouldn’t want that other waiter over there serving us, if it’s okay with you?”

Guido looked back over his shoulder to see the waiter Stewart was referring, now talking with a younger waiter at the water station.

“Do you mean Joey over there?” he asked, pointing toward the two men.

“Well I don’t know his name,” said Stewart, then seeing the waiter now demonstrating the two-hand grab and tug adjustment. “There, him! Tommy Tug-a-lot over there.”

Chuckling, Clobear couldn’t help but assist, “Yes, he means Sammy Scrotum Shiner there.”

Stewart wouldn’t be one-upped, “Tug McBall Scratcher.”

“Thumbs McCrank Yanker,” laughed Clobear.

“We’re like a couple of fifth graders, aren’t we Stephen?” Stewart said to his amused pal.

“We are, but we’re funny fifth graders and we get paid millions of dollars,” said the dark-haired king of dry, straight-faced humor. “Who would have thought our little wise-guy antics in grade school would take us so far, eh?”

Guido looked over at his two waiters and figured out to whom they were referring. “Hey Bobby,” he yelled across the room. “Would you mind getting your damn hands outta your pants! This is a restaurant. People eat dat food ya serve.”<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/jon.stewart.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/jon.stewart-300x168.jpg" alt="Jon Stewart Portrait Session" width="300" height="168" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1376" /></a>

The odd looking couple that had just been served stopped mid-chew to look up at the waiter, saw him finishing an intense game of pocket pool, put their forks down, spit the food into their napkins and called for the check.

“Scuse me gents,” said Guido, who went over to the table to talk to his now-sickened customers.

Clobear took a sip of the wine and remarked, “This is good, if you like turpentine.”

“Oh, I love turpentine,” quipped the graying Soupy Stewart Show host, looking around to make sure no-one could hear him, then spoke in a low tone of voice. “Hey Stephen, let me ask you a pretty sensitive question, if you don’t mind?”

Clobear realizing the funny had left the room for a moment and it was time for a serious conversation said, “Sure, what’s up?”

“Well, this must stay between you and me, right?”

Guido turned from the odd couples’ table and said to Stewart, “Don’t you mean to say, you and I? Ya know?”

“Wow that’s the worst case of elephant ears I’ve ever witnessed,” said a concerned looking Stewart, who lowered his head and voice even further.

“Look, no problem Soupy, go ahead,” Clobear responded, confident he would keep any secret for the man who gave him his big break in the entertainment business.

“Well, we are both really funny, right?” Stewart began.

“Right,” agreed Clobear.

“I mean, critics, viewers, everyone seems to think our shows are incredibly funny, right? That’s the same input you get, isn’t it? It’s what we have heard for several years. It’s why I get asked to host the Academy Awards and so on, right?”

“Yes, absolutely,” Clobear agreed once more, now wondering where Soupy was going with this line of questioning.

“Well, wouldn’t you think one of the networks would have made one of us, or both of us, an offer by now to take our shows to a larger audience?” asked a bewildered-looking Stewart. “I mean let’s be honest. Some of the network guys aren’t really that funny and they seem to be getting a real shot at the big-time. I love ComedyCenter and the opportunity they have given us, but it has somewhat of a limited reach, wouldn’t you agree?”

Clobear sat and considered this logic for a moment, then said, “Soupy, honestly, I think our shows are too irreverent, too controversial for the average network viewer. I don’t think you can be as politically disruptive as we are when you are on one of the three major networks. You can’t forget Soupy, our humor and views appeal to a certain audience -- college students, college graduates now in the business world who are sharp, smart people. They read the news, know what’s going on. They get it. A lot of the folks in the rural areas, and even the cities -- as we both witnessed tonight -- don’t get cable or satellite TV and depend on the networks for their programs. Do you really think a lot of those folks would like our humor? Heck no! They would hate us!”

Stewart knew his pal was right, but struggled with the idea that lesser talented comedians were getting those more prominent network slots in front of them. Not to mention the big money!

Clobear continued, “The networks need someone who can appeal to that general audience. Safer humor that will entertain without offending, keeping the ratings.”

“Even if they aren’t that funny?” asked Stewart.

“Like who?” wondered Clobear, who certainly had his own list on the subject.

“Well, I don’t want to name any names, but…” Stewart stopped when he saw the young waiter and Lance McItchy walk past them carrying a very large golden frame toward the Wall of Fame. The two waiters placed the framed photo on the floor, leaning it against the wall, while they took down the four big local celebs, including Stewart, to make room. Then they hung the new photo.

“Hey excuse me, Tug McBall Scratcher, what are you doing?” asked Stewart, who was in no mood to see his photo removed from the wall of the Condessa Del Firetrap.

“Owner said we needs to put dis new one up,” said the walking restaurant code-violation. And there, taking Stewart’s place on the wall, was an all-too-familiar face. A man they both called a friend, Conan O’Ryan.

“Well, that’s nice,” said Stewart with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. “First he gets to host Good Night, then The Night Show and now my spot on a wall in a restaurant that no respectable celebrity would venture into.”

“He is our friend,” reminded Clobear. “We should just be happy for him.”

“Yes, I know,” said Soupy, grimacing as Guido returned to the table. “I’m just ecstatic!”
********************************************************************
At this same moment in Beverly Hills, California, it was nearly 7 p.m. and Conan O’Ryan had just finished taping The Night Show for his final show of the week with guests Rice Weatherspoon and Porche Delray. The beautiful and always engaging Weatherspoon had put O’Ryan into a great mood which was quickly dissipated by Delray, who told an incredibly stupid story that went on and on about taking her dog for a walk, ended up at a friend’s gated home, where she was not invited, but entered the grounds, where her dog got away, and a security camera followed her while she looked at the security pad on the stone fence column and oh my goodness, O’Ryan was ready to hang himself listening to her.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/conan-obrien-1-sized.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/conan-obrien-1-sized-236x300.jpg" alt="conan-obrien-1-sized" width="236" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1373" /></a>

Off to the sanctuary of the posh restaurant at the Beverly Hills Hotel where O’Ryan was scheduled to meet his longtime friend, Robert Smigal, for dinner. The two successful comedy stars were greeted at the door immediately by a beautiful and sophisticated host named Barbara, who was surrounded by an always-professional staff, some of whom just happened to be big Conan O’Ryan fans. One, a very cute blonde waitress, offered to show the famed talk show host and his friend to the best seat in the restaurant looking out at the beautiful garden area, which was lit wonderfully by the setting sun.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/4c5d21e8e8c6d8589cfb0063f12395ab5bc83ec8d324678d92f7318e.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/4c5d21e8e8c6d8589cfb0063f12395ab5bc83ec8d324678d92f7318e-257x300.jpg" alt="4c5d21e8e8c6d8589cfb0063f12395ab5bc83ec8d324678d92f7318e" width="257" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1366" /></a>

“Right this way Mr. O’Ryan,” said the waitress, dressed in short light brown coat, white collared shirt, brown bow tie and matching brown skirt, presenting a very impressive and professional-looking uniform.

“So honored to have you join us,” said a beautiful brunette girl who joined her associate to help seat O’Ryan and his friend, who they didn’t recognize. The brunette waitress was a stunning beauty, who could have been international film star Annaleah Folie’s double – someone who should be starring in movies, not seating talk show hosts at a restaurant.

When they reached the soft light green padded semi-circular booth, the blonde girl lost her composure for just a moment and made an inappropriate request, “Mr. O’Ryan, would you mind?” she began, then looked like she was reconsidering her request. “Can you do the jump for me? Would you mind? I love the jump!”

The always-polite New Englander didn’t blink, got into his low crouch with arms bent back for thrust and sprang forward, launching himself a full six inches, then spun pointing at the young lady. This was the move that has become the Red-Haired Wonder’s signature, like Johnny Carson’s golf swing.

The celebrity frenzy had begun and the brunette was not to be denied. “Can I touch your…?” she asked holding her right hand out toward his famous red locks.”

“Sure why not,” he said, feeling her very lovely hand make it’s way through his thick long red hair. Somehow, this request was all-too familiar and when beauties like this made the request, the great O’Ryan had to remind himself about his lovely wife Judy and two young children, Brady and Josh, back at home.

As he sat down, he began to wonder if Hollywood was becoming a prison for him. Knowing he was leaving The Night Show in only a few weeks, he was now in a position where he had to make a decision about his future. In New York, he could usually walk down the streets without too much harassment outside of, “Hi Conan! How’s it going Conan! Red Sox suck Conan!” Although he was from Boston and a Red Sox fan, New Yorkers considered him one of them, which is a unique allowance for New Yorkers, especially when it comes to the Red Sox. Should he go back east to relaunch his career or stay in L.A?

O’Ryan’s friend, Smigal, was visiting from New Jersey and is rarely recognized on the street. His success evolved from the legendary sketches he wrote for Saturday Evening Theater and later the off-beat TV Funtime cartoon segments on SET that have made his name famous. And if the young wait staff at the restaurant were to learn that Smigal was the creator of Victory the Rude Funny Pup, all hell would break loose and he would be signing autographs for hours.

In an industry where true loyalty is rare, Conan felt a very strong bond to his dark curly-haired, middle-aged friend, who is considered a genius by many in the entertainment industry. Smigal played a significant role in Conan’s success, lobbying producer Loren Michaelson to hire his SET writing buddy for the Good Night host job, knowing Conan would excel in that chair. And when Conan was selected, Smigal joined him at Good Night to help make the show a success with incredibly zany comedy bits, which have become famous throughout America starting with the “lips” segments, which would featured a large celebrity photo with the lips cut out, so Smigal could mouth crazy dialogue in a conversation with Conan.

Many at SET believed that Conan was born to be a talk show host, recognizing O’Ryan’s ability to talk to people, interview them, sincerely listening and staying within the moment of the conversation, following up with good questions pertaining directly to the specific details being shared that moment. His talent wasn’t that of a great comedian. It was his people skills, interview skills, plus knowing how to play his part within a comedy bit.

O’Ryan could never touch the talents of seasoned standup comedians like Jay Leno or David Letterman. Or the great comic talents of Stephen Clobear or Soupy Stewart for that matter. No, the Red-Haired Wonder’s talents become apparent the second he sits in the talk show hosts chair where his genuinely warm personality and likeability become apparent.

So there in the Beverly Hills Hotel restaurant sat the two famous comedy stars, looking over the menu, when a waiter, who just moved to L.A. from New York, approached them.

“Hello Mr. O’Ryan and Mr. Smigal, I am Billy O’Donnell and I will be helping to serve you today,” said the smiling young Harvard grad, who had aspirations of writing television shows or movies.

“Thanks Billy,” said Conan, also a Harvard man, having graduated magna cum laude and was editor of the Harvard Lampoon. “Well, I know Robert and I would like to try a bottle of your best California Chardonnay and some calamari would be terrific as well.”

“Very good sir, I will be right back with your drinks and appetizer,” he said, then quickly walked to the kitchen. As he entered the right side of the set of swinging kitchen doors, out stepped the cute blonde girl from the left side, carrying a basket of fresh rolls.

“Here you go gentlemen,” she said, the smell of the wonderful oven-baked bread filling the air around them. “And as I mentioned, I am a huge fan of yours and hope you don’t mind if I pass along my resume and audition DVD.” Out of a large pocket in her apron, blondie pulled out a DVD in a colorful plastic case with her name across the front, Whisper Stream.

“Oh thank you,” said Conan, looking at the cover and laughing a bit. “I don’t suppose that’s really your name, is it?”

“Yes, yes it is,” she said, lifting her chin proudly, trying to hide the hurt she was feeling from the question. “My parents knew I would one day become a major movie star, so they gave me that name so I wouldn’t have to think of a stage name later.”

“Good thinking,” said Smigal, trying not to laugh and further offend her.

“Thank you for looking at it,” she said. “I can’t let them see me talking to you like this. I’ll get in trouble.” She left and quickly disappeared through the kitchen door, just as the brunette girl came out the other side and walked directly to Conan’s table.

“Here is the butter and your butter knives,” she said with a wonderful look that had such a tremendous star-quality to it. Smigal and Conan nodded as she walked away, but she quickly turned and came back to the table.

“I apologize,” she said with a very serious look on her face. “That was not the proper way for me to present you with the butter.” She picked up the butter tray, lifted it up near her face and started singing to the music of “I’m So Pretty” from West Side Story as she danced around the table.
“Here’s the butter, tasty butter
Here’s the butter, the butter today!
Here’s your butter, and it’s going to be a tasty day.
La, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la!

“Veronica!” a loud voice blasted across the room from the hostess Barbara.

The singer froze, “Sorry!” Then she addressed the two men. “Gotta go,” and off she scampered.

O’Ryan sat there with a puzzled look on his face. First he had to endure Porche’s boring story on the show that night, then have an audition DVD shoved at him by a woman with a strange name whom he just offended, followed by an unscheduled performance from an Annaleah Folie look-alike doing her rendition of “butter” from West Side Story.

“Robert, did this ever happen to us in New York?” asked the tall pale-faced talk show host, who looks like he should be the spokesperson for the country of Ireland, providing America with its greatest product, talented hard-working people.

“Not that I can remember,” said his long-time Jewish friend, who had grown up in Manhattan.

The two men knew these intrusions would not continue and the dining experience would most definitely get better at this exclusive establishment. It did.

Waiter Billy O’Donnell returned in a very professional manner, showed the two gentlemen the bottle of Robert Mondavi Private Label chardonnay, operated the cork screw like a pro, quickly opening the bottle, presenting the cork to Conan to sniff, while pouring a small sample into Mr. Smigal’s glass for him to taste. The gentlemen nodded their approval, and young O’Donnell poured them both a half glass of wine, placing the bottle into the metal bucket of ice to keep it properly chilled. “Very good gentlemen,” he said in a professional tone, then pulled a fairly thick script out of his jacket and handed it to Conan saying, “And if you have a few minutes, perhaps you can take a read of my script, which would make a wonderful television movie.”

All of a sudden, O’Ryan felt a little numb as he looked up at this nice young fellow, while hoping all the while he would have a chance to have dinner with his friend and discuss his next career move. Stay in L.A. or move back to New York.

“Uh, yeah Billy, I’ll take a read, when I get a chance, thanks,” said an always polite O’Ryan, just as his mother had taught him growing up in the suburbs of Boston.

“Thanks,” said O’Donnell, then turned very professionally and walked back toward the kitchen.

***************************************************************

Back at Guido’s Place in New York, Stewart and Clobear continued their lament about their lack of big time network offers, when they were approached once again by the jovial Italian owner.

“Here ya go gents,” he said, placing the hot steaming food on the table in front of them. “Pasta Fazul for you Soupy and a plate of Lasagna for you Mr. Clobear.” After he placed the plates down he saw the two waiters at the Wall of Fame stacking up the photos they took down.

“Nice photo of Conan, don’t ya tink fellas?” Guido asked his two irritated customers.

“Yeah, great,” said Clobear. “Does he eat here?”

“No, but I was told by a guy dat if we put his photo up, people will tink he does. Good for business, ya know.”

“Yeah, great!” Clobear agreed. “Conan’s a pretty funny guy, huh?’

“Conan?”

“Yeah,” said Clobear, trying to find out what the owner thought of O’Ryan’s comedy talents.

“Never watch ‘em,” admitted Guido. “Personally, I run widda certain crowd, ya know? We love DeNiro in Analyze Dis and Analyze Dat! Now dat’s funny stuff!”

“Those are funny movies,” said Stewart. “But no one here watches The Night Show or Good Night?”

“Is that the red-haired guy?” asked Guido, looking at the picture. “Oh wait, I have watched him. I guess I didn’t put it together. Yeah I love when does that jump,” he said, then tried to re-enact Conan’s signature move.

“Wow that was pretty…uh…pretty something,” Clobear said, amazed at how silly the owner looked trying to recreate the famous move.

“Yeah, I like dat guy,” said Guido. “He’s funny!”

Then something occurred to Clobear, “Guido, do you get cable here?”

“We used to,” said the smiling Italian native. “But the cable company found out and tried to charge us for it. Can you believe dat? I told ‘em, I got your $27.50 right here!” he said grabbing his cable package and shaking it.

“Hey Guido, where da ya wan dees?” asked Fingers McLugnuts, carrying the photos he had taken down from the wall.

“Urinal!” said Guido without skipping a beat.

Stewart and Clobear gave each other a look of great surprise.

“Urinal, nice!” said Clobear. “We’ll be together again Soupy. Just you and me, side by side above the urinals.”

“Hey, I want the first urinal,” said Stewart, his sarcasm once again escaping the owner. “If I can’t have the first pisser, I want no pisser at all.”

“Isn’t that what Nathan Hale once said,” quipped Clobear.

“No, I think that was Nathan Lane,” the diminutive comedy host joked back. “Well Guido, we can’t thank you enough for the wonderful meals you have provided to us free of charge over the last month, but I have to say, this will be our last.”

“Whad da ya kiddin?” he chuckled, thinking this was a joke.

“No, I can live with ball-scratching waiters and stolen wine, but I draw the line at having my photo hung over a urinal,” explained Stewart with a smile, but actually quite serious this time.

“Hey I’m sorry Soupy, I didn’t tink you’d mind,” said Guido. “I mean most of the guys dat come in here will see ya in dere, ya know?”

“I know, it’s a great spot,” said Stewart. “But I think Stephen and me…”

“Stephen and I, ya mean,” interrupted Guido, raising his right index finger to correct the mistake.

“Right, forgot I was talking to a linguist. Stephen and I will try some new restaurants next time. Yes, something new and different, maybe restaurants without code violations, rat-infested walls, good food, real wine, that kind of thing.”

“Right,” said Guido, not too happy to receive so many sarcastic shots aimed at his restaurant. “Sure, why not? You go do dat,” he said now angry, watching the two gentlemen stand up to leave. “And you go head and forgetta bout us, okay? Capice?”

“Capice,” said Stewart, now realizing he had gone too far and offended Guido, which was not a great idea in that part of town. He reached out to shake the owner’s hand, “Hey, no hard feelings, eh Guido?”

Guido just looked at Stewart’s hand, then over at his two waiters, who knew what that look meant and started toward ComedyCenter’s two greatest investments.

“Yeah, we got to go,” said Clobear and the two men quickly, very quickly, walked, then ran out the door, knowing they had better be more careful about taking shots at Italian restaurant owners in Hell’s Kitchen.
As they walked down a darkened 8th Avenue close to midnight, a shaken Stewart turned to his pal, “Stephen, I think we should just move our shows to the West coast, don’t you?” he said still breathing hard from the narrow escape. “Fresh air. Beautiful women everywhere. No one bothering us. Wouldn’t that be the life?”

********************************************************

Whisper Stream placed the dinner plates in front of O’Ryan and Smigal and said, “Please gentlemen, let me know if there is anything else I can get you.” She smiled and slowly backed up a few steps, seemingly not to disturb them any further. As Conan began cutting into his very tender medium-rare, 8-ounce filet mignon, Whisper Stream, asked, “How is your steak, Mr. O’Ryan?” But her voice was different. It was sort of a monotone and had a rhythm to it.

“Oh it looks good,” he said indicating she had asked the question just a bit too early.

“I had a steak earlier today too! Actually I had two steaks. Had two steaks today,” she said in that same monotone voice in that same rhythm. Smigal and O’Ryan immediately recognized what was happening. Good ol’ Whisper Stream was doing an audition piece for them of “Penelope the One-Upper,” the character made famous on Saturday Evening Theater.

Smigal tried to help his friend, “Look Whisper, Conan’s had a long day and if it’s okay with you, we would just like to have our dinner in peace and quiet. You know, no interruptions.”

“I had no interruptions today,” she continued profusely annoying them with the character imitation. “None at all, far fewer than you.”

From the kitchen emerged the young Irish writer O’Donnell, who looked like he would provide some assistance. “Whisper,” he said, sounding stern and determined. “I hope you are conducting yourself appropriately here.”
The actress just looked at him and started to say another monotone lined when he cut her off, asking, “Have you asked Mr. O’Ryan if you could read the first few pages of my script to him? Have you? Hmmm? I think these two gentlemen would enjoy it.”

Smigal looked back for the hostess, hoping to put an end to this unscheduled audition and script-reading. When he turned to look, he saw Veronica the singing waitress and four very effervescent smiling waiters, wearing white top hats and carrying black canes, walking right behind her. Before Smigal could raise his hand to signal for help, Veronica broke into song.

“One singular sensation, every little step she takes,” with the four male dancers holding the brim of their top hats with their left hand, and cane with their right, as they mirrored the dance movements of their star singer in her first performance at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/200905310728460.chorusline4.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/09/200905310728460.chorusline4-300x200.jpg" alt="200905310728460.chorusline4" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1371" /></a>
“I was in the Chorus Line once,” said Whisper as Veronica and her backup dancers continued the big production number. “Actually, I was on Broadway in the Chorus Line, which is better; ran four years.”

After the first verse, Veronica joined the line in the middle of the four chorus boys. Billy O’Donnell moved quickly to join the line on one end, while Whisper jumped in at the other end, “I can sing too! I’m a great singer, wonderful singer.”

Veronica cut right to the big finish, all seven of them kicking their legs like the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall as Veronica belted out,
“Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention
Do I really have to mention
She's the one!”

The Red-Haired Wonder watched this Hollywood lunacy for a moment, then at his untouched delicious-looking steak. He picked up his napkin and threw it on his plate.

“Robert, I think I have to move back east to New York,” said Conan, standing and walking toward the exit with his friend right beside him, nodding in agreement. “Real people! Energy of the city! Beautiful women everywhere! No one bothering me.

He can't be termed a politician, because he is the furthest thing from that concept. 

If you have watched his antics over these last two Presidential primaries, it's pretty difficult to take him seriously. However, Mr. Trump's statements two days ago in an interview with Bill O'Reilly, followed by his speech in Iowa yesterday, changed that circus-act perception for me.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Trump-on-Oreilly.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Trump-on-Oreilly.jpg" alt="Trump on O&#039;reilly" width="215" height="121" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1347" /></a>

In the O'Reilly interview and then the Iowa speech, Donald Trump hit several hot button issues for many Americans and told the country how he will fix their problems.

Here are the issues he addressed:
1. "China has taken our jobs, our manufacturing but we owe them trillions. How does that work? Is that magic act? For companies that want to keep sending their jobs overseas to China or down to Mexico, I'll send my top negotiators in, and believe me, these guys are sharks - tough guys - and believe me they will get a deal done that will bring the jobs back to America and make this country great again."
2. "I am going to have gangs out of here faster than you can turn your head."
3.  "When I am elected President, Ford and Nabisco won't be building factories in Mexico, because I would set a 35% rate on everything they try to sell back to America. They'll be building their car manufacturing plants here and keeping them here."
4. "We send our kids to college and they build up a massive debt. Then after they graduate, they can't find jobs because they have been shipped overseas. I'll end that and bring the jobs back to America."
5. "I am going to build a really high wall across the border so no-one from Mexico can illegally come into our country. The Chinese built the Great Wall of China and that worked pretty well for them. I'm going to do even better."
6. "I don't take money from lobbyists. I was offered five million from a guy, a really nice guy, I know him, and I turned him down. Am I stupid? I don't think so. I'm just not going to have him walk into my office two years after I'm President and tell me what I have to do. Meanwhile, the other candidates are taking that money and guess what? When Ford says I want to keep the factory in Mexico, they'll say okay because the lobbyist already helped fund their campaigns." <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Hillary.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Hillary.jpg" alt="Hillary" width="261" height="193" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1348" /></a>

A few weeks ago, I wrote that Donald Trump would only last six months. Based on what he has done this week, I would have to say that my speculation is dead wrong. Those messages have great appeal for a lot of Americans who are fed up with bought-and-paid-for politicians. Hillary Clinton is the epitome of the prototypical politician and every time Donald Trump gives a talk like he did in Iowa, she looks worse to anyone who is an independent or conservative. Left-wing liberals will continue to support her, even though she is standing behind Planned Parenthood and their horrific actions and attitude selling parts of aborted babies. 
 
In 1992, Ross Perot - another millionaire - ran for President and like Trump, told it like he saw it. He was a bit more of a politician than Trump, but perhaps it was Perot's GOP run that really paved the way for The Donald. More likely, it's millions of Americans who are hurting right now, losing their jobs and watching their kids come out of college with little hope for landing a job. Longtime U.S. Senator, Bill Bradley, a man of great integrity, has said that today, U.S. Senators and Representatives in Congress spend about four days of their week out seeking campaign contributions. Seeking large campaign contributions is pretty much a fulltime time job for everyone other than Trump, who is running for President. They are accepting large campaign contributions to give themselves a chance to win the White House. So all of the Congress people, all of those candidates for President who are taking the contributions, common sense tells you there will be a price tag attached by the contributors. As Trump says, those contributors are going to come knocking when they need something done. He says he knows, because he used to be the king of contributors. He knows how it works.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Megyn-Kelly.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Megyn-Kelly-300x200.jpg" alt="Megyn Kelly" width="300" height="200" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1309" /></a>
Now here's the other point. Donald Trump started his day off yesterday, taking a shot on Twitter at popular FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly, who asked him a few tough questions during the debate, which he was offended by. Then he holds a press conference and has a well-known Latino anchorman form Univision escorted out of the press conference because he was trying to get Trump to answer his statements regarding deporting Hispanics. The fact that none of this is hurting Trump in the polls tells us that many Americans don't have problem with any of those actions. It tells us many Americans are rightfully more concerned about bringing jobs back to America, than Donald Trump's behavior with the news media. And if it takes a rude, crude, obnoxious, self-centered President to do it, they have his vote.

The normal rules of politics are out the window here. The question is, are there enough Americans who believe Donald Trump can do what he says he will do if he is elected President. I no longer believe that he can't win. If his support in the polls continues to grow, which based on this week I believe it will, it may be Trump versus Hillary for the nomination.

He can't be termed a politician, because he is the furthest thing from that concept. 

If you have watched his antics over these last two Presidential primaries, it's pretty difficult to take him seriously. However, Mr. Trump's statements two days ago in an interview with Bill O'Reilly, followed by his speech in Iowa yesterday, changed that circus-act perception for me.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Trump-on-Oreilly.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Trump-on-Oreilly.jpg" alt="Trump on O&#039;reilly" width="215" height="121" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1347" /></a>

In the O'Reilly interview and then the Iowa speech, Donald Trump hit several hot button issues for many Americans and told the country how he will fix their problems.

Here are the issues he addressed:
1. "China has taken our jobs, our manufacturing but we owe them trillions. How does that work? Is that magic act? For companies that want to keep sending their jobs overseas to China or down to Mexico, I'll send my top negotiators in, and believe me, these guys are sharks - tough guys - and believe me they will get a deal done that will bring the jobs back to America and make this country great again."
2. "I am going to have gangs out of here faster than you can turn your head."
3.  "When I am elected President, Ford and Nabisco won't be building factories in Mexico, because I would set a 35% rate on everything they try to sell back to America. They'll be building their car manufacturing plants here and keeping them here."
4. "We send our kids to college and they build up a massive debt. Then after they graduate, they can't find jobs because they have been shipped overseas. I'll end that and bring the jobs back to America."
5. "I am going to build a really high wall across the border so no-one from Mexico can illegally come into our country. The Chinese built the Great Wall of China and that worked pretty well for them. I'm going to do even better."
6. "I don't take money from lobbyists. I was offered five million from a guy, a really nice guy, I know him, and I turned him down. Am I stupid? I don't think so. I'm just not going to have him walk into my office two years after I'm President and tell me what I have to do. Meanwhile, the other candidates are taking that money and guess what? When Ford says I want to keep the factory in Mexico, they'll say okay because the lobbyist already helped fund their campaigns." <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Hillary.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Hillary.jpg" alt="Hillary" width="261" height="193" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1348" /></a>

A few weeks ago, I wrote that Donald Trump would only last six months. Based on what he has done this week, I would have to say that my speculation is dead wrong. Those messages have great appeal for a lot of Americans who are fed up with bought-and-paid-for politicians. Hillary Clinton is the epitome of the prototypical politician and every time Donald Trump gives a talk like he did in Iowa, she looks worse to anyone who is an independent or conservative. Left-wing liberals will continue to support her, even though she is standing behind Planned Parenthood and their horrific actions and attitude selling parts of aborted babies. 
 
In 1992, Ross Perot - another millionaire - ran for President and like Trump, told it like he saw it. He was a bit more of a politician than Trump, but perhaps it was Perot's GOP run that really paved the way for The Donald. More likely, it's millions of Americans who are hurting right now, losing their jobs and watching their kids come out of college with little hope for landing a job. Longtime U.S. Senator, Bill Bradley, a man of great integrity, has said that today, U.S. Senators and Representatives in Congress spend about four days of their week out seeking campaign contributions. Seeking large campaign contributions is pretty much a fulltime time job for everyone other than Trump, who is running for President. They are accepting large campaign contributions to give themselves a chance to win the White House. So all of the Congress people, all of those candidates for President who are taking the contributions, common sense tells you there will be a price tag attached by the contributors. As Trump says, those contributors are going to come knocking when they need something done. He says he knows, because he used to be the king of contributors. He knows how it works.

Now here's the other point. Donald Trump started his day off yesterday, taking a shot on Twitter at popular FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly, who asked him a few tough questions during the debate, which he was offended by. Then he holds a press conference and has a well-known Latino anchorman form Univision escorted out of the press conference because he was trying to get Trump to answer his statements regarding deporting Hispanics. The fact that none of this is hurting Trump in the polls tells us that many Americans don't have problem with any of those actions. It tells us many Americans are rightfully more concerned about bringing jobs back to America, than Donald Trump's behavior with the news media. And if it takes a rude, crude, obnoxious, self-centered President to do it, they have his vote.

After 13 years since news of the scandal broke, we have reached a point in time when Catholics worldwide are beginning to feel much better about the Church beginning with the moment that puff of white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel on March 13, 2013. When Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis, it signaled a new day for Catholics across the world, many of whom had become disenchanted and stopped attending mass.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Pope-Francis-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.chicagonow.com/newsboy/files/2015/08/Pope-Francis-3-300x225.jpg" alt="Pope-Francis-3" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1277" /></a>

Over the course of the past two years, Pope Francis has been working to transition the Church as a perfect reflection of Jesus Christ, ridding the 2000 year-old institution of entrenched hypocritical habits, questionable business practices, criminal actions and cover-ups. It has been Pope Francis’ efforts to “clean house” that have Catholics, lapsed-Catholics and non-Catholics paying attention to the Pope and the Catholic Church with a new optimism. Pope Francis has a big job ahead of him and it will take time, but it’s encouraging for all to see his determination. Like so many, I am very grateful to have a Pope like Francis in my lifetime.

Since moving back to Chicago five years ago, I have learned that despite the negative image the Catholic Church gained since news of the scandal broke in 2002, this city continues to be filled with practicing Catholics, committed to the faith.  I have been a parishioner of several Catholic churches in my lifetime - in Chicago, Kalamazoo and Atlanta - and have attended mass at churches across the country and overseas. So when moving to the southwest suburbs in 2010, we searched for a church and found St. Jude in New Lenox, a special church to be sure.  I feel very lucky to have found St. Jude where my family and I have the opportunity to listen to the best priest I have ever heard speak at mass. Father Bill Sullivan’s positive and encouraging demeanor, combined with his great knowledge of the Bible and ability to educate parishioners by providing the history and context of each reading and Gospel story, helps lift some of the mystery of our faith. He is such a great gift to all in the parish, carrying on the true Apostolic tradition and inspiring his flock.

Although Father Bill is now in his 70s and battling health issues, he remains positive and upbeat, always smiling.  I look forward to attending masses celebrated by him, knowing I will learn something new about the Gospel, Old Testament readings, Jesus, the Apostles or early Jewish customs. He always seems to provide some insight that has impact and re-energizes my faith, as if he just threw a pair of jumper cables on me and revved up God’s engine of hope, faith and love. I appreciate it because I know it helps me become a better Catholic, a better Christian, a better person. 

The parishioners of St. Jude love this Augustinian priest.  I see so many people approach Father Bill in the Narthex of St. Jude after mass, whether he is the celebrant of the mass or not. They want to say hello to him, hug him, let him know they appreciate seeing him. Why? It’s simple. They see Jesus in him and he makes them feel good. He cares about them. He tries to help them.  In this day and age when priests are so busy, with such demanding schedules, for Father Bill to be so upbeat and helpful all the time, is absolutely amazing!

One of the other aspects of St. Jude that makes it a very special church is the musical director, Tom Labanauskus, a highly talented musician and singer whose vocals pierce straight through to the soul, filling the church with the most beautiful melodies carrying words of spiritual inspiration.  Tom performs at most of the masses, but also directs the church choir, which is absolutely heaven-sent.

To share the experience of attending St. Jude, I knew words wouldn’t suffice, so I created this video. Hopefully for those Catholics who have left the Church or non-Catholics who have been considering joining, this will help them take that first step into the pews.
