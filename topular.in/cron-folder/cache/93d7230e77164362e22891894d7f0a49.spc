    <p>We do understand. There are so many things to consider when you are facing divorce, it can be easy to lose a few details in the process. At a time when emotions are running high and you might feel like you are in fight or flight mode for weeks or months, you might be struggling to get your plans together for tomorrow. It's really not the right time to worry about things too far in the future, right?</p> <p>Actually, it's a time when you must worry about things in the future. From child custody or support payments to property division, couples going through divorce have to make decisions now that will impact their lives for years. While you can certainly revisit issues through legal channels at later dates, building the best possible foundation for legal, financial and other issues now helps reduce the chance that you will deal with this stress and emotional upheaval again in the future.</p>
    <p>By taking time to plan appropriately now, you can also reduce the chance that your children or other beneficiaries might deal with such issues in the future. Wills and other estate plans are often overlooked during the divorce process, but they can be important tools that not only protect you now but in the future.</p> <p>Some first steps that anyone going through a divorce should take regarding estate plans includes revising documents that might name your spouse as executor or power of attorney. Next, you might want to consider protecting minor children by setting up trusts for them; trusts can help protect assets from a former spouse while still providing for minor children if something happens to you.

    <p>Did you know that if you receive taxable income of any type during your last year of life, someone has to file an income tax return on your behalf? This income tax return is a bit different than the taxes that could be associated with your estate.</p> <p>According to the Internal Revenue Service, the manner in which an income tax return is filed for someone who has passed away is very similar to the manner in which it is filed for someone who is still living. The one big exception is that the income, credits and expenses associated with the tax return only apply to the portion of the year during which the person was living.</p>
    <p>Why is this important in <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Estate-Planning.shtml" >an estate-planning context</a>? First of all, you'll have to plan for someone to handle this task for you so that tax matters don't crop up later for heirs or your estate. In many cases, the person who administers your estate will likely handle any relevant income tax matters.</p> <p>A second reason income tax considerations are important when dealing with estate matters is that you might want to plan to ensure any taxes owed are covered by your estate or life insurance policy. This way, an heir or beneficiary doesn't end up stuck with a bill for your income taxes.</p> <p>The final income tax return is filed on the same forms most other people use to file income tax returns. In many cases, that is the 1040 form. However, if a person's income and situation allows, the estate executor or other designee might be able to file the 1040EZ. Leaving good records for your executor can help them handle this task without excess stress or work; you can work with your legal provider to include tax decisions and needs in your estate plans.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Internal Revenue Service, "<a href="https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Deceased-Taxpayers-Filing-the-Final-Returns-of-a-Deceased-Taxpayer" target="_blank">Deceased Persons &ndash; Filing the Final Return(s) of a Deceased Person</a>," accessed Feb. 19, 2016</p>

    <p>If you have been tasked with being the guardian of another person -- whether a minor child or an adult who is disabled or incapacitated -- it's easy to become overwhelmed by feelings of responsibility. You probably feel responsible to the person you are taking care of. You might also feel responsible to the person who left you in this position if you are caring for a dependent after someone passed away.</p> <p>While striving to be the best caregiver and guardian you can be is admirable, you can't be the best for anyone else if you aren't first the best for yourself. It's important to remember to take care of yourself so you have the energy and ability to take care of others. Here are some tips for taking care of yourself if you're in a caregiver role.</p>
    <p>First, make sure you schedule time to take care of your own needs, whether that's a nice long shower or a bit of quiet time at the end of each day. Share your feelings with someone -- even if those feelings happen to be frustration, fear or stress at the situation. It helps to have someone who understands your position but is outside of your immediate care-giving circle -- that person can act as a sounding board and is a safe person to vent to on occasion.</p> <p>Remember to take care of your own health while you are looking after someone else's. Take time to eat well, sleep well and exercise. The healthier you are emotionally and physically, the better you can look after those in your care.</p> <p>If you are having legal issues with your guardianship situation, <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Conservatorships.shtml" >don't be afraid to seek help</a> from a professional. An attorney can help you resolve issues related to estates or financial situations so you can continue to care for your loved one.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> National Caregivers Library, "<a href="http://www.caregiverslibrary.org/caregivers-resources/grp-caring-for-yourself/care-for-the-caregiver-article.aspx" target="_blank">Care for the Caregiver</a>," accessed Feb. 12, 2016</p>

    <p>We know: Estate planning is not at the top of your to-do list for the day. It's probably not something you really want to talk about, but you could be using some common excuses to avoid a very necessary step in securing your own future and the future of your heirs.</p> <p>A first excuse many people use to avoid estate planning is believing they aren't going to die. Granted, the vast majority of adults don't actually believe they are immortal. However, many people subconsciously put off estate planning, thinking that it is unlikely they will pass away tomorrow. While statistics are probably in agreement, life itself is unpredictable. Putting off estate planning can -- and does -- result in leaving heirs behind to deal with unanswered questions and lengthy probate.</p>
    <p>Another reason people avoid estate planning is because time just gets away from them. You're busy, and you simply don't have time for estate planning today, this week, this month or even this year. One year becomes five, and you still might not have found time for a will. Because a will and other estate planning documents can be valuable at any time in your life -- for yourself as well as your beneficiaries -- it's important to carve out time now.</p> <p>Finally, it's common to avoid estate planning because it is just not a pleasant scenario to consider. Working with a professional, who can help you answer difficult questions and <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Estate-Planning.shtml" >create estate documents efficiently</a>, can take some of the negative association out of the process. While it's certainly not a "fun" endeavor, estate planning is a very necessary activity for just about any person.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Kiplinger, "<a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/article/retirement/T021-C000-S002-8-smart-estate-planning-steps-to-die-the-right-way.html" target="_blank">8 Smart Estate Planning Steps to Die the Right Way</a>," accessed Feb. 05, 2016</p>

    <p>A power of attorney relationship can be terminated in a number of ways. The manner in which termination occurs depends on the legal jurisdiction, how the power of attorney was created and whether the document was registered with the court.</p> <p>If you create a power of attorney, document and change your mind before registering it, you can simply destroy the document. You might also follow a procedure for termination that was laid out in the document itself. In some cases, you can revoke the POA by creating a second written document that is both signed and notarized; the document might also have to be delivered by certified means such as registered mail.</p>
    <p>If your POA documents are already registered or on file with local courts or other entities, revoking the POA could require filing or registering a second document with the court or registry. If the designated POA was a spouse, then, in some cases, a divorce might revoke the designation. In such cases, it's probably a good idea to ensure all legal paperwork is filed to ensure revocation.</p> <p>In any situation, if the principal -- the person naming the POA -- in the power of attorney passes away, the power of attorney is generally considered revoked. This is also true if the person named as the attorney-in-fact dies unless the POA document included a process for transferring POA powers to another individual in such an instance.</p> <p>Understanding how POA powers can be revoked is important, because you might change your mind about the relationship at some point after creating the documents.

    <p>When leaving behind a large fortune or valuable business assets, creating as iron-clad estate documents as possible can help ensure your wishes are followed. It can also reduce the stress and disputes that might arise between heirs. The girlfriend of a wealthy businessman is currently in a battle over millions of dollars after she claims that a business partner, who was also an heir, did not follow estate wishes with regard to funds.</p> <p>The dispute arose over the estate of the man who launched the L'eggs brand pantyhose. According to reports, he left behind a fortune worth $86 million when he died. He left control of his assets and his business to his business partner and his girlfriend.</p>
    <p>Now, the girlfriend is claiming that the business partner misappropriated some $4 million in funds from the estate. She claims that the business partner breached his duties as a fiduciary by taking those funds, which she claims were meant to go to charity. The business partner, on the other hand, said that the money was owed to him.</p> <p>The business partner claims that he had a stake totaling 20 percent in one of the deceased's real-estate ventures. He claimed the money was associated with that venture.</p> <p>After your death, details such as owed money and promises and agreements made can become confusing. Documenting everything -- and protecting your wishes with estate vehicles such as trusts -- can help <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Wills-and-Trusts.shtml" >ensure your assets are handled as you desire</a>. It can also reduce the struggles heirs go through to protect your wishes; if issues do arise, clear documentation makes dealing with them faster and easier.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> New York Post, "<a href="http://nypost.com/2016/01/22/leggs-heirs-in-4m-battle-over-panty-hose/" target="_blank">L&rsquo;eggs heirs in $4M battle over panty hose</a>," Julia Marsh, Jan. 22, 2016</p>

    <p>When working to create wills and other estate documents, one worry individuals sometimes have is that leaving a large sum of money to children could reduce the ambition those heirs have in later life. If you know you're going to inherit enough to live comfortably -- or even just pay off the mortgage -- there's a worry that you won't work as hard throughout your life. One way to mitigate such worry is to integrate <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Wills-and-Trusts.shtml" >various estate planning tools</a>, including wills, into your plans for your wealth now and later.</p> <p>First, you might not distribute all of your wealth with a simple will. Many people create what is called an incentive trust to distribute large sums of money to heirs over time. An incentive trust matches a person's income; if an heir makes $50,000 a year, then $50,000 is disbursed from the trust. You can also create a trust that ties disbursement to ages, providing smaller sums of money to heirs throughout life.</p>
    <p>Some estate plans begin now, though. You can gift small increments of money -- up to $14,000 per year without paying taxes -- to each heir. By doing so now, you can see how your heir will handle an influx of cash and have an opportunity to provide mentorship and guidance where appropriate. Some people choose to gift a in noncash ways, instead paying off debt for their heirs to create better financial futures.</p> <p>Finally, if you have a sizable amount of wealth now, you might consider involving your children in charity and foundation work. Letting your kids become responsible for money to be provided to others gives them an incentive to work hard, even if they don't have to do so for themselves.</p> <p>Each estate is unique, and each family requires a different set of tools and decisions.

    <p>'Tis the season to tally the numbers and file the tax returns, but after you finish with last year's returns, it might be time for tax considerations that impact the years to come. Many people understand the need for a will or other estate document, but they don't realize the importance of planning ahead with regard to tax requirements.</p> <p>Taxes actually play a significant role in estate planning, but not always for the reason you might think. Federal estate taxes don't kick in until your estate is worth over $5 million collectively, and there are some ways you can manage assets in your estate to make them exempt from that total. Appropriate management of the majority of estates keep federal estate taxes at bay.</p>
    <p>The same is true of many states, and some states have no estate tax at all. Understanding your estate situation, including your current and past locations might impact plans and documents, can help you avoid as many estate taxes as possible without skirting the law.</p> <p>So-called death taxes aren't the only thing you have to protect against when dealing with estate matters. Depending on how you want to manage, maintain, and use your wealth during your lifetime, you might face additional tax burdens for early withdrawals from retirement plans or gifting substantial amounts to friends or relatives. Even after you are gone, you can <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Estate-Tax-Planning.shtml" >protect your heirs from some tax issues</a> by setting up appropriate trusts and other legal vehicles to house assets and disburse them appropriately to heirs. Trusts don't automatically mean you or your heirs never pay taxes on an asset, though, and legal knowledge about selecting the right trust and implementing it properly is required to gain the best benefits.</p>

    <p>Estate planning can be a complex endeavor, and there are plenty of ways you can make mistakes that will be costly for you or your heirs in the future. Working with someone <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Estate-Planning.shtml" >experienced in estate matters</a> helps you avoid common mistakes. A lawyer can often point out some things you overlook when planning and they know about laws and requirements that aren't common knowledge. Here's a look at three of the most common mistakes in estate planning.</p> <p>A first mistake many people make is believing that their will document governs all of their estate with an iron fist. The truth is, even a well-written will doesn't trump all other documents related to your estate. Specifically, any account with a transfer-on-death or payable-on-death provision will be handled outside of your will. Such accounts include insurance policies, IRAs and 401(k) plans, and even some bank accounts. The funds from these accounts will be distributed to the person you list on the account, no matter what you put in your will. It's a good idea to review these designations to ensure they line up with your will.</p>
    <p>A next mistake people make is creating the likelihood for sibling rivalry or family disputes when they make estate plans. Unless you have a very good reason for it, you might want to pause to seriously consider writing one child out of your will or leaving a large asset to a single individual. If you are planning to divide your assets unevenly -- perhaps, for example, leaving a home to the child who cared for you in old age -- then talking to family members ahead of time can reduce shock and the chance of drawn-out probate litigation.</p> <p>Finally, not having a will at all is a very common estate planning error. Some people believe they don't have enough assets for a will, but estate planning is about more than distributing your assets. Other times, people believe they are too young for a will. The truth is, however, that a will might be needed at any time and no one knows what time that might be in their life.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Consumer Reports, "<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/04/6-costly-estate-planning-minefields-and-how-to-avoid-them/index.htm" target="_blank">6 costly estate-planning minefields, and how to avoid them</a>," accessed Dec. 31, 2015</p>

    <p>Estates can be comprised of all types of assets, including houses, cars, jewelry, investment accounts, life insurance and checking accounts. For some families, though, the creative assets of an estate far outweigh the value of real property assets. Families of musicians, writers, artists and even inventors benefit for years from income associated with creative, patented or trademarked worked. While extra money is beneficial to those heirs, the <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Estate-Planning.shtml" >estate planning and administration needs</a> of such families can be complex.</p> <p>If you have any type of creative asset -- big or small -- its important to protect those assets in your will, trusts and other estate documents. You should pass on rights to those assets and associated income and royalties just as you would any other item of value. Understanding how to use the law to protect your creative works helps solidify your future and that of your family.</p>
    <p>But it's not always as easy as it sounds. Many estates containing creative works end up in court at some point, with heirs often attempting to protect their rights to a certain work. One recent case involves the heirs of classic comedy team Abbott and Costello. The heirs claim that a Broadway play is illegally using material from the comedian's famous "Who's on First?" routine.</p> <p>In this particular case, the court decided against the heirs, saying that the play, "Hand to God" made enough changes to the original material that it was not in violation of copyright laws. While the heirs lost this battle, the Abbott and Costello body of work is large, and they have to work to protect copyrights on all those works and ensure royalties are correctly paid where appropriate.</p> <p>Working with a legal professional to set up estate documents lets you correctly pass creative rights to your children or heirs. They can continue working with professionals to protect those rights in the future.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> The New York Times, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/nyregion/heirs-of-abbott-and-costello-lose-copyright-claim-over-whos-on-first.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Heirs of Abbott and Costello Lose Copyright Claim Over &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s on First&rsquo;</a>," Dec. 17, 2015</p>

    <p>If you decide to take on the responsibility of a guardianship or conservatorship after someone asks if he or she can include you in his or her estate plans, it's a good idea to be familiar with the basic responsibilities you'll have under the law. While each situation is different, and you will be governed in part by the language in a person's estate documents, fiduciaries who are <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Conservatorships.shtml" >handling money for someone else</a> also usually have four basic legal responsibilities.</p> <p>First, you have to act in the best interest of the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the estate paperwork. That means reading the estate documents and court orders and acting on those documents. It also means avoiding conflicts between your interests and those of the estate or beneficiary and including the beneficiary whenever feasible in discussions about monetary decisions. This isn't always possible; for example, you might be the guardian for someone who is incapacitated or is a very young minor.</p>
    <p>Next, you are required to manage property and money carefully. Unless otherwise directed by the estate documents, you'll likely want to avoid risky decisions. You'll also need to work via a plan to protect assets and use them according to estate wishes and the needs of beneficiaries.</p> <p>Third, a fiduciary should never mix the property of a beneficiary or estate with his or her own property. Keeping assets separate makes it much easier to maintain organization and also avoids gray area that could land you in legal trouble.</p> <p>Finally, you should keep organized records of everything. In some cases, you might be required to report these records to the court or others responsible for aspects of the estate. Even if reporting isn't required, records help ensure you are covered if anyone ever questions your work with the estate. If you have questions about your responsibilities, seek professional legal advice before moving forward with actions you are sure of.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "<a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201310_cfpb_lay_fiduciary_guides_guardians.pdf" target="_blank">Help for court-appointed guardians of property and conservators</a>," accessed Dec. 16, 2015</p>

    <p>Did you know that a will doesn't necessarily provide for continuity of services and decisions related to critical health care and financial matters? Obviously, that's not a concern after you are gone, but estate planning actually addresses stability and security for yourself in later years as well as distribution of assets to your heirs. One estate planning tool you can use to help protect yourself and your assets is a power of attorney.</p> <p>Some reasons you might want to include a power of attorney in your estate planning are to ensure someone can make medical decisions on your behalf, appoint someone to handle critical financial issues and ensure someone you trust has access to certain types of information so he or she can make such decisions.</p>
    <p>Various types of power of attorney documents exist, and each serves a specific purpose. You can create a power of attorney that only lets someone access your information or make certain decisions if specific criteria are met. For example, if you become medically incapacitated, such as being in a coma, then a power of attorney might kick in.</p> <p>You can limit the power of the person you designate; you might give someone the power to make a choice about medical life support if you are unable to make that decision for yourself. You might also create a power of attorney form that states a certain person will have access and control over your bank account should you ever be able to handle your finances for yourself.</p> <p>Wording <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Durable-Powers-of-Attorney.shtml" >power of attorney documents</a> in a way that protects your rights and ability to make decisions as long as you can is important. Choosing the right person as a power of attorney is also critical. Our firm understands how to craft power of attorney forms that create stability for you without signing away valuable rights.</p>

    <p>We talk a lot about the value of estate planning no matter what your financial situation is, but did you know that you can combine estate and investment planning to increase the likelihood of financial success in the future? A careful approach to investments helps you build wealth that can be used by yourself and your heirs, and estate planning helps you protect and nurture that wealth.</p> <p>According to Forbes, you can make mistakes in investing that can impact your wealth generation. Being too conservative with your investments can actually negatively impact financial growth, for example, and relying too heavily on a single investment increases your risk. The same applies to estate planning: if you're too conservative in how you believe you'll spend money in the future, your estate plans might not work out as you desire. If you rely on a single legal document, such as a will, to protect your assets and wishes, you can increase the risks of probate issues or misunderstandings.</p>
    <p>Forbes also cautions investors about taking a hindsight approach or attempting to play only to current trends in the market. Growing wealth for your own use in later years or to leave to your heirs is a long-term proposition. The same is true for estate planning. You have to plan for your situation today, but you also have to understand that your situation will change over time. Working with a professional who understands <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Wills-and-Trusts.shtml" >how to create trusts</a> and other estate vehicles with future changes in mind is important.</p> <p>Estate planning, like investing, is about securing your future and the future of your heirs. In both instances, there's never a better time to start planning than right now.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Forbes, "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2015/01/23/5-common-investment-mistakes-you-dont-want-to-make/" target="_blank">5 Common Investment Mistakes You Don&#039;t Want to Make</a>," Erik Carter, accessed Dec. 03, 2015</p>

    <p>One of the reasons to plan your estate and let estate administration tools function as designed is so you are more likely to get your way when it comes to how your assets are distributed and handled. While various states do have some requirements about how you treat children and spouses in your will or estate, solid estate planning helps you avoid court decisions that might distribute your assets to people or in a manner against your wishes.</p> <p>In another country, a woman took a more dramatic approach to ensuring her wishes were adhered to. The woman, who was a grandmother at the time of her death, attempted to physically destroy her wealth to prevent heirs from gaining from it. Reportedly, the woman shredded as much as just over a million dollars worth of her country's currency. Shredded money was found on her bed, which was in a nursing home at the time. The destroyed money was found right before the woman passed away.</p>
    <p>According to reports, the woman also attempted to block heirs from gaining access to banking accounts. She cut up books related to her savings account.</p> <p>The government of her country has said the heirs don't necessarily have to take the loss. The government will provide new currency to make up for the loss if the heirs can present the shredded money as proof. And of course, the destruction of banking books doesn't permanently deny access to an account.</p> <p>Instead of taking matters into your own hands as this grandmother did, <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Estate-Planning.shtml" >working with a legal professional</a> to draft solid estate planning documents can help you protect your wishes. And while estate planning can cause you to face unpleasant decisions, it's not nearly as tedious as shredding a million dollars.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Forbes, "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2015/11/07/austrian-woman-destroys-million-dollar-fortune-rather-than-pay-out-heirs/" target="_blank">Austrian Woman Destroys Million Dollar Fortune Rather Than Pay Out Heirs</a>," Kelly Phillips, Nov. 07, 2015</p>

    <p>If you asked residents of Los Angeles if they needed a will or other form of estate planning, most would probably say they do. But it's easy to put off a will, because most people don't think they need one today. This sentiment is especially true for those in their younger years; a will might be important, but you feel like there is plenty of time to get around to such planning.</p> <p>The ugly truth is that there might be time and there might not be time. Life doesn't always go according to plan, and tragedies and terrible events do occur. For individuals who act upon the knowledge that they need a will today, terrible events don't leave family or heirs caught up in probate or without means of support.</p>
    <p>One reason you really need a will now is to ensure your wishes are recorded should something happen to you. A will can record wishes for how you want your assets distributed after your death, but it can also record wishes for your end-of-life care.</p> <p>Another reason you need a will is to help protect your heirs -- especially those that might be minors or dependents. A will can layout how assets are distributed to heirs and detail your wishes for who cares for minor heirs. For even stronger protection, you might consider additional estate vehicles such as trusts.</p> <p>A third reason to <a href="http://www.jacilaw.com/Services/Wills-and-Trusts.shtml" >handle the estate planning process</a> and create a will sooner rather than later is that it provides you with peace of mind.
