O.K., let's be honest, Friday afternoon's game between the Cubs and Cards truly was nothing like that. It was played under steel-grey skies on a raw, windy day that felt much more like March than May. The Cubs, with most of their vaunted hopes for the future still working out the kinks in the minor leagues, finished April in last place in the National League Central with a record of 9 wins and 17 losses.

The Cards, though they've stumbled to a .500 start over the first month, won the NL pennant two of the past three years and are much more likely again to contend for the playoffs than the Cubs.

Yet, the Cubs, for at least a day, got the better of the vaunted St. Louis team, winning an entertaining game by a 6-5 score, and punishing Cardinals' pitching ace Adam Wainwright for six runs on 10 hits in just five innings.

Not that the game wasn't an adventure. The Cubs took a 6-3 lead into the top of the eighth, and brought in reliever Justin Grimm, who had been throwing well. Today, he didn't, giving up a walk, a two-run homer and a single, getting his only out on a long fly to the wall that centerfielder Ryan Sweeney managed to catch even though he injured himself chasing it down (with what looked to be a pulled hamstring muscle). Fortunately, Ryan Schlitter, who relieved Grimm, snuffed the Cardinals' rally and preserved the Cubs' chance to win.

Nonetheless, what Cubs' fans have to look for in what's developing as yet another rebuilding season are the players who will be the building blocks of a future winner -- if the bevy of minor league prospects the team keeps talking about turn out to be all that. And some of the positive signs that defy the team's now 10-17 record were on display today.

<strong>Anthony Rizzo</strong>, the young first baseman who fell short of his promise during 2013's 96-loss season, appears to have hit his stride. He hit a solo homer and a two-run single and also walked in four plate appearances Friday, and now has five homers, 15 rbi, a .295 batting average and sterling .413 on-base percentage.

<strong>Starlin Castro, </strong>the 24-year-old shortstop, went one-for-four and scored a run. Coming off a poor 2013 season like Rizzo, Castro has opened this year with four homers, 14 rbi and a .306 batting average. He still has a space-cadet problem in the field and skipped a throw past Rizzo that allowed the Cards to score an unearned run in the 4th, but his hitting has clearly improved.

<strong></strong>Catcher <strong>Wellington Castillo, </strong>more highly regarded for his defense than offense when he came up to the majors for good in 2012, is showing signs that he has hitting chops as well. Friday, he had three doubles in four at-bats with two rbi, raising his season batting average to .300.

<strong>Emilio Bonafacio</strong> is a journeyman who already has played for seven different major league teams. But he seems to have found himself in Chicago, going 2-for-4 Friday to raise his season average to . 343. His ability to play a variety of positions could make him a valuable role player if the Cubs shock the world and start winning sooner rather than later: He shifted from second base to centerfield after Sweeney came up limping in the 8th inning.

Winning pitcher <strong>Travis Wood </strong>is following up well on his solid first season with the Cubs last year. He went seven innings Friday and gave up two earned runs, six hits and no walks while striking out six. His season record now is 2 wins and 3 losses with a 3.35 ERA.

And <strong>Hector Rondon</strong> earned his second save by shutting the Cards down with a one-two-three 9th. Rondon was an April bright spot with his strong set-up relief, and he has been given a shot at closer after Jose Veras and Pedro Strop stumbled in that role. Friday's performance certainly earned him another shot at keeping the job. In 13 appearances this season, Rondon has an ERA of 0.63, he's allowing less than one baserunner per inning and is averaging more than one strikeout per inning.

Lest I be accused of being driven mad by my rose-colored glasses, that 10-17 record says the Cubs have a long way to go before they will be able to satisfy their fans' increasingly urgent demands for a winner. The lineup still has way too many born pinch-hitters playing starting roles. You still never know what you're going to get from the middle relief corps.

But what's also true is that there finally appears to be a cadre of promising players at the Friendly Confines of Wrigley who make it worth coming out to catch a game. It's a bit of a small favor for now, but it's more than fans have had to hang their Cubs hats on for a long time.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Bob Benenson";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4880:"There is nothing like a beautiful, balmy day in early May, with the contending Chicago Cubs playing the archrival St. Louis Cardinals in a key early-season matchup at Wrigley.

If there are any other cities in which you can walk up the main commercial avenue, take a tunnel a few hundred feet under a roadway, and be on a swimming beach, I've never been there.

Chili fans out there know there are lively debates about which state makes the best chili and which ingredients make that chili recipe “real.” For example, “real” Texas chili is supposed to be made with cubed beef, rather than ground beef, and it is supposed to be made with no beans.

But there are some of us who like to make the steak version of chili now and then, but also like beans. Fortunately, the author of my current crockpot bible — <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slow-Cooker-Cookbook-Easy-Make/dp/0811866572">Slow Cooker: The Best Cookbook Ever</a> — is of the same mind.

And easy, of course. Here’s all there is to the recipe:

[Note to Spice Girls (and Guys) out there: This is a pretty mild chili recipe. If it ain't chili for you if you're not breathing fire after eating it, take the chili powder up a few notches. But don't get carried away -- if it's not spicy enough, you can always adjust the seasoning upwards toward the end of the cooking cycle.]

* Cut 2-1/2 pounds of beef into one-half inch cubes. The recipe (not surprisingly, given the name of the dish) calls for sirloin, but I used a mix of chuck stew beef and steak tips and it worked well.

* Salt the meat evenly (about 2 teaspoons) and add a light sprinkling of cayenne if you like. Then add olive oil to a pan (or pans), heat to medium-high, then brown the meat in batches on the stovetop, making sure not to overcrowd the pan (or the meat won’t brown well).

* When the meat is sufficiently browned, remove to the slow cooker. Then, using the same pan(s), add 2 large, coarsely chopped sweet onions, 2 cloves minced garlic and a chopped jalapeno with a couple of teaspoons of chili powder and a half-teaspoon each of cumin powder and dried oregano (adding more olive oil if the pan is too dry). Reduce heat to medium-low and saute until the veggies are softened, about 5 minutes, stirring often. [Note about the jalapeno: If you want really spicy, leave the seeds in; if you want milder, leave them out.]

* Add 1/4 cup cornmeal when the vegetables are about done and stir for about 1 minute, then stir in 2 cups of beef broth and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and add to the meat in the slow cooker.

* Almost done. You just have to add 12 ounces of beer (they recommend Lone Star for authenticity — I used a dark beer bottled under the Trader Joe’s label), which adds flavor and helps tenderize the meat; one 15 oz. can of tomato puree; and two 15 oz. cans of black beans (drained and rinsed) to the slow cooker. Stir it all together, and set it on high for 4-5 hours or low for 8-10 hours. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary.

I’ll try a ground meat version soon and share it if I like it. If you’ve got a great crockpot chili recipe or a stovetop version that can be easily converted, let me know.

Just a couple of days earlier, the Chicago Blackhawks' hockey season -- delayed from its scheduled October start by a contract dispute between National Hockey League owners and players -- finally got under way.

To most people, there won't be an obvious connection between these two events. But Obama and the Blackhawks are connected in a very significant way for me. On March 11, 2011, I had the pleasure of going to the White House to attend the ceremony in which the president (and first lady Michelle Obama) honored the team for its NHL championship the season before.

The event was one of the last before I ended a 30-year career covering politics in Washington, D.C., for Congressional Quarterly and lit out for Chicago, where I've spent the past year and a half working to build a new journalism career around my passion for food and drink.

And as a lifelong sports and politics junkie, my afternoon with the president, the Blackhawks and the Stanley Cup ranks among my favorite events. Ever.

Here's how this came about. My wife, who grew up in the Chicago area, and I began in December 2010 to mull relocating to the city (which I'd regarded for many years as my second hometown). I started networking almost immediately, and through some connections in the political community here, I learned that there was going to be a lawyers vs. celebrities charity hockey game just after Christmas in which the lineup included Mike Quigley, a Democratic congressman from Chicago's North Side.

I attended the game, and got to meet Quigley. Then, when I found out he was playing in a congressional charity hockey game, this time at D.C.'s Verizon Center in March 2011, I arranged an interview and wrote a preview story for one of my company's publications. And as a result of that, I was able to get credentialed for the Blackhawks event at the White House.

The event, on the South Lawn of the White House, featured the president speaking about the Blackhawks' triumph with the team standing behind him and the Stanley Cup on display to his left. The team presented him with a jersey bearing his name and the number 44 -- Obama is the 44th president of the United States -- and a miniature replica of the Cup. Michelle Obama also took a turn at the podium to promote the Let's Move childhood fitness and anti-obesity program that she developed.

It's a little short of two years later. The Blackhawks have quickly raised their fans' hopes that this short season could be a special one by winning their first two games on the road at Los Angeles and Phoenix. Should they win the championship this year, or in either of the next two seasons, they'll again be greeted at the White House by President Obama.

As for me, I am now living in the Lakeview section of Chicago, in the 5th Congressional District represented by ... Mike Quigley. And congressman, please be alerted that if there ever is another Blackhawks ceremony at White House, I'll be contacting you to ask if you can again assist me in getting credentialed.

Last time, when your staff was able to get me in, it was because I was a D.C. political reporter covering a congressman's passion for hockey.

The apartment, which looks directly down into Belmont Harbor, has a bit of a unique design that enables us to see clear across Lake Michigan to the east and down to its southern end, across the downtown skyline and out to the suburbs on the western horizon. As such, for much of the year, we get to watch the sun rising over the lake in the morning and setting each evening in the west.

I realized from the get-go that most people don't get to enjoy these sights on a regular basis, and have tried to share the experience as often as possible by posting photographs. Most of the time these just go up on Facebook. But I thought the colors were so striking at sunset tonight -- a light haze turning the sun into a bright red disk and the sky into a technicolor palette -- that it just seemed right to share it on the blog.
