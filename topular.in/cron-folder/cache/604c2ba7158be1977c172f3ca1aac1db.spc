<em>811 Mass. Ave. • 317.624.1010 • artbankgallery.com</em><br />
The Art Bank featured artist, fine oil artist Parrish Cooper will unveil a new, large-scale portrait, as part of the debut of her show, “Echoes of Change,” March 6th. The unveiling will take place at 7:30 pm.<br />
Working in oils and focusing on human portraits (with the occasional animal portrait or abstract), Cooper has also begun hosting artist critiques at the Art Bank. “What I most enjoy is having the opportunity to be of help to other artists,” said Cooper. “When I was a student at Herron School of Art &amp; Design, I could see that the critiques that we participated in on a regular basis were of great help to all of the art students. When artists ‘complete’ an artwork, they are often temporarily blind to what might improve the work, but seeing it through the eyes of other artists is extremely helpful in becoming a better artist.” Cooper’s next critique will be March 18th, at the Art Bank. Space is limited, and Cooper asks that interested artists contact her directly, at (317) 771-8763.</p>
<p><strong>Gallery 924</strong><br />
<em>924 N. Pennsylvania St. • 317.631.3301 • indyarts.org/gallery924</em><br />
Jonathan McAfee: Classical Waste. McAfee is known for his colorful, gestural portraits of cultural icons including everyone from Indianapolis legend Kurt Vonnegut to rap icon Biggie Smalls. His interest in the development of portraiture through the centuries drives his desire to examine this topic further. His current work explores a new interest relating to cultural icons, but it is one of mass production and mass appeal. All of the subjects for this show are taken from clothing giant American Apparel ads and models &#8211; they are sexy and seductive, young, playful, and oftentimes ridiculous. American Apparel models are not your typical strong men with bulging muscles and brooding eyes or women that fit a specific supermodel vision. Rather, they are disheveled and emotionless; beautiful and real.<br />
McAfee examines this shift in cultural norms that present themselves in portraiture &#8211; whether they are from an official royal portrait from the Renaissance or a 21st century anti-heroic jeans ad. As a student of historic portraits, the artist wishes to consider what defines contemporary perceptions of masculinity and femininity today versus what it looked like in centuries past.</p>

<strong>Gallery No. 2:</strong> Bryan Tisdale, Drawn Inward. Of this work, Tisdale says, “Through layering symmetrical patterns I express simultaneous chaos and balance that I often feel in my everyday life. Patterns and forms, that by themselves may express a singular emotion, are layered to create a complex visual representation of feelings that I have at the time of creation. I use color to represent emotions that I might openly share with others, while gray tones represent emotions are shared with few or only shared through this visual medium.”<br />

Meet &amp; Greet local artist, Gabe Von Art. Gabe enjoys creating and selling intricate pieces of art and jewelry. His recent work is about the Star Maker who lives a life of solitude and every day adds to his vivid painting which is the night sky. Each piece of art is based on a sentence from a children’s which Von Art is currently writing about this mysterious painter. Gabe’s artistic ability to tell a narrative through his work has increased from his quest to create and understand the Star Maker as a character, man, and as an artist. One of the more prominent pieces in this particular show is titled “The Star Maker’s Desk”. This desk is where Pallitino Massari (The Star Maker) goes to think. His ideas are represented on the table top. Von Art likes to draw on desks so this piece was a good fit for him. He asks that you enjoy life and hope you enjoy his work.</p>

The Indiana Landmarks Center will feature acrylic paintings on collage by artist, Robert Allan James, “The Articles of Loss”. “My work is a reflection of decay and loss,” said James. “I was struck recently by images of children in London during the Blitz, trying to play but forced to wear gasmasks. In this era of Ebola, what more symbolic image is there of a child? Drawn with cartoon whimsy, is the child with a gasmask any less troubling, a reminder of that time when we realized that the world was deadly earnest and not a playground? A robot can look comical, but it is still a machine that has rigid tasks and a set routine, one that keeps working until it wears out or is obsolete. A house doesn’t become obsolete, but it can be abandoned by those who once held it as the symbol of a new life and future.<br />
Using a collage of scraps from everyday life as canvas, I paint images that try to reflect the spiritual adversities we endure. This happens to each of us, and how we adapt to these events informs who we are. I am fascinated by what gets left behind in the wake of loss.”<br />
Robert Allan James grew up in Logansport, IN and studied Fine Art at the University of Saint Francis from 1991-1995 and has lived and worked in Indianapolis since 1997. Under his artist name Robaljam, he has participated in Oranje, Indy Visual Fringe, Tonic Ball Tonic Gallery, and several RAW Artists showcases.</p>

<p>Born in China, Di Sun earned a Bachelor of Arts in Radio and Television Directing from Qingdao Agricultural University and currently is a candidate for a Master of Fine Arts in Photography and Intermedia from Herron of School of Art and Design.  As a photographer, Sun constructs a scene, similar to a painter creating a scene, and explores the juxtaposition between documentary and staged photography.</p>
<p>Justin Walsh received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography from the Herron School of Art and Design where he currently is a candidate to receive his Master of Fine Arts in Photography and Intermedia.  The current photographic work of Walsh explores natural and synthetic texture fields.  Rather than focusing on a subject matter, Walsh showcases the intricate patterns of color and space allowing the viewer to value the geometric abstractions and to find meaning without the constraints of recognized objects.</p>

<p>In March, the Mural of America tour commences as project creator Arnholter engages visitors at the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D.C. Community members will complete a pair of identical 8’ x 4’ paint-by-numbers art pieces created specifically for the festival and the community. Each of the thousands of participants will sign the final works. One copy of the mural will be donated back to the community and the other will be archived. In the ensuing 18 months, the Mural of America RV will travel to all 50 States. Venues will include festivals, state fairs, rodeos, jazz concerts and the Boston Marathon.</p>
<p>Ultimately created by over 100,000 individuals, the works from all 50 states and the District of Columbia will be united and displayed on the National Mall, the weekend of July 4, 2016. The entire project will then be donated to a public venue, university, city complex or airport.</p>
<p>Potential sponsors, donors, and venues hosts for the Mural of the World tour may find contact information for the project at MuralOfTheWorld.com.</p>

<em>1505 N. Delaware St. • 317.396.3886 • harrisoncenter.org</em><br />
<strong>Harrison Gallery:</strong> Landscape Beyond, surreal and abstract landscape paintings by Benaiah Cusack. Cusack is a contemporary landscape painter in Indianapolis who emerged on the art scene in 2012.  His surreal and abstract paintings embody dramatic color, texture, mixed media elements and his unique view of nature, fantasy and the mystical.<br />
“I paint to document my inner life, impressions, and attempt to capture the fragments of beauty and melancholy from nature.  When I start a painting, I escape into another world.  I don’t usually know where the destination will take me.   The painting process is a journey that navigates me into the framework of my canvas.  Biomorphic shapes and paint splatters start the process.  Then I add layer-upon-layer of paint and texture, and eventually the piece starts to take shape.   Through my art, I want to transport the viewer into a surreal landscape where the mundane world disappears, lifting a veil and revealing a dramatic visual story.  I hope that my paintings can open a window into a new environment that creates metaphors for life or sparks the imagination: a landscape beyond.”<br />
<strong>Gallery No.</strong> 2: a collaboration between Joel Dart and Kathryn Dart bridges their respective creative worlds: the technical and the visual. Joel has written a series of poems in JavaScript, a programming language, and together they have created art to further represent the concepts in the poetry. Using the pixel as a building block, these works map out the words and symbols, giving the viewer a visual window into the technical poetry. To learn more about Joel’s poetry.js project, see the following article:  http://www.skybluewindow.org/indianapolis/poetry-20/Content?oid=2220983  For the full list of the poetry, see the entry on GitHub. https://github.com/joeldart/poetry.js<br />
<strong>City Gallery:</strong> HCA artist and elementary school art teacher, Amy Reel’s show, Colossal, features larger than life portraits. Reel says, “Unlike traditional to-scale portraiture, these works share the role of art and art-observer with those who view them. The viewer is confronted with the presence of the person and forced to see them.  The subjects were chosen because they are people around us. They are portraits of my community: The Oaks Academy. Relatives, friends, colleagues, and students are familiar and usually comfortable, until they are staring back larger than life size.”<br />
<strong>Hank &amp; Dolly’s Gallery:</strong> PhotoVoice Project. Over the last 10-15 years, there has been a large influx of Burmese refugees in the United States. &#8220;During this time, over 10,000 Burmese refugees have been resettled or secondarily moved to Indianapolis, with an estimated 40% of those being children.  Because of their ability to quickly learn English and understand Western systems and customs, Burmese adolescents are often the liaisons between their families and the greater Indianapolis community. This Photovoice Project gives us an opportunity to glimpse into their lives. By giving the adolescents cameras and discussing the photos they capture, we have a better understanding of their role in the Burmese community, and in particular, the barrier faced by the Burmese in regards to health and medical care.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Gallery Annex:</strong> Chad Campbell, Hector Del Campo and Kandi Jamieson will be on display in the Gallery Annex.<br />

<em>1043 Virginia Ave. • Murphy Arts Center, Suite 217 • 317.721.2787 • primarycolours.org</em><br />
Primary Gallery presents Kristen Morsches, Di Sun, and Justin Walsh in the gallery’s student show. The three artists featured in the exhibit are currently earning their Master of Fine Arts from the Herron School of Art and Design. As an organization that strives to assist local artists in the Indianapolis community, Primary Gallery is proud to support the emerging artists and provide a professional learning experience as they graduate into the local art scene.<br />
The artwork of Morsches is informed by the organic forms in nature.  Through her art, Morsches looks to create organization and order from the chaos and unpredictability found in nature.<br />
Born in China, Di Sun constructs a scene, similar to a painter creating a scene, and explores the juxtaposition between documentary and staged photography.<br />
The current photographic work of Justin Walsh explores natural and synthetic texture fields.  Rather than focusing on a subject matter, Walsh showcases the intricate patterns of color and space allowing the viewer to value the geometric abstractions and to find meaning without the constraints of recognized objects.<br />

“Signs Hidden in Plain Sight” by Carl Pope is an exhibition of letterpress broadsides produced since 2004 to be displayed at Indy Reads Books from January &#8211; February 2015. Posters as referential signs hold a wealth of meaning and insight when interfacing with a reader’s previous reading. Reading signs is nothing new for the deaf, but it is a fairly recent development in visual culture in the Information Age. The quotes selected for the broadsides originate from various people across many fields of endeavor but represent a constellation of themes addressing Blackness, the unknown, the subconscious, and community. I wish to promote the positive potential of literacy through this form of reading/viewing/reflecting by collaborating with Indy Reads in this fundraising exhibition.</p>

<p>Influenced equally by the history of painting as by the pulp imagery of pop-culture, Hancock transforms traditionally formal decisions—such as the use of color, language and pattern—into opportunities to build narrative, develop sub-plots and convey symbolic meaning. Hancock’s works are suffused with personal mythology presented at an operatic scale, often reinterpreting Biblical stories that the artist learned as a child from his family and local church community. His exuberant and subversive narratives employ a variety of cultural tropes, ranging in tone from comic-strip superhero battles to medieval morality plays and influenced in style by Hieronymus Bosch, Max Ernst, Henry Darger, Philip Guston and R. Crumb. Text embedded within the paintings and drawings both drives the narrative and acts as a central visual component.</p>
<p>As a whole, Hancock’s highly developed cast of characters acts out a complex mythological battle, creating an elaborate cosmology that embodies his unique aesthetic ideals, musings on color, language, emotions and ultimately, good versus evil. Hancock’s mythology has been translated to the stage in an original ballet, Cult of Color: Call to Color, commissioned by Ballet Austin and created by Trenton Doyle Hancock, choreographer Stephen Mills and composer Graham Reynolds. The ballet performances debuted in Austin in April 2008. He created an original mural for the new Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Dallas, TX, as well as a site-specific installation entitled, A Better Promise, at the Seattle Art Museum’s Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, WA.</p>
<p>Trenton Doyle Hancock was born in 1974 in Oklahoma City, OK. Raised in Paris, Texas, Hancock earned his BFA from Texas A&amp;M University, Commerce and his MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, Philadelphia. Hancock was featured in the 2000 and 2002 Whitney Biennial exhibitions, becoming one of the youngest artists in history to participate in this prestigious survey. His work has been the subject of one-person exhibitions at The Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston; The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, TX; The Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami; Institute for Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; The University of South Florida Contemporary Art Museum, Tampa; The Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah and Atlanta; The Weatherspoon Museum, Greensboro; Sheldon Museum of Art, Lincoln; Canzani Center Gallery, The Columbus School of Art and Design, OH; Olympic Sculpture Park at the Seattle Art Museum, WA; The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh; and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Hancock’s work is in the permanent collections of several prestigious museums, including the Brooklyn Museum, NY; Baltimore Museum of Art, MD; Columbus Museum of Art, OH; The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu; The Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York; Dallas Museum of Art, TX; High Museum of Art, Atlanta; Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, Peekskill; Kemper Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, TX; Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; Museo di arte moderna e contemporanea, Trento, Italy; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museum of Modern Art, New York; New Orleans Museum of Art, LA; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, CA; Sheldon Museum of Art, Lincoln; Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton; The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; University of Texas at Austin Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art, TX; Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, VA; Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Wexner Center for the Arts at the Ohio State University, Columbus; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Wichita State University, Ulrich Museum of Art, KS.

<p>The Art Bank hosts a Bob Ross Look-Alike Contest for Second Friday Family Night, January 9th, 6-9pm. “<em><strong>Like a Ross</strong></em>” will be an all-ages event, with patrons encouraged to come dressed as the popular PBS-broadcasted artist. “It’s January, and we figured we’d need something to break up any of the winter doldrums that will be on us by that time. We love Bob Ross at the Art Bank, and wanted to do something to celebrate his legacy,” said gallery manager Joy Hernandez.</p>
<p>Many of the Art Bank Artists watched Bob Ross paint, on his show, “The Joy of Painting,” in the 80’s and 90’s, and were soothed by his calm demeanor and inspired by his work and accepting approach. Having permission to make “happy little accidents” with our work gave us the freedom to grow and experiment in our own media. “Bob Ross is a personal art hero &#8211; I am no landscape painter myself, but what Bob Ross exemplified was that every mistake made can be a strength, and that anyone can be an artist if they have the courage to just pick up a brush,” said January Featured Artist Andrew Koeling. “And, it’s the hair.”<br />
Koeling lived and worked in Muncie, Indiana, for 15 years and felt a local connection to Ross there, where the shows were taped at Ball State University. “Art isn&#8217;t meant to be perfect &#8211; it&#8217;s made with flaws and inconsistencies, just like people &#8211; and he celebrated that in each and every piece he did.”</p>
<p>Participants are invited to come dressed as Bob Ross, invoking his look, demeanor, and, of course, wearing a smile. Props are encouraged, and we’d love to even see a “happy little tree.” All ages can participate, as Ross touched the young, the old, and everyone in between, before his death in 1995. Prizes will be rewarded, admission is free. “Have I mentioned the hair?” said Koeling.</p>

<p>Andrew Koeling&#8221;s <em><strong>Acute Acts of Defiance</strong></em>, opens in the Feature Room. “I wanted to put this show together to try and progress the understanding of each viewer and attempt to inspire them to contemplate on what makes the very act of living worthwhile &#8211; we forget to let the little things in life play a larger role when life is, quite literally, one step in front of another,” said Andrew Koeling. An epoxy artist, Koeling layers ink and other materials in layers of resin, to give his work added levels of depth.</p>
<p>“When we read or watch the news, for as long as I can remember, we are constantly bombarded with images and events that cause us to perceive a world that is seemingly at odds with itself: lower standards of living, fanaticism, and a loss of identity, barraged into our lives to the point where we lose sight of the bigger picture. Everything is presented to us in short, easy to digest blurbs that repeatedly make us question what went wrong and how.</p>
<p>“This show is meant to stand in opposition to what we commonly have inserted into our lives and instead celebrates the greatness of mankind: how even when it seems darkest, we are still reaching out into the Cosmos, how even in the most destructive and dangerous places on the planet, life still thrives, and that when we finally tune out the negativity implanted into our lives, slow down, and appreciate the little things we miss, we are given a better perspective into the lives and world around us &#8211; all starting with that first acute sense of defiance,” said Koeling.</p>

The show incorporates paintings in his signature style &#8211; instantly recognizable whimsical cityscapes, farm houses and landscapes in oils, acrylics and watercolors employing bright, bold colors. But along side this work will be new, experimental work that assumes a wide range of aesthetics. Vining became a Harrison Center studio artist last year. An enthusiastic participant in the center’s artist community, he has sought constructive feedback in his pursuit to become a better and more well rounded creator. Much of the new work in this show is directly inspired and influenced by other Harrison Center artists.<br />
Vining grew up on a small family farm in Northern Indiana and frequently draws inspiration from rural America. A former elementary art teacher, Vining earned a degree in law before shifting his focus to art &#8211; pursuing his one time hobby as a full-time flourishing business.</p>

<p><strong>City Gallery:</strong> <em><strong>Ephemeral Nature</strong></em>, new work by Carolyn Springer<br />
Encaustic prints of Indiana Wildflowers by Carolyn Springer. This body of work is the result of an encaustic conference at Provincetown, MA and workshop at the Truro Center for the Arts in Castle Hill, in May of 2013 with David A. Clark. The experience exposed her to new methods of working with colored wax. The work created for this show explores encaustic printmaking and the imagery of Indiana native plants.<br />
Even before researching wildflowers for Ephemeral Nature, Carolyn felt an affinity for these fragile native flowers. Realizing the responsibility to the local ecology she planted a garden of milkweed, coneflower and other indigenous plants at the Harrison Center where her studio is located. It is Carolyn’s wish that the show and the new garden will raise awareness of the need to continue to plant these Indiana beauties.</p>

“The Best Holiday Show Ever” will be located in the Feature Room of the Art Bank, and showcase the work of many of the Art Bank’s nearly 40 artists.<br />
“The Best Holiday Show Ever” highlights the diverse backgrounds and celebrations among the Art Bank artists. Each artist will create a piece that represents what they love about whichever winter holiday they choose to celebrate. Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Solstice, Festivus, or even just the winter season itself, the Art Bank artists welcome everyone to celebrate with them. The Art Bank hosts nearly 40 artists and each brings their own experience levels, life experience, beliefs and outlook to their work and to the group as a whole. The artists wanted to celebrate the season with their work in this show, but to do it in a way that encourages everyone to smile, feel included and celebrated, working with their individual voices to bring together a strong group show, in a month when everyone is hurrying about to celebrate their own holidays with family events. Together, the Art Bank artists will pause, enjoy the company of each other and their patrons, and appreciate the friendship they have gained through their own art.<br />
The Art Bank offers an opportunity for children to take in and learn about the art world, during the Second Friday Family Night, on December 12th, again 6 to 9 pm, and admission is free.</p>

“Totems” by Laura Levine illustrate both man’s disconnect with nature and the individual’s search for meaning. At times they express hope through a maternal spirit figure and at others dismay at our increasing misuse of our planet’s resources.  Laura’s hope is to reach a balance of these two conflicting interests, and express this dichotomy to the viewer through her artwork. Exposure to the Renaissance work in Florence has had a significant impact on her work.  Her pieces are a mixture of traditional figurative and classical influences, as well as her personal contemporary mythology.  Laura has exhibited nationally and internationally.</p>

Contributing artists may donate 50% or 100% of the proceeds from the sale of his/her work. All unsold work will be returned to the artist. All proceeds donated to IDADA will support the general operating fund. IDADA uses these funds to directly serve the local Indianapolis visual arts community.<br />

&#8220;Color Coded&#8221; by Gautam Rao explorescontrasts between image and text, analog and digital methods and between analytical and aesthetic thinking. Through grid paintings, illustration and typographic experiments, this exhibit encompasses a year of play at the intersection of art and design.This body of work contrasts highly systematic thinking with a love of the quirky and whimsical. The systematic thinking is embodied in type design and meticulously illustrated alphabet posters. It’s embodied in the technological rigor of working with Bézier curves and within strictly de ned color palettes. This analytical approach contrasts with the whimsy of unexpected juxtapositions of color,<br />
interactive toys and playful drawings. The exhibit lives in the place where right and left brain thinking meet. This contrast makes for an<br />
exciting, dynamic dialogue.</p>

&#8220;Guardians&#8221; by Grace Kite a self-taught mixed media artist, born and raised in Indiana &amp; currently works from her studio in the SoBro Arts Community. She draws upon her personal history to create mixed-media that tell the rich stories of her life. Growing up in a family with both European and Asian heritages, she found herself collecting fragments of family memories, stories, and daily experiences, while finding the common thread of meaning within her own life. From this she creates visual statements: art that reflects her distinct impression of life and living.  Kite loves traveling and photographing street art, and uses her travels as inspiration.</p>

&#8220;Wanderlust&#8221;: Paul Harris will work in iMOCA’s Murphy Art Center to create a new installation that includes antique doll heads, crosses, pine needles, and 3-D collages. Harris hasn’t shown his work for nine years. His last solo show happened 13 years ago. iMOCA executive director Shauta Marsh is excited to be hosting Harris’s exhibition:  “He’s one of Indianapolis’s most important artists. Not only did he help lay the foundation for the art scene we have today. But, through his work, he offers an experience like no other.” Harris, an Indianapolis native, tends to use religious imagery in his works. In the past, some considered his work to be anti-religion which attracted protestors outside his show One Night Stand. However he explains: “Religious imagery is comforting. I don’t know that I am religious but what I like about using it in my work is that everyone brings his/her own baggage or interpretation. It invokes an immediate response.”</p>

Michael Helsley&#8217;s &#8220;Do you remember the fish? No, I remember the ice cream&#8221;. Helsely is known for his fun, whimsical, graphic characters who often float in the air or cling to a window. The artist uses recycled vinyl from billboards and other found objects to create these often larger-than-life figures. With this installation Helsley hopes to create an environment where the audience is both viewing and being viewed, turning the floor to ceiling windows of Gallery 924 into a &#8220;fish bowl&#8221; of sorts. Making use of the extensive amount of window space at the gallery, the viewer is obligated to observe the installation from both inside and outside. In essence, creating an interactive visual where patrons move in and out of the installation and become a part of the &#8220;fish bowl experience. The installation will transform the gallery space into a spectacle, a kind of living, fluid memory. Free parking for cars and bikes.</p>
