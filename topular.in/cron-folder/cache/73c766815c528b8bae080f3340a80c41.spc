Though I've always loved cooking - grown up in a home that celebrated authentic Indian cuisine and flavors - it was not until I had children that I realized cooking it at home and finding ways to get them to eat it was paramount.

As I struggled to get food on the table and maintain my day job as an early morning television reporter in Chicago, it hit me that through the ups and downs of growing up Indian-American in the 1970's and 80's outside of Philadelphia - Indian food was my rock.

Young, awkward and often confused about my own identity, I could refuse to wear Indian clothes to parties, I could be embarrassed about my parents' heavy accents in front of sales clerks, and I could feign deafness when yet another kid in my school made fun of what they deemed 'poverty-stricken' India where people all lived in 'huts'.

But, in the safety net of our home - away from the prying-judging eyes, I could revel in my preference for <em>dal chawal</em> or a spiced Indian onion salad. We ate fragrant curries instead of big macs and cumin in our spaghetti - and no one needed to know. We also ate super healthy - my  mother was militant about it. Eating fruit and veggies was the norm not an aberration.

It's why, when my girls were young and starting school, I was determined they should also be exposed to Healthy. Indian. Homemade. I knew that figuring out ways to get them to eat the food I cooked for them would help them not only become healthy eaters, but also give them something cultural to call their own - even in difficult times. Pride in your roots and culture goes a long way no matter where you grow up or how.

Right now, we are in a spot where I feel like the craziness of late last year has pushed us to give up some tried and true healthy eating habits and start ones that I'm not happy with. An example? My older one has been defaulting to drinking Gatorade during soccer and basketball games. Huge 'no' in our house - their growing bodies - in my opinion - do not need the sugar, the dyes, or the electrolytes. Their doctors agree with me. You may not and that's cool. But, that's not the point. I'm going to talk here about weaning your kids off the habits you likely know are not good healthy eating lifetime choices and instead instilling moderation and balance.

In the above example - if the girls want Gatorade it's seen as a truly once-in-awhile treat and not the daily norm. Water is what I want their default to be - easy and clean.

So, bookmark this blog and check it weekly for the tips and thoughts that will get you through your days as you set and reset your kids' eating habits. We'll agree on many things - agree to disagree on others, but the key is that you will see true and tried ways that I have gotten my kids to TRY fruits, veggies, and many other healthy food.

I'm not a nutritionist. I'm a mom. A cookbook author. And, someone who believes in keeping food simple, stupid.

Me too! What I find when I try and feed my kids is that fun and presentation matter. I found both in this easy taco bowl idea.

Purchase the pre-made edible bowls. I found mine at Whole Foods in the international aisle. I love them because they love them - more fun than just chips they tell me, and each one holds the perfect amount of food to make one meal for a 10 and 12 year old.

I stick them in the toaster oven for about 30 seconds to just warm them and then layer, layer, layer with everything your kids love to eat.

Here's what I layer in mine in this order:

Beans (either black beans or leftover Indian like Rajmah - spiced kidney beans)
chopped onion
shredded lettuce
sliced black olives
cubed avocado
chopped tomato
shredded Mexican blend cheese
you can also add sour cream, rice, quinoa, and whatever else you have in the fridge

After layering (have your kids help with it), it's back in the toaster oven for another 30 seconds so the cheese melts a bit. I finish off with a sprinkle of salt, red chile pepper or cayenne, and some salsa.

Done, done and done!

You could even put all the components into their lunch boxes separately and let them compose their own meal for lunch.

Remember, ownership is a great way to get your kids to actually try and even eat their healthy food. AND so is presentation. My kids went crazy over these little plates left over from my last cookbook shoot (you can barely see them in the picture). They are the perfect size for individual taco bowls.

I know that I am.

I'd urge you not to forget the kids when shoring up the resolve to eat better and stock up on more fruit and veggies. Think they are hopeless? Think again. Use this blog site to give you inspiration throughout the year on how to get them (and you) excited to eat healthier in 2015.

Whenever folks see my kids gobbling up salads - spinach, kale, and even beets - in restaurants, many take a second look. It's just not the norm these days. But, it is in my home because I made healthy eating a priority for me, for them, and for my husband (honestly, he was the toughest). Here are some quick tips that will get you thinking about how to get them excited about the year of fruit and veggies ahead, and how to make you doubly determined to help they grow into the healthy toddlers, teens, and adults you want them to be, and we still strive to be.

1. <strong>You are what you eat.</strong> Truly, you are. Connect the dots for your kids. When they  eat sugar, they tend to get hyper and then crash and get cranky. When they don't eat the stuff that's good for their bodies, they won't group up to be big and strong. Tell them how the vitamins and minerals in fruit and veggies will help boost their immune system - making them a super hero against diseases. You know this is true - you need to TELL them. No one else seems to want to do it these days.

2. <strong>Clear out the Junk. </strong>In my house, when candy comes in, it gets eaten. If it's not here, we don't even think about it. Don't get me wrong, we have desserts in the house, but it's solely on a rotating basis. We get one dessert per kid per week. We live in the city and I don't have a ton of pantry space - so I like to limit what they are bringing in anyway. And, no junk goes beyond the kitchen. Because, when it does, no matter how honest that kid is, it gets eaten on the sly. Sorry, kiddos!

3. <strong>Be realistic about Sugar. </strong>Stop associating highly sugary foods like cereals with meals. In my mind, they are simply junk food that the kids may be able to eat but on a very very limited basis. They are not called breakfast in our home. Nor, can the kids ask for chocolate, marshmallow, or other sugar-laden cereals as a replacement for a meal. In our house it's called dessert.

4. <strong>Make them eat the good stuff First.</strong> Sure, they are going to get their treats, but why not make them work for it? It's exhausting saying no to treats, especially when they come home from school. So, I have one clear policy. Want a snack or a sugary treat? Show me something healthy you are going to eat first. A clementine, apple, or carrot are usually the go-to. This means they eat less junk later and sometimes forget about it all together (sometimes, I said).

5. <strong>BUY the good stuff. </strong>Too many of us hope our kids will try something when we go out, but we never think to bring it home and eat it ourselves. My kids tried beets one day when I got them in our CSA box and I went on a limb and steamed them. My older one gobbled them up. I never thought to cook them before.

6. <strong>Clean your produce IMMEDIATELY. </strong>Wash and trim all of your produce (even strawberries) before putting them in the fridge. This way, everyone can grab what they want when they want right away.

7. <strong>Rearrange your Fridge. </strong>Put all the healthy veggies and fruit right on the bottom so little hands can open the fridge and grab them readily. I guarantee little will go bad this way. Put all the less healthy stuff in harder-to-reach spots.

8. <strong>Stop associating SUGAR with LOVE. </strong>We are loving our kids to sheer obesity. Even I do this - when they are good, or do well on a test you want to reward them with a sugary donut or cookie. One swim coach at our club told me how sick he was of seeing parents give their kids sugar cookies bigger than their heads as rewards when they'd come out of the pool. Reward them with memories and experiences. Take them sledding, for a scavenger walk, play a game with them, teach them how to play a game of cards, watch a movie with them, read to them...the possibilities are truly endless. I find the busier I get my kids truly only want my time. The donut is just a back up - mostly for me to feel less guilty about not spending the time with them.

9. <strong>MARKET well. </strong>Just like cereals and junk food companies do, position healthy food to your kids like a marketing guru. Don't think it can work? Take a look at the recent campaign to get kids to eat halos mandarins. All my kids do is talk about the funny commercials and how hilarious they are. They are even now sold at some McDonald's. You have to pitch healthy eating just like the other pitching that normally surrounds our kids.

10. <strong>Practice what you PREACH. </strong>You can force your kids to eat things you won't even touch. Take the words 'weird', 'smelly', 'picky eater', 'digusting' out or your vocabulary. Make sure your kids watch you eating fruit and veggies and taking care of yourself. Your example will go a long, long way in their minds.

I can only give you advice if I take it myself. I quit my job as a TV reporter in 2005 to teach my kids how to eat. And, I've done it. Take it from me, it can work. But, it's hard work. I won't lie to you. My kids still tend to put up a fight when it comes to certain rules and foods, but when I stand firm and explain it to them, they typically give in.

But, my kids have their quirks and I have to respect them, too. My older daughter will eat almost any veggies but asparagus. She just cannot stand the taste. She's tried it for me enough times that I don't force it on her. But, the little one loves it. All I'm trying to say is that they will show you their personalities, but with my tips you'll show them good, healthy foods that will help those little personalities shine!

I know that I am.

I'd urge you not to forget the kids when shoring up the resolve to eat better and stock up on more fruit and veggies. Think they are hopeless? Think again. Use this blog site to give you inspiration throughout the year on how to get them (and you) excited to eat healthier in 2015.

Whenever folks see my kids gobbling up salads - spinach, kale, and even beets - in restaurants, many take a second look. It's just not the norm these days. But, it is in my home because I made healthy eating a priority for me, for them, and for my husband (honestly, he was the toughest). Here are some quick tips that will get you thinking about how to get them excited about the year of fruit and veggies ahead, and how to make you doubly determined to help they grow into the healthy toddlers, teens, and adults you want them to be, and we still strive to be.

1. <strong>You are what you eat.</strong> Truly, you are. Connect the dots for your kids. When they  eat sugar, they tend to get hyper and then crash and get cranky. When they don't eat the stuff that's good for their bodies, they won't group up to be big and strong. Tell them how the vitamins and minerals in fruit and veggies will help boost their immune system - making them a super hero against diseases. You know this is true - you need to TELL them. No one else seems to want to do it these days.

2. <strong>Clear out the Junk. </strong>In my house, when candy comes in, it gets eaten. If it's not here, we don't even think about it. Don't get me wrong, we have desserts in the house, but it's solely on a rotating basis. We get one dessert per kid per week. We live in the city and I don't have a ton of pantry space - so I like to limit what they are bringing in anyway. And, no junk goes beyond the kitchen. Because, when it does, no matter how honest that kid is, it gets eaten on the sly. Sorry, kiddos!

3. <strong>Be realistic about Sugar. </strong>Stop associating highly sugary foods like cereals with meals. In my mind, they are simply junk food that the kids may be able to eat but on a very very limited basis. They are not called breakfast in our home. Nor, can the kids ask for chocolate, marshmallow, or other sugar-laden cereals as a replacement for a meal. In our house it's called dessert.

4. <strong>Make them eat the good stuff First.</strong> Sure, they are going to get their treats, but why not make them work for it? It's exhausting saying no to treats, especially when they come home from school. So, I have one clear policy. Want a snack or a sugary treat? Show me something healthy you are going to eat first. A clementine, apple, or carrot are usually the go-to. This means they eat less junk later and sometimes forget about it all together (sometimes, I said).

5. <strong>BUY the good stuff. </strong>Too many of us hope our kids will try something when we go out, but we never think to bring it home and eat it ourselves. My kids tried beets one day when I got them in our CSA box and I went on a limb and steamed them. My older one gobbled them up. I never thought to cook them before.

6. <strong>Clean your produce IMMEDIATELY. </strong>Wash and trim all of your produce (even strawberries) before putting them in the fridge. This way, everyone can grab what they want when they want right away.

7. <strong>Rearrange your Fridge. </strong>Put all the healthy veggies and fruit right on the bottom so little hands can open the fridge and grab them readily. I guarantee little will go bad this way. Put all the less healthy stuff in harder-to-reach spots.

8. <strong>Stop associating SUGAR with LOVE. </strong>We are loving our kids to sheer obesity. Even I do this - when they are good, or do well on a test you want to reward them with a sugary donut or cookie. One swim coach at our club told me how sick he was of seeing parents give their kids sugar cookies bigger than their heads as rewards when they'd come out of the pool. Reward them with memories and experiences. Take them sledding, for a scavenger walk, play a game with them, teach them how to play a game of cards, watch a movie with them, read to them...the possibilities are truly endless. I find the busier I get my kids truly only want my time. The donut is just a back up - mostly for me to feel less guilty about not spending the time with them.

9. <strong>MARKET well. </strong>Just like cereals and junk food companies do, position healthy food to your kids like a marketing guru. Don't think it can work?

My girls were about 4 and 2, and dressing up, walking up steps, and knocking on doors was the goal. The candy was the sidebar. Sure, it was fun watching neighbors add to their stash, but once home it was about looking at their piles, yawning, and then passing out.

I, on the other hand, had other plans. It was about 10 p.m. The little ones were snuggled away, and the hubbie was safely snoring. I had to re-focus a bit in the dark of my daughter's room, but there they were in a neat pile to the side of her bed on the floor. All of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups she'd acquired that night. About a dozen. My mouth watered.

I sat down on the carpet in the dark intending to eat one. But, it was so delicious I had to have just one more. I just have this thing with chocolate and peanut butter. It's one sick addiction. I know. I own it. It owned me that night.

But, it was Halloween after all, why not one more? They were never going to notice...how about a fourth? It was better I was eating it them anyway. I was doing my kids a favor. I had a hefty pile of wrappers by the time I was done. And then the guilt set in.

And, I vowed never ever again would I let myself get to that point no matter the holiday no matter the event. I want to be in control of my eating and of my family's health. So, I have a few rules that I always put into place before any holiday event including this Friday and Halloween:

<strong>I always wake up and work out.</strong> Once I've put in an hour on the treadmill or with my trainer I'm less likely to feel sluggish and then give into cravings later. Feeling good has a snowball effect - in a good way.

<strong>I never skip a meal. </strong>The minute I skip out on a meal, it means I'm ready to fill that hunger pang with candy. No way. Not doing it.

<strong>I cook a wholesome meal for dinner. </strong>Because Halloween is about spending time with the kids and hanging out with the family, I love throwing something in the slow cooker in the morning. It's ready by the end of the day, and keeps warm even when we have company over. Try my <a href="http://www.indianasapplepie.com/blogs/indian-as-apple-pie/15715748-slow-cooker-punjabi-rajmah-spiced-kidney-beans">Spiced Kidney Bean recipe</a>. I make sure everyone - including the hubby and the kids - eat a warm, hot meal before we all head out to knock on doors. No one goes trick or treating w/out eating something healthy first.

<strong>I buy my candy the day before. </strong>I don't want the crap in my house. When it sits in the basement I not only sneak it, but so do my girls. We're only human and sugar is super addictive. Why even try to fight it? I'd rather spend my energy on other things.

<strong>I buy candy I don't want to eat. </strong>Right. No Reese's in my house. Not worth trying to fight the urge. I also like buying little bags of chips or pretzels to give out.

I let my girls enjoy their day. They compile their piles, count their candy, eat a bunch before bedtime, and then it sits in their room. <strong>We keep it in a spot tucked away in their closet on a shelf they can't really see or reach. </strong>When they want something they let me know. We pull it down and they eat what they want. But, we make it a little tough to reach on purpose.

And, as we get past Halloween..<strong>I start throwing the candy away little by little.</strong> And guess what? My kids barely notice. No, I don't donate it to kids in the inner city. I care about their health and their teeth as much as I do my own kids'. I'd rather give them real food if I am going to donate food.

And if you think I'm a bit of a party pooper - and don't know how to let my kids have a little fun once in awhile...well know that I don't think Halloween and our obsession with sugar is once in awhile anymore. Growing up, I can truly say it was a treat that we indulged in. Now, there's treat after treat after treat. In schools, at birthday parties, daily in the car on the ride home from school, at grandma's, at the pool as a reward after swim class, on the soccer field after your kid makes a goal, and on and on and on.

So, don't cry over me or my kids. I'm glad they are going to have their day. And, I'm glad that I know there's a limit to all the fun and sugar. I've lost a dress size since that bout with the candy. Not by indulging whenever I get a chance, but by being focussed and careful with what I eat and exercising every day 30 minutes or more. I've even given up sugary treats for now 18 months. I feel amazing.

My goal this year? Not to let one Reese's Peanut Butter Cut within five feet of our house.

Know that when you're looking to achieve those fitness and food goals, every single day matters.

No matter what you want to call it. Halloween. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Diwali. Get my point?

I can understand that for a parent who has not focussed on healthy eating at home, the prospect of turning things around can be overwhelming. You feel like you almost have to reinvent your whole life and on top of it, you wonder how your kids will react? Let's be honest. We're all afraid of our kids at least a little bit. I know I am at times. But, there's one thing to keep in mind.

It is never ever too late. And, don't you dare let someone convince you of any different.

Last night was a classic case. I want to let you in on a little secret. Sure, I write cookbooks and am testing a recipe virtually daily. But, my kids don't always want to eat what I made that day. Which leads to a lot of stress and scrambling. I don't cater to what they want, but they aren't big on heavy sauces - and when I hit those chapters - they kind of check out. Add to that 3 soccer teams between the two girls (don't ask), science projects for both, laundry, dishes, and oh, my own business. Life the last 6 months has been nothing less than chaotic and nerve wracking. I've basically been living in my car trying to get to games spread between Montrose and Humboldt Park - and driving smack in the middle of post work traffic.

So, you won't judge me if I tell you I've been relying on Whole Foods of late? Loads of sushi. Pizza. Pre-cut fruit, chips, and whatever else I can get my hands on that the kids will eat. I haven't felt good about it, because I know I advocate planning, prepping, and sucking it up.

This weekend we hit a new low. The hubbie bought chips as a snack because I was too busy and tired to chop veggies and make a dip for the kids and their friends as they worked on their science projects. Instead of a basic tortilla chip and salsa, he brought home two bags of Doritos. The bright red 40 food dye kind of chips that give me ulcers just to look at.

I sucked it up. Held my breath, and let them eat them - while I imploded quietly. That was it! I didn't care what they had to say, I was going to change things this week. And, I did.

I planned. I cooked in the morning, and post soccer had an amazing meal of lentils and rice set up for the girls. I know - they do love Indian food - they've grown up on it. But, your kids will love what you make as well. Just make it simple - and don't dole out a ton for them. Give it to them in small portions. Let them ask for more. Maybe a little salad that they cut up with you. Maybe even just sliced carrots with ranch dressing. Or, a slice of cucumber. A strawberry. Anything at all.

Aria told me it was the 'best meal' she's had in a long time. It likely is.

And, I learned that no matter where you and your kids are - just start there. Start slow. Start steady, and just keep going.

But, start. And, if you don't. You only have yourself to blame.

So, you won't judge me if I tell you I've been relying on Whole Foods of late? Loads of sushi. Pizza. Pre-cut fruit, chips, and whatever else I can get my hands on that the kids will eat. I haven't felt good about it, because I know I advocate planning, prepping, and sucking it up.

This weekend we hit a new low. The hubbie bought chips as a snack because I was too busy and tired to chop veggies and make a dip for the kids and their friends as they worked on their science projects. Instead of a basic tortilla chip and salsa, he brought home two bags of Doritos. The bright red 40 food dye kind of chips that give me ulcers just to look at.

I sucked it up. Held my breath, and let them eat them - while I imploded quietly. That was it! I didn't care what they had to say, I was going to change things this week. And, I did.

I planned. I cooked in the morning, and post soccer had an amazing meal of lentils and rice set up for the girls. I know - they do love Indian food - they've grown up on it. But, your kids will love what you make as well. Just make it simple - and don't dole out a ton for them. Give it to them in small portions. Let them ask for more. Maybe a little salad that they cut up with you. Maybe even just sliced carrots with ranch dressing. Or, a slice of cucumber. A strawberry. Anything at all.

Aria told me it was the 'best meal' she's had in a long time. It likely is.

And, I learned that no matter where you and your kids are - just start there. Start slow. Start steady, and just keep going.

But, start. And, if you don't. You only have yourself to blame.

It read, "I'm reaching out to see if you're interested in next week's parenting roundtable - we're talking about picky eaters. How much do you think picky-ness is innate vs. environmental?" When I called her within 2 seconds of receiving the email, all I said was, "You know this is what I'm all about, right?" Of course she did, and that's why she asked. Raising healthy eaters is the reason I quit my day job as television reporter years ago - though rest assured I'm not saying it's what you have to do.

I adored work, but came to realize that my kids meant more to me than my day job. And, I knew that if I did not take time to step off the hamster wheel that they would grow up without the eating habits my immigrant mother raised my brother and I with. My husband could not do it. He traveled all week - and he simply made more than I did as a local news reporter. My parents live hundreds of miles aways. And, my in-laws are local but just not mobile enough. So. It was me or it meant me putting up with mediocre dinners out of a box. The idea that my kids might grow up like this gave me hives.

And thus, my blog, indianasapplepie.com was born.

We grew up in an Indian-American (emphasis on Indian) household. I was born in India - raised outside of Philadelphia. My  mom - despite working - cooked Indian meals virtually daily. I truly felt that it was the least I could do - leave my girls with the legacy to appreciate good food. Real food. Food that connected them to their roots.

I decided the blog would be a human experiment. Could I 'undo' my kids' unhealthy food crutches by cooking Indian food daily and feeding it to them? The mission to do so was born out of desperation. Conviction. Hope. And, determination. My girls were young - 2 years old and 4. But, they had also fallen into habits (really my own crutches) of bright orange goldfish for snacks and boxed mac and cheese. The worst was when I was really bleary eyed from working the early morning (3 a.m. - 11 a.m. shift) and would muster just enough energy to pour dried cereal for dinner for all of us. Sometimes I managed milk and sometimes I didn't. Those were nights I was glad the husband was off in another state so he couldn't witness ours.

I have to say - the experiment is working.... I did it - but with a TON of really really hard work and determination that continues 7 years later. <em>This blog is all about those tips - and I have a ton more coming. I want to write a book about it one day. </em>

Well. That's what I was GOING to say on NPR tomorrow morning, but this evening I caught my 9-year-old in her room with her door shut sucking on a lollipop right before bedtime. Trust me. She NEVER does this - but her timing to do it this once could not have been worse. The night before I went on air and told all of you how to feed your kids right - how to get them to eat better - and here's my kid telling me with a smile how much she 'loves lollipops' and that's what made her do something 'sneaky'.

But, I think in this moment, I learned to take all the lessons I've been learning as I teach these girls how to eat, with the first one being - don't strive to be perfect. Perfection is overrated. And anyone that tells you otherwise - especially with food - is likely sucking up their kids' Halloween candy huddled up in a dark closet in the middle of the night. <em>Been there done that. </em>

Strive instead to be practical and own the results of your own actions. Too many of us pour guilt on ourselves for not doing certain things, but when someone calls us out we're the first to become defensive.

Instead of that, look inside. You know what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong. And, you can't blame your kid for not eating the blueberries if her only snack options were chips or ice cream after school. Nor, can you blame your kid for not eating real food if you've filled them up on that stuff all day. Get real. Get rid of the daily crutches for yourself - and get to working harder on behalf of your family's diet - whether you are mom, dad, grandpa, or grandma.

You don't have to be perfect. BUT, you do have to work hard if you want this for your kids. And, you have to be prepared to make some sacrifices yourself. Because, feeding your kids right is not about preaching to them about something you don't do yourself. It's about getting in the trenches with them. They learn best by example. And, you as their parent are their best source of information.

I do believe that a majority of our issues regarding so-called picky eating is environmental. We just assume that kids want dumbed-down food and ingredients. I cannot tell you how self conscious I feel when we are out eating and my kids' are ordering a caesar salad and eating soba noodles with chopsticks. People actually stop and stare - then come over and say how cool it is. I often feel like a circus act.

I believe kids actually have cleaner and more sensitive palates than many adults. It's just that eating sweet foods is more comfortable to us as humans than their bitter counterparts. Thus, why many say it takes about 10-12 tries for a kid to actually develop a taste for vegetables. I never rely on the first taste from my kids. I make them try things over and over and over again before I'll accept defeat. One week they said no to kiwis, but I offered it in small pieces over the course of a month and it became my 9-year-old's favorite fruit.

And whose to say what picky is? My kids eat just about every vegetable and/or fruit (mango/papaya/lychee/kale/spinach/kiwi). However, my older one hates cooked vegetables and won't eat things with heavy sauces, while the little one won't even taste chicken, fish, or beef. She will eat eggs though the older one won't. The older one won't eat food that's even a day old. Leftover pizza? Forget it! They want fresh food all the time. Making lunch for them is really rough sometimes. They do eat Indian food - though they like to complain about it. Often, they'll eat pizza out - come home and eat another meal of dal and rice. The little one loves naan. The older loves rice. They both can't stand Korean and Thai foods because of the smell of the fish sauce.

You could say in all fairness they are picky eaters. I just say they are human. They are learning their likes and dislikes - and that changes often on a daily basis. It's our job as their parents not to label them. Let them grow and learn and throw as much delicious food their way as possible (but we do first need to know what that is ourselves).

Teach them to cook. Help them plant a vegetable garden. Try a new food with them every week. Let them pick. Play food games with them where they close their eyes and tell you what they are eating (I always did that when I was cooking). Use peer pressure to your advantage - have them eat at friends' houses that have more adventurous eaters. Discuss nutrition with them. Tell them why a sweet potato is not only delicious but healthy as well. Don't talk about calories - I never did - but talk about vitamins and minerals and food groups. Have them read the number of grams of sugar in their cereal and compare it with others. Explain why too much sugar is not good for them.

It's a job. Plain and simple. But, I thought when you had them, you said you'd die for your kids?

I know how you feel. Take it from me. I was YOU. I AM you on some days.

You got this. Promise. Now, go throw out those chips.

But, I'd argue, how can you truly do that without first taking care of yourself? November 2012 I truly came face-to-face with this thought. That I could talk about eating healthier, getting exercise, being healthy all I wanted, but unless I put these things into practice, my kids would only pick up a fraction of what I was telling them. And, I knew that I truly needed to make some changes.

I'm not a nutritionist. I'm not a doctor. So read what I went through last year and use it as a springboard (if you choose) for yourself if you too need to lose a few pounds. But always consult a professional where you need to.

Now, let's put things into perspective. My 10 pound loss may not make me a contender for The Biggest Loser. I know that I have never been in a situation where I needed to lose large amounts of weight. But, these 10 pounds are part of 20 total that I've been wanting to lose for years and that just would not come off. My theory is that there are more of folks like me out there that just have to lose that last bit of bulge than folks that need to lose dozens upon dozens upon dozens of pounds.

Because I fall into this category, I faced my own unique challenges. Because I ate very healthy all day - mostly Vegan - and very little desire for processed sugar, I kind of wondered why I couldn't just eat what I wanted when I wanted. I had an affinity for carbs, and every nutritionist I spoke to always pushed me to 'just eat meat and yogurt'. I was truly, truly frustrated. I began to believe that I could NOT lose weight eating healthy foods and eating a plant-based diet. It was starting to play havoc on me mentally. Especially, because I also happen to make my living writing cookbooks - Indian cookbooks, - that focus on healthy plant-based options like grains and veggies.

The scale was not moving despite the fact that I've worked out my whole life. There was something missing. I'd argue this missing ingredient was - for me - consistency. Sure I ate well, but I was eating to much of the good stuff - often at the wrong times. AND I was feeding my hunger pangs with carbs to meet my immediate emotional needs.

So. How did I shift it around? Here's how - written in sequential order with dates.

<strong>How I Lost 10 Pounds in 2013</strong>

<strong>October, 2012. I faced the fat. </strong>I decided to finally call it what it was. Fat. I was fat. Not because the scale necessarily showed me that I was. (I still looked good on the outside - I was doing television appearances, giving interviews, speaking on stage, etc. BUT I just did not feel my absolute best.) I felt uncomfortable. The extra 15 pounds on me felt wrong. My jeans felt tight. When I got dressed to go out I didn't feel amazing. When I surfed again in Hawaii in Aug. 2012 (I used to live there and surfed weekly) I had trouble popping up on my board. And - I decided it was time to admit it to myself. I was feeling fat to myself. No more excuses. I really did not care what anyone else thought. I was doing this for myself and for my health - and to be a better role model for my kids. MY THEORY IS FAT IS HOW YOU FEEL. DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE? THEN GET WITH THE PROGRAM AND MAKE A CHANGE. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR YOURSELF.

<strong>October, 2012. I decided to change. </strong>I decided I was going to change the habits that had gotten me off track in the first place. The idea was NOT to lose 10 pounds - but to CHANGE habits. I didn't have to change everything, but there were some issues. Like, eating an unhealthy snack after dinner and late after putting the kids to bed. I almost felt like I was OWED something for getting through the day (I'm a single mom during the week AND an entrepreneur - it's very stressful to do everything when your hubbie is a road warrior). Not sleeping enough, not eating enough fresh veggies and salads (I'd just gotten out of the habit of doing this every day). Not drinking enough water. Eating desserts even when I truly was not in the mood for them. Eating shitty birthday cake at a kid's party just because it was there and offered to me. I learned to say 'no' to the stuff that was mediocre and 'yes' only to the really really good stuff that I truly wanted and meant a moment or memory.

<strong>November 2012. On a whim, I put together a support group. </strong>I created a closed Facebook page called Fit As Apple Pie where anyone that wanted could join as long as they agreed to post regularly and offer non-judgemental support of anyone in the group (You can join, too). If I wanted to pig out on pizza, I would post and I'd have instant support telling me not to...giving me ideas on how to avoid the binge, and why I should try eating something else. This support was so, so critical. There were other people like me out there. With bigger challenges. Folks that I could help and that in turn were helping me. We started slowly with 10 - 15 members and now we are at over 100 strong. I love my group. You have gotten me through a really tough year!

<strong>November, 2012. I decided to exercise every single day for at least 30 minutes. </strong>No excuses. Ever again. Every day I workout now whether at the gym or at home or running by the lake. I always get something in no matter how busy my days are. Before, I was skipping workouts on the weekends or would make up excuses here and there to the point where I worked out maybe 4 times a week tops. Now, I take my 7th day as a yoga/rest/recup day. Try and do something every day - whether a weighted hula hoop, push ups, bootcamp, swimming. You will have the time if you truly make the time. It took me till January, 2013 to put this habit into true practice. I now do bootcamp on MWF. On Tuesday I run with a running coach. Thursday I run again. Saturday I run or swim, and Sunday I do yoga. I do rest one day if I feel like it - like Saturdays when I was overwhelmed trying to write cookbook 3. IN MY BOOK - EVEN A BRISK WALK IS CONSIDERED A WORKOUT.

<strong>November, 2012. I put myself on the 50 percent diet.</strong> I started to just eat about half of what I normally would eat. So, I'd go out and share a meal with the husband instead of eating the whole thing. At home, I'd eat a little less rice. One less piece of pizza. It all counted as pulling back a little. I just wanted to help my body get used to eating less. I would eat slower as well. No more rushing my meals. But, I could eat as many veggies as I wanted - and all the time.

<strong>November, 2012. I said no to processed sugar - EVER. </strong>It was time to get rid of the crutches - slowly. Sure, moderation is great if it truly is moderation. My sugar addiction was not moderation. I'm not a big fan of sugar (which helps me in this category) but I liked a few cookies at night, then a few more, and then just one more. To kick the crutch I went 'no sugar' for a month. It didn't kill me and I felt great after that first week. I just don't even think about it anymore. I don't even take sugar in my coffee anymore. Try it for 2 weeks if you can and you'll lose that addiction, too. But, I'll warn you, it's hard in the beginning. I cannot tell you how many times I'd reach for a leftover from my kids or a bite of their pancakes and had to tell myself to stop, stop, stop. It helped to get a $100 bet on with my friend that we could/would do this together. In reality it took me till January to really be true to this, when our bet started. But, I wanted to start early so that I could have a head start to Jan. 1.

<strong>January, 2013. I said no to alcohol. </strong>I decided to kick alcohol out of my weekends so that I could really give my body time to regroup and recalibrate. Why ruin a good thing? I've stayed pretty much alcohol free largely for a year. Now, I'm totally in control and if I want a drink I do have it. One drink. Done. Over. Move on. I'm in control.

<strong>January, 2013. Committing to my early morning body cleanse. </strong><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicagoan-as-apple-pie/2013/12/mini-daily-cleanse-turmeric-lemon-tea-and-something-new/">Hot water, lemon, turmeric, and a few other additions. Every single morning I cleanse my body just a little bit. I don't have to luxury to leave my family for 2-week cleanse. this helps. </a>

<strong><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>March, 2013. I found an amazing bootcamp/workout group: </strong>Finally after years in Chicago looking for a trainer that actually cared about my individual progress, I found a great group in<a href="http://www.chicagofitperformance.com/"> Chicago Fit Performance</a>. They not only have great workouts that keep you challenged BUT work for my day. I can drop the kids off school and get in from 8 - 9 a.m. w/out missing a beat on my <strong>workday.</strong> I am sick of workouts that CALL themselves heavy duty workouts but fall short AND can't stand places where I go and no one even says hello to me. They seemingly could care less if I'm even there. I want a place that always knows I am there...give me a high-five when I get it right and workout with someone who CARES about me. </span></strong>

<strong>June, 2013. Go stupid carb free. </strong>I decided to largely give up stupid wheat and sugar. I don't like to promote fad diets like the gluten-free diet (unless medically you need to go this route) only because most folks that go this route replace their wheat products with similar products made out of corn flour, etc. I just kicked bread-muffins-and  out of my diet. So instead of eating wheat-based products, I would replace them with more filling grains, etc. So in the morning I would eat thin corn tortillas. I would have South Indian dosas for lunch (mine are made with brown rice or quinoa and lentils), and for dinner eat a ton of greens and a small amount of brown rice and/or quinoa.

<strong>August, 2013. </strong>Went to Italy and loved eating there. Ate regular pasta and pizza. Drank wine, but in moderation. I enjoyed my 12 days there and just took it meal by meal. I ate gelato only once at the end of the trip. Tried a homemade tiramisu. Again, ate for memories. NO SENSELESS EATING. I came back the same exact weight.

<strong>All of 2013: Closed my ears to the NOISE: </strong>I stopped listening to the 'pundits' that were telling me that I had it all wrong. That I needed meat in my diet to lose weight. Instead I ate what feels good to me. And for me that's lentils, grains, and loads of veggies. So, as I cooked and experimented with dishes for my new cookbook, <em>Indian For Everyone</em>, to be published in 2014, I would absolutely eat everything I cooked and feel so, so great having a bowl of warmed lentils over a bed of quinoa. Or, a bowl of Punjabi curried chickpeas as a soup. Or, some stir fried spinach or cauliflower and potatoes. Everything had delicious spices in it that made me feel fuller and healthier. <b>I also stopped listening to advice on drinking my food and doing long-term powdered cleanses. </b>My platform is the we can all lose weight and do right by eating the correct foods - real, unprocessed foods. So why are we not just doing that? I am flabbergasted when I tell 'experts' on nutrition that I eat so healthy and they say to sub my green juice with their powdered alternative. Now, really? REALLY? REALLY? If you don't eat the way I do. Have access to the time to make this stuff as I do maybe. Just maybe. But I don't trust other people making my food, frankly and handing it to me in a package. I need to know what is going into my food. The only cleanse that I did was recommended by my trainer, which was a three-day whole FOOD cleanse that involved drinking veggie and fruit smoothies that I blended myself in the Vitamix. My weight shifted after that cleanse by about 4 pounds. I will say, if you do a cleanse, do it with someone who really understands the product and can truly walk you through it on a daily basis. There are some out there like that, but again, I cannot do that to my fans who rely on me for whole food healthy eating tips.

<strong>November, 2013. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicagoan-as-apple-pie/2013/12/green-juice-the-indian-as-apple-pie-way/">Green Juice</a> EVERY SINGLE MORNING. </strong>You don't have to contribute to the industry's millions by buying green juice. Make it at home simply and affordably. I love my recipe and am simply addicted to it now.

<strong>2014 GOALS? </strong>I started already. I could care less that it's Christmas or New Year's. There's always an excuse not to do the right thing for your body. So, I've decided I am not using that as an excuse any longer. I want to lose 10 pounds in 2014. And I plan to continuing what I am doing above, but also plan to sip more green tea, drink more water on a regular basis, and love my life. I am determined to get into bed ON TIME. 9:30 p.m. lights out.

So, you think I am somehow deprived? Think again! Every day I eat amazingly prepped Indian foods. It's one of the healthiest - plant-protein rich diets in the WORLD. I eat lentils, beans, and brown rice and quinoa. I don't want for anything. When I miss junk, sure I have a bowl of chips. Yum. Then, it's over. When I want something sweet I truly do eat a date. It satisfies me now. Or a little dark chocolate with almonds. I love pizza and sometimes get the gluten-free from Father and Son on North Ave. but frankly I can and have eaten almost the entire 12-inch pie myself. Now that's plain gross. I'm still not in control with respect to pizza. Sigh. So it cannot be allowed in the house yet. But, I am getting there with everything else.

And, how do I feel so far? AMAZING. Everywhere I go I am getting compliments on the way I look. People who have not seen me in months are telling me they see a marked difference. I feel more energetic. I feel lean. I feel strong. I feel AMAZING. I am not giving that all up for ANY OF YOU. So next time I see you DON'T try to feed me or say you feel bad because I must be 'so' deprived. I'm doing just fine - and feeling younger and more empowered every single day. TRULY!

But, I'd argue, how can you truly do that without first taking care of yourself? November 2012 I truly came face-to-face with this thought. That I could talk about eating healthier, getting exercise, being healthy all I wanted, but unless I put these things into practice, my kids would only pick up a fraction of what I was telling them. And, I knew that I truly needed to make some changes.

I'm not a nutritionist. I'm not a doctor. So read what I went through last year and use it as a springboard (if you choose) for yourself if you too need to lose a few pounds. But always consult a professional where you need to.

Now, let's put things into perspective. My 10 pound loss may not make me a contender for The Biggest Loser. I know that I have never been in a situation where I needed to lose large amounts of weight. But, these 10 pounds are part of 20 total that I've been wanting to lose for years and that just would not come off. My theory is that there are more of folks like me out there that just have to lose that last bit of bulge than folks that need to lose dozens upon dozens upon dozens of pounds.

Because I fall into this category, I faced my own unique challenges. Because I ate very healthy all day - mostly Vegan - and very little desire for processed sugar, I kind of wondered why I couldn't just eat what I wanted when I wanted. I had an affinity for carbs, and every nutritionist I spoke to always pushed me to 'just eat meat and yogurt'. I was truly, truly frustrated. I began to believe that I could NOT lose weight eating healthy foods and eating a plant-based diet. It was starting to play havoc on me mentally. Especially, because I also happen to make my living writing cookbooks - Indian cookbooks, - that focus on healthy plant-based options like grains and veggies.

The scale was not moving despite the fact that I've worked out my whole life. There was something missing. I'd argue this missing ingredient was - for me - consistency. Sure I ate well, but I was eating to much of the good stuff - often at the wrong times. AND I was feeding my hunger pangs with carbs to meet my immediate emotional needs.

So. How did I shift it around? Here's how - written in sequential order with dates.

<strong>How I Lost 10 Pounds in 2013</strong>

<strong>October, 2012. I faced the fat. </strong>I decided to finally call it what it was. Fat. I was fat. Not because the scale necessarily showed me that I was. (I still looked good on the outside - I was doing television appearances, giving interviews, speaking on stage, etc. BUT I just did not feel my absolute best.) I felt uncomfortable. The extra 15 pounds on me felt wrong. My jeans felt tight. When I got dressed to go out I didn't feel amazing. When I surfed again in Hawaii in Aug. 2012 (I used to live there and surfed weekly) I had trouble popping up on my board. And - I decided it was time to admit it to myself. I was feeling fat to myself. No more excuses. I really did not care what anyone else thought. I was doing this for myself and for my health - and to be a better role model for my kids. MY THEORY IS FAT IS HOW YOU FEEL. DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE? THEN GET WITH THE PROGRAM AND MAKE A CHANGE. STOP MAKING EXCUSES FOR YOURSELF.

<strong>October, 2012. I decided to change. </strong>I decided I was going to change the habits that had gotten me off track in the first place. The idea was NOT to lose 10 pounds - but to CHANGE habits. I didn't have to change everything, but there were some issues. Like, eating an unhealthy snack after dinner and late after putting the kids to bed. I almost felt like I was OWED something for getting through the day (I'm a single mom during the week AND an entrepreneur - it's very stressful to do everything when your hubbie is a road warrior). Not sleeping enough, not eating enough fresh veggies and salads (I'd just gotten out of the habit of doing this every day). Not drinking enough water. Eating desserts even when I truly was not in the mood for them. Eating shitty birthday cake at a kid's party just because it was there and offered to me. I learned to say 'no' to the stuff that was mediocre and 'yes' only to the really really good stuff that I truly wanted and meant a moment or memory.

<strong>November 2012. On a whim, I put together a support group. </strong>I created a closed Facebook page called Fit As Apple Pie where anyone that wanted could join as long as they agreed to post regularly and offer non-judgemental support of anyone in the group (You can join, too). If I wanted to pig out on pizza, I would post and I'd have instant support telling me not to...giving me ideas on how to avoid the binge, and why I should try eating something else. This support was so, so critical. There were other people like me out there. With bigger challenges. Folks that I could help and that in turn were helping me. We started slowly with 10 - 15 members and now we are at over 100 strong. I love my group. You have gotten me through a really tough year!

<strong>November, 2012. I decided to exercise every single day for at least 30 minutes. </strong>No excuses. Ever again. Every day I workout now whether at the gym or at home or running by the lake. I always get something in no matter how busy my days are. Before, I was skipping workouts on the weekends or would make up excuses here and there to the point where I worked out maybe 4 times a week tops. Now, I take my 7th day as a yoga/rest/recup day. Try and do something every day - whether a weighted hula hoop, push ups, bootcamp, swimming. You will have the time if you truly make the time. It took me till January, 2013 to put this habit into true practice. I now do bootcamp on MWF. On Tuesday I run with a running coach. Thursday I run again. Saturday I run or swim, and Sunday I do yoga. I do rest one day if I feel like it - like Saturdays when I was overwhelmed trying to write cookbook 3. IN MY BOOK - EVEN A BRISK WALK IS CONSIDERED A WORKOUT.

<strong>November, 2012. I put myself on the 50 percent diet.</strong> I started to just eat about half of what I normally would eat. So, I'd go out and share a meal with the husband instead of eating the whole thing. At home, I'd eat a little less rice. One less piece of pizza. It all counted as pulling back a little. I just wanted to help my body get used to eating less. I would eat slower as well. No more rushing my meals. But, I could eat as many veggies as I wanted - and all the time.

<strong>November, 2012. I said no to processed sugar - EVER. </strong>It was time to get rid of the crutches - slowly. Sure, moderation is great if it truly is moderation. My sugar addiction was not moderation. I'm not a big fan of sugar (which helps me in this category) but I liked a few cookies at night, then a few more, and then just one more. To kick the crutch I went 'no sugar' for a month. It didn't kill me and I felt great after that first week. I just don't even think about it anymore. I don't even take sugar in my coffee anymore. Try it for 2 weeks if you can and you'll lose that addiction, too. But, I'll warn you, it's hard in the beginning. I cannot tell you how many times I'd reach for a leftover from my kids or a bite of their pancakes and had to tell myself to stop, stop, stop. It helped to get a $100 bet on with my friend that we could/would do this together. In reality it took me till January to really be true to this, when our bet started. But, I wanted to start early so that I could have a head start to Jan. 1.

<strong>January, 2013. I said no to alcohol. </strong>I decided to kick alcohol out of my weekends so that I could really give my body time to regroup and recalibrate. Why ruin a good thing? I've stayed pretty much alcohol free largely for a year. Now, I'm totally in control and if I want a drink I do have it. One drink. Done. Over. Move on. I'm in control.

<strong>January, 2013.

I hope in the meantime you'll pick up my other books, <em>The Indian Slow Cooker </em>and <em>Vegan Indian Cooking</em>, all available on Amazon.com, my other website www.indianasapplepie.com, and Whole Foods Market in Lincoln Park (on Kingsbury).

Enjoy this recipe. I drink it every single morning and have felt such a difference. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. And, my overall eating is better. And, if I'm completely honest, I'm REALLY regular now! I make a batch and keep it on hand in between meals to fill me up or take the edge off.

<b>Indian As Apple Pie Green Juice Smoothie
</b>Yield: 4 cups

<b> </b>3 stalks of kale, cleaned and trimmed (discard hard inner vein)
½ small cucumber, trimmed (I don't even peel it)
1-inch piece <i>karela </i>(bitter melon), I use the skin and remove the seeds * (optional)
5 – 6 sprigs parsley
1 small carrot, cleaned and trimmed
1 ½-inch piece fresh turmeric, peeled
2-inch piece ginger, peeled
2 small key limes, peeled (or 1 regular lime)
3 small pieces pineapple
1 tangerine, peeled
1 clove garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon flax seeds
5 ice cubes
3 cups cold water

Blend it all up. I use a Vitamix and blend on the highest setting at least 3 minutes. It's able to truly shred everything and make it seem like you are drinking a juice. If you don't have a Vita and are using a regular blender know that you'll have to likely add more water and maybe play with the recipe a bit.

* Karela is not easy to find. I get mine on Devon Ave. at Fresh Market. Whole Foods in Lincoln Park had it for about a week. As them for it. Although bitter melon has many amazing healing properties (including helping with diabetes),<a href="http://doctorsinghs.com/blog/herbs/health-benefits-of-bitter-melon-karela.html"> it can have an adverse effect if you are on diabetes medication</a>. Removing the seeds is important - the red covering can cause adverse health effect. Please consult you doctor before using.

In goes exactly 2 cups of water to boil. Then, I reach for the lemons. Not the coffee. Not the tea. Not the kids' empty lunch boxes that need filling. Not the television remote and not even the cell phone to check overnight messages. But, the electric kettle. Some lemons and my turmeric powder.

For nearly the last two years I've been drinking this hot water concoction as a mini cleanse. In Ayurvedic Medicine warm, lukewarm, or hot water with lemon has long been touted as a body cleanser. Growing up in an Indian home, I was always told to drink more water with lemon. When you drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach it immediately revs up your digestive system and cleanses your body. It truly works to flush your liver and kidneys of toxins, which can lead to weight loss. (Over the last year, I've lost 10 pounds with consistent daily exercise, smaller portioned meals, a self-imposed ban on wheat, a green juice every single morning, and this concoction first thing.)

Upon my mom's urging, I've also been adding fenugreek seeds. They are hard, beige squares like tiny chiclets gum (remember that from back in the day?). I put them into the cup along with my other ingredients. They go in hard enough to break a tooth on and then by the end of my drink are soft enough to chew up. I always knew they were good for me. They are bitter in flavor, usually a trademark of foods that are healthy for you, believe it or not. They are also great for combating diabetes. What I didn't know, but learned today as I research spices and other ingredients for my third book, <em>Indian For Everyone, </em>to be published in Fall 2014, is that  fenugreek seeds first and foremost are a legume, because they grow in pods. AND they can act as a natural appetizer suppressant! <a title="Fenugreek Seeds" href="http://www.greenchedy.com/common-herbs/complete-cheat-sheet-fenugreek-benefits/">"The natural soluble fiber galactomannan can swell in the stomach and thus, suppress appetite".</a>

Any little bit to help you get through your days, right? Try this quick recipe and you'll not only start your morning right, you'll reduce your colds over the winter. Turmeric powder is a natural anti-inflammatory and can help alleviate colds, mucus, and sore throats. It's pretty powerful stuff. And anything that helps you start the morning right can also only help you start the day right with the munchkins, right? My kids know how powerful these remedies are that in our house they actually ask for them for themselves when they have a slight cold or fever. Now, don't take this the wrong way. You should always use your brain and consult a doctor. But, the less doctor visits in the year the better, right? There are also a few things fenugreek seeds can aggravate, so be sure to read the article completely and do your own research. Consult a physician if you feel the need.

For now, drink up!

<strong>Anupy's Morning Lemon-Turmeric Infusion</strong>

juice of 1 small lemon (freshly squeezed is best)
1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder (why not get its amazing healing properties wherever you can.)
1/4 teaspoon red chile powder or cayenne (boosts metabolism)
1/2 - 1 teaspoon dried fenugreek seeds
pinch of raw cane sugar like Sucanat (my mom insists a little raw sugar helps stimulate the brain - but it's optional.)
1 1/2 cups boiling water

In a mug, add all the ingredients except the water. Then, add the water and mix well. Drink down. Eat up those fenugreek seeds at the end. <em>I keep a spoon in my cup to keep mixing - the turmeric tends to fall to the bottom. </em>

BAM!

It was a great night. She went way out of her way to make delicious homemade pizzas, pasta, and a few other sides for the kids - including the best homemade french fries I've ever tasted. They ate. They liked it. And that was that.

But, when we went downstairs to hang out the real party began. They moved fast and furious towards the veggie tray and dip.

My 8- and 10-year-olds started to double fist it with the carrot sticks - shoving them into their little mouths. They were so excited that they just hovered over the tray. Then they hit the celery .. and then the broccoli. And then the carrots all over again.

My friend just stared - looked from them to me. "Wow. How did you do that? I mean, they really gravitate towards the veggies. It's obvious."

Getting my kids to eat veggies and fruit - and love them both - was a surprisingly easy concept. I just kept all the good stuff around - all the time. I would offer it to them first whenever they got hungry. I kept insisting they try things. AND I always ate everything they did or wouldn't. I'd always lead by example. I kept fruit and veggies pre-washed in the bottom drawer of the fridge so their little hands could grab something at any time.

The tough part - as with anything - was MY OWN discipline. It was so easy (and still is) to get overwhelmed by your day and grab the bag of chips from the convenience store before heading to school pick up. And when they get up in arms and decide they don't want to eat what you offer what do you do?

I stay stick to your guns - but with a gentle edge. I always said when they were little - you have to at least try everything. And, I'd offer rewards when they did. It could be a round of applause, a hug...a sticker. Anything at all. And if they didn't want it - that was okay. I'd just try again the week after - often with better luck. That how we found out that little Aria does like kiwi after all!

So the concept isn't hard. It's - like everything else - the process that's grueling.

But, if you're wondering if it's worth all the effort? Think about that moment above and how you would feel.

Folks, take my word for it. It's well worth it!
