<p>My deep love for cities was shaped by many experiences as a youth: years as a graffiti writer, many Amtrak trips to Chicago and NYC with my father, devouring city-as-character films such as The Omega Man, Blade Runner, and Dawn of the Dead. But none were as formative as the many years I spent on my skateboard.</p>
<p>Street skating is primarily about the “line,” the creation of  a seamless flow from obstacle to obstacle. The skater views the built environment as a continuous canvas, looking for connections or “lines” wherever they can.</p>
<p>Street skating is about exploration. The skater thrives on finding little undiscovered little nooks in the city that have good energy and are serendipitously designed in a way that the skater can repurpose. The entire city is up for grabs and it is theirs. Skaters know their cities like no one else.</p>
<p>Street skating is about the vibe of the spot. A spot is a preferred location for extended skating sessions. A spot is judged by the uniqueness of its obstacles, proximity to home, how well known it is (possession and specialness), the view, its usefulness in downtime (seating, shade, refreshments, etc.), memories, legacy of previous skaters</p>
<p>Street skating is about adaptation and creative reuse. Ledges, benches, rails, curbs, parking lot islands, stairs, cones, walls, sculptures, grassy medians, and driveways all have official uses but those functions are thwarted and redefined in the mind of the skater. They are an unintentional infrastructure.</p>
<p>Street skating is about documentation. The more creative and odd the spot, the better it looks in photographs and films. The skater also loves to document city life in general. Their life is often a magnet for the strange, the raw.</p>
<p>Street skating is subterranean place-making. And the conditions that support a vibrant and hospital environment for street skating are the same conditions and principles that provide citizens spaces for engagement with their surroundings. The line, exploration, vibe, adaptation, documentation.</p>
<p>Urban design should understand movement as better defined and formed by the subconscious efficiencies of the pedestrian as opposed to utilitarian and vehicular rigidness. It should allow for lines and flow through the urban space.</p>
<p>Urban design should allow for discovery, creating spaces to be explored. Through exploration of these spaces they become imbued with memory and an interdependent contextual relationship between self and place. Urban design may not be able to create vibe, but best practices and strategies exist that can be utilized to distinguish a space, provide an opportunity for ownership through adaptation. This adaptation can be supported through flexibility of spaces and thinking universally and holistically about the possibilities of programmatic design as opposed to activation through programming.</p>
<p>And of course, thinking about space as cinematic, visually shifting with season and month and day and hour. Creating vistas and spaces of temporarily invested interest, places for both contemplation and collaboration. Spaces to be seen and to just be.</p>
<p>Skate and create.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.urban.org/expert.cfm?ID=zachmcdade">Zach McDade</a> of the Urban Institute recently asked whether loneliness should be a public policy concern. His <a href="http://blog.metrotrends.org/2013/05/reasons-public-policy-care-loneliness/">essay</a> got me thinking about the loneliness I experienced over the past decade while moving to and living in several cities, both in the US and abroad.  I realized that each city offered different challenges or opportunities for mitigating loneliness, and those differences often depended on the infrastructure and establishments that existed in each place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The loneliness that comes with moving to a new place extends beyond being far from family, making new friends, and building a new professional community.  I am lucky that I’ve had access to an automatic community in each new place I’ve lived (mainly through work or school).  Even so, it takes time to develop a connection to a place, a sense of camaraderie with strangers. I’ve found that the disconnect that exists before these bonds form plays a large role in the loneliness of relocation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Considering my own attempts to overcome loneliness in new places, I propose that planners, policy makers, designers, and entrepreneurs may be able to abate loneliness by concentrating on three main factors:</p>
<p><strong>* Pedestrian activity</strong>. There’s nothing like walking past others on the street, seeing their faces, observing their clothes, and wondering what they have in their bags, to foster a sense of community. When I lived in Paris I spent hours walking around the city on weekends.  Moving slowly through my new city and experiencing life from the sidewalk allowed me to develop a strong connection to the anonymous collective of other pedestrians and to the built environment that I explored on foot.  When I lived in Philadelphia I passed some of the same people every day as I walked to work.  We never spoke, but seeing the same figures over and over &#8211; and realizing that they saw me, too – helped me understand that, in some ways, we were all accountable to one another.  That sense of responsibility to the collective community and to my urban environment reliably alleviated feelings of loneliness that I might have been experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>* Visually varied commercial establishments</strong>.  Irvine, California, was the loneliest place I’ve ever lived, even though I had a strong group of friends and colleagues there. I attribute this loneliness in part to the pre-fab placelessness of the city’s monotonous upscale strip malls and the chain stores they contained.  Nearly indistinguishable from establishments I’d visited elsewhere, they offered a false promise of familiarity.  Instead of connecting me to a known setting, they ultimately proved even more isolating because they bore no unique connection to the specific place where they appeared.  When I ventured to Long Beach or Costa Mesa, I found shops and eateries that didn’t look or feel like they were any other store in any other city.  There, my loneliness would begin to peel away, even as I sat by myself.</p>
<p><strong>* Public Transportation</strong>. It is easy to feel cut off from your broader surroundings when cooped up in the bubble of a personal vehicle.  Traveling with others, seeing the city together, facilitates a feeling of community.  In Paris, New York, Philadelphia, and Austin, I developed a sense of belonging to the place by shuffling on and off the metro, the train, or the bus with others.  Especially because my fellow travelers were strangers, it was meaningful to think that we similarly experienced the odors or the panhandlers, the last minute schedule change or the conductor’s comical way of announcing the next stop.  It is hard to feel isolated when you and a stranger share a befuddled look as the man on the other side of the subway car starts clipping his nails in public.</p>
<p>Although it is ultimately up to individuals to choose to walk, to dine at a unique restaurant, or to take the bus, planners, policy makers, designers, and entrepreneurs play an important role in alleviating loneliness when they make those choices possible.</p>

Gamers could lay roads, power lines, and zone areas. It was awesome.</p>
<p>I remember buying the game at the beginning of a family camping trip in 1989, when the game came out. Buying a computer game at the beginning of a camping trip was a horrible idea. I spent the entire week in a sweaty pop-up trailer pouring over the <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/manual/index.html">manual</a> (back when video games had manuals), waiting for the day that we’d return home and I could boot up and play. The hefty book began “SimCity is the first of a new type of entertainment/education software, called system simulations. We provide you with a set of rules and tools that describe, create, and control a system.“ It had me at system simulation. The manual even included an <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/manual/history.html">essay</a> by Cliff Ellis entitled “History of Cities and City Planning” as well as a hefty <a href="http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/simcity/manual/bibliography.html">bibliography</a>.</p>
<p>When I did finally play &#8211; and boy did I play &#8211; SimCity taught me that cityscapes were pliable. SimCity taught me <a href="http://www.edmundconway.com/2013/03/simcity-its-a-bit-like-azerbaijan/">economics</a>. It taught me that decisions have <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/26/simcity-is-smarter-than-you-even-if-you-re-an-urban-planner.html">great consequences</a>. And I’m not alone. The game has inspired thousands, many of whom entered <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3005159/simcity-inspired-careers">urban planning</a> because of SimCity.</p>
<p>Today Electronic Arts is releasing a new version of SimCity again, the first one in a decade. They’ve dropped any pretense of sequel; presumably <em>this</em> is the definitive version of the game. I haven’t played it yet, but I’ve bene pouring over the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOSNdmSvhaU">previews</a> like I did the manual in that tent nearly 25 years ago. Maxis, the creators of the game, have made some big changes.</p>
<p>What can real-life city planners learn from these changes?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cities are too big.</strong> In SimCity 3000 you could make a <em>huge</em> city. <a href="http://imperar.webs.com/">This guy</a> even figured out how to populate the landscape with six million people. That’s about the most anyone’s ever stacked into one SimCity map &#8211; not that his digital inhabitants enjoy living in a totalitarian sim-nightmare. And maybe that’s why the designers of the new SimCity trimmed things down, only allowing for a comfortable 300,000 “sims” (but up to one million). Likewise, the American city is <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/increbile-shrinking-city-detroit-becoming-ghost-town-20110323-095202-383.html">shrinking</a>. Cities &#8211; digital or otherwise &#8211; aren’t about growing anymore, they’re about focusing. Those are different things.</li>
<li><strong>Think in terms of regions, not cities.</strong> Because of the map size restriction, the designers want players to focus more in regions, not city boundaries. This means you might have a downtown “region” connected to several other regions. Some might be industrial, others feeding tourism in, another serving as research district. Maybe it’s time Indianapolis start thinking more regionally as well. Would it would it look like for Indianapolis to regionalize? The biggest cities &#8211; Chicago and New York &#8211; already do this.</li>
<li><strong>Cities are connected.</strong> You can’t play the new version of SimCity without being online. If your internet connection is off, tough luck. Your city won’t work. And when you do play, cities from other real-life players will appear next-door. In some cases they might help by feeding in educated citizens to run your nuclear power plant. But in others, this reliance might prove problematic, as it did for <a href="http://kotaku.com/5988286/simcity-won-and-broke-my-heart-in-just-three-days">Mike Fahey</a>. His coal city supplied power, while the neighboring and more prosperous city supplied waste management and emergency services. But when Fahey went to restart and cleaned house, it devasted the neighboring city. Whoops. Maybe we should be watching Carmel’s back on more than just transporation.</li>
<li><strong>Citizens are the new spreadsheets.</strong> Previous versions of SimCity relied heavily on top-down advice, with complicated spreadsheets and snotty <a href="http://www.andywest.org/pr/simcity/basics/advisors.html">advisors</a> spouting often useless advice. This new version lets you tail a “Sim” from the time they wake up to the time they go back to bed. Or you can follow a specific police car on its beat. The city is smart. Real life isn’t quite like that, but it’s closer than it ever has been, thanks to Twitter and Facebook. Moreover, the concept of the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/technology/nyu-center-develops-a-science-of-cities.html?ref=technology&amp;_r=1&amp;">smart city</a>“ means that “<a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2013/02/on-the-smart-city-a-call-for-smart-citizens-instead.html">smart citizens</a>“ aren’t far behind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, in the end SimCity is just a game &#8211; its rules contort urban planning to <em>fun</em>. It will never be as accurate as some of us <a href="http://miketremblay.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/simcity-planning-what-maxis-got-wrong-in-the-new-simcity/">want it to be</a>. So maybe the best thing to do with the new SimCity is let it inspire a whole new generation of players into becoming urban planners in twenty years, maybe even future mayors. Someone will have to fend off Godzilla <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAvhWF7tTPo">attacks</a> on Indianapolis.</p>

<p>What if….</p>
<p>Community engagement . . . the perfect democratic ideal. At least that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s supposed to work. Our government acts to create laws and provide services to benefit us, the community. I mean, that&#8217;s the idea right? So it only makes sense that the community should have a say. And every well-meaning government official really wants us to have a say too.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying. Mayor Ballard is nearing his 50th Mayor&#8217;s Night Out in 5 years. He follows a good rule of community engagement – he goes out into the community to hear what we have to say. He answers our questions, listens to concerns and he has a pretty amazing follow-up protocol to make sure that each citizen that speaks up at these events gets their concern investigated. But, in my dream world, we wouldn&#8217;t come to these events just to complain about problems.</p>
<p>What if we came to these events prepared with solutions to our problems? What if, instead of hearing from complaining citizens, the Mayor heard from handfuls of people that were focused on one particular problem, and offered a solution?</p>
<p>What if, instead of having the same people show up each year at these events, he invited a new group of citizens to speak to him directly about a particular problem? What if the end result of that meeting was a white paper that his cabinet would investigate more deeply? What if the cabinet could promise to report back to the public with their findings and recommendations? What if Mayor Ballard&#8217;s administration followed that protocol 30 times in the next three years?</p>
<p>A recent Pew Research Council survey says that nearly three-fourths of all Americans don&#8217;t trust the Federal Government. I wonder what those same people would say about their local government. I wonder if they believe that their local government is acting in their best interest. If they don&#8217;t believe, it&#8217;s my guess that they feel like they are not engaged in the decisions that are made for their community.</p>
<p>What would get you engaged in our local government?</p>
