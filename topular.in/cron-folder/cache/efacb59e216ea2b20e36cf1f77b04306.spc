He purportedly came to the United States in 1883 with his first wife (that we know of) Annie.  What followed was almost 25 years of bigamy and murder.  He became infamous for poisoning his wives shortly after taking their money and earned the nickname “The Bluebeard Murderer” after the French folktale published in 1697 in which “Bluebeard” murders his wives.

He wed over 50 wives illegally and bilked them out of different amounts of money but murdered anywhere from a confirmed 15 to upwards of 30.

He was finally tried and convicted of only one murder and that was his second to last wife, Maria Walcker-Hoch who lived with him at 6430 Union Avenue.   He supposedly married Maria Walcker on December 10, 1904 in Chicago and almost exactly one month later on January 11, 1905 she was dead of Nephritis or inflammation of the kidneys.  Within five days he married Maria’s sister, Emilie Fischer from Joliet.  Three days later Hoch fled with $750 and Emilie reported him to the police as a swindler and bigamist.  The police became suspicious and had Emilie’s sister exhumed and they found 7.6 grams of arsenic in the body.

Hoch was indicted for bigamy and an arrest warrant was issued.  Hoch had made the mistake of asking his landlady, a Mrs. Kimberly, in New York to marry him within 24 hours of meeting her.  She contacted the police suspecting him to be Hoch and he was subsequently arrested and extradited back to Chicago where he was charged with the murder of Maria Walcker-Hoch.  (On a side note I believe that according to Cook County marriage records Walcker had actually gotten married to Hoch under the name Schippnick.  Who knows maybe she was trying to rip him off.)

The trial started April 19, 1905 and Hoch was convicted of murder on May 20<sup>th</sup>.  His original death by hanging was scheduled for June 23, 1905.

Hoch had avoided the hanging a number of times while in custody.  Governor Deneen granted him a reprieve until July 28<sup>th</sup>.  Within an hour of his hanging he was given another reprieve until August 25<sup>th</sup>.  Before the August 25<sup>th</sup> date, the Illinois Supreme Court agreed to hear his case but on December 15<sup>th</sup> handed down its verdict which supported the lower court’s ruling.  The Supreme Court set his date of Execution to be February 23, 1906.

Comerford, Hoch's Attorney" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/files/2016/02/The_Daily_Free_Press_Sat__Feb_24__1906_-232x300.jpg" width="232" height="300" /></a> Frank D. Comerford, Hoch's Attorney[/caption]

On the date of Hoch’s execution his attorney, Frank D. Comerford, attempted to make an appeal to the Federal Court on the basis that Hoch’s 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment rights had been violated because his wife was purportedly coerced by authorities to testify against her husband and commit perjury  (Of course she and 49 others were not his legal wives) Judge Landis denied his petition for a writ.

One day before his execution Hoch was moved to the Death Chamber of the County Courthouse and Jail (Now<a href="http://www.friedmanproperties.com/portfolio/court-house-place" target="_blank"> Courthouse Place Office Building)</a> where he woke up and ate his breakfast sparingly.  He received several visitors on that day.  His first visitor at 9am was his spiritual advisor F.W. Schlechte.  He met the Reverend Schlechte with a military salute and they studied the Bible for about an hour.  His next visitor was a very strange young man who introduced himself as a hypnotist and medical student.  The “hypnotist” had slipped past the guards and told Hoch, “Look into my eyes”.  Hoch told the guards that he was a “crank” and only managed to make him tired.  The crank was removed.  His last visitor was his latest wife Emilie Fishcer-Hoch.  He bid her a fond farewell at about 6pm and retired with a cigar which he smoked until it burned his fingers.  He then reclined in his bed but according to guards did not sleep.

He was supposed to die sometime between 10am and 11am on the 23<sup>rd</sup> but Jailer Whitman postponed it to as long as 2pm as they waited for Judge Landis’s decision.

[caption id="attachment_930" align="alignleft" width="225"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/files/2016/02/Criminal-Courts-Building-1964.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-930" alt="The Criminal Courts Building where Hoch was hung is now a landmark and office building" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/files/2016/02/Criminal-Courts-Building-1964-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a> The Criminal Courts Building where Hoch was hung is now a landmark and office building[/caption]

Upon hearing that Landis had refused a writ of habeas corpus the death warrant was read to Hoch who stepped up to the gallows at 1:32pm.  His final words were, “ Oh Lord, our Father, forgive them all.  They know not what they do.  They hang an innocent man.  I am innocent.  Goodbye.”

The trap was dropped and Hoch died of a broken neck almost instantly.  The body was lowered and handed off to undertaker Ernst Matz.  (The <a href="http://www.matzfuneralhome.com" target="_blank">Matz Funeral Home </a>is still in operation)

Meanwhile Hoch’s attorney was filing an appeal to the writ and it was approved even after his client’s death.  Comerford vowed that if the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the denial of the writ that he would bring murder charges against all persons involved in the hanging.

Meanwhile it seemed that no cemetery wanted to allow a murderer to be buried on their property.  Even Waldheim that accepted a number of the anarchists from the Haymarket riots (Spies, Parsons, Engel and Fischer) refused.  In fact officials from Waldheim stated that the burials of the anarchists had brought such unpleasant notoriety to their cemetery that under no circumstances would they ever allow another body of a person executed for a crime to be buried in their cemetery.

Both are still somewhat mysteries.

On Feburary 20, 1979, Allan Showery was on the verge of becoming a free man.  The jury in the murder case was deadlocked and a mistrial was declared.  But something happened on the two year anniversary of her death.  On February 22, 1979, Showery appeared with his attorney in front of Judge Barbaro and against his attorney’s advice plead guilty to the crime of Teresita’s murder!

Showery was sentenced to 14 years in prison (the minimum term for murder at the time) and four additional concurrent 4 year terms for arson and burglary.

He was sent to Stateville Penitentiary where he was paroled in July 1983 after only a little over four years.

I believe that Showery is still alive and getting ready to reach the age of 70.  It seems that after he was released he re-joined a mysterious woman named “Naomi” who attended his court hearings and in the late 1980s moved in with a female relative in Colton, California.  After that he came back to live in Chicago for a short stint at 1901 W. Pryor near Blue Island.  After that he returned to the area where he lived prior to the murder, New York City.

I have been able to trace Showery back to New York up until 2004 but after that it is somewhat of a mystery although there is reason to believe he is still alive and probably still haunted by the voice that convicted him in 1979.

According to the book, “Teresita, The Voice From the Grave”, Bonus Books, Inc., Chicago, 1992 by long time Chicago Tribune reporters John O’Brien and Edward Baumann, Teresita’s family took her body back to Dumaguete City in Negros Oriental, The Philippines.

According to O’Brien and Baumann, The Basa Mansion still existed on Colon Street and was occupied by Socorro Basa’s sister, Lourdes Calumpang as well as Teresita’s aunt and family.

Teresita was supposed to have been resting across the street at Santa Catalina Cemetery.

The problem I have is that there currently is no Santa Catalina (St. Catherine) Cemetery anywhere in Dumaguete City.  There is a Santa Catalina Church (Also called the Dumaguete Cathedral) off of Colon Road which at one point (at least as far back as 1897) had a cemetery.  Now it could have well been renamed since 1992 but there doesn’t exist any cemeteries off of Colon Street or near the church currently.

[caption id="attachment_924" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/files/2016/02/Dumaguete_Cathedral.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-924 " alt="Santa Catalina Church or what is now known as the Dumaguete Cathedral in The Philippines near where Teresita Basa was purportedly buried" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/files/2016/02/Dumaguete_Cathedral-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> Santa Catalina Church or what is now known as the Dumaguete Cathedral in The Philippines near where Teresita Basa was purportedly buried[/caption]

There are two cemeteries about a mile northwest of the location and they are called Bogo Public Cemetery and Dumaguete Memorial Park.   Neither of those cemeteries seem to be overseen by the Roman Catholic Church of which Teresita was a devout member.

There is also an additional cemetery about 3 miles west and that is called The Gardens Memorial Park which again does not appear to be connected to the Catholic Church.  Also about 1.5 miles to the west is the Bagacay Cemetery that seems to be overseen by the World Vision Mission Church.

There is a newer looking park directly across Colon Street and adjacent to St. Catherine’s Church.  The park is called Quezon Park and could be built on an area that may have contained a cemetery at one point.

On the website <a href="http://www.findagrave.com" target="_blank">Find-A-Grave</a> there is an obscure reference to a Dumaguete Roman Catholic Cemetery but it does not have a physical location listed and only one interment entered as Lee Porter Hamilton.

Could Teresita have been buried and continue to lie in a small churchyard cemetery or was she at one point buried in a St. Catherine Church Cemetery but then moved to make way for a new city park.

Could it also be misinformation given for publication to deter the curious and disrespectful.  Whatever the case may Teresita rest in peace.

I just about lost my mind when I saw that but you have to know the history to understand my reaction.

The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office’s mission, according to their website,  is to ensure public health and safety by performing autopsies and postmortem examinations to determine cause and manner of death for individuals who die in Cook County.

Prior to 1976, Cook County had a Coroner who was an elected official (did not have to be a medical person) who presided over a public inquest similar to a court hearing in which the Coroner’s Jury looked over evidence presented by various people to help determine the case of death.  These cases were public and the records created by this inquest are public records as well.

I conduct a good amount of research as part of my profession and I request a good amount of public records from various sources and have never run into a public office as inhospitable to the public’s right to records as this office.

I can't believe the excuses coming from this office as to why they cannot provide records.  Again, I am not talking about any records since it became a Medical Examiner’s Office but referring to Coroner’s Inquest Records.

I can only speak about my own personal experiences with the office because I don’t like relying on hearsay accounts.

I have only requested three Coroners Reports for myself in the last 10 years and can say that I have never received any reports and only excuses when I would call to follow up.  In one instance I called about a request and always received the same answer.  The person on the phone said that the person who pulled records from the “warehouse” only would go once per week and the records were quite the mess and it could take about 6 months for a response.

Now I completely understand about how records can sometimes be a mess so I gave it six months and then called back.  The person on the phone asked my how old I was.  I said that I was 42 years old.  She then said that I shouldn’t expect the report until I was 82!

I am not kidding!  That was the response!  I actually had to laugh and they laughed as well and I think they may just have been frustrated with the whole process and really didn’t know how else to respond.

I pretty much gave up requesting documents after that until I became involved as a researcher with the family members of Barbara and Patricia Grimes.  I had been researching <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/2015/12/unsolved-chicago-grimes-sisters-murder-is-59-years-old/" target="_blank">the 1956 murder of Barbara and Patricia</a> and had the opportunity to meet Jim Grimes who is one of the younger brothers of the girls.  I had read a number of accounts of the Coroner’s inquest from the newspapers who were in the public room reporting this public hearing. (I wonder how many times I can use the word public in a sentence)  Jim Grimes expressed some interest in receiving a copy of the transcripts of the inquest for the family to have.  They were never given a copy back in 1957 when the inquest took place.  I told him that he might have better luck sending a letter to the Medical Examiner’s Office and stating who he was.  The Grimes Sisters Murder is one of the most famous unsolved cases in Chicago history.

We received a response back from them (wonders never cease) and they said that the file was over 400 pages so that we would need to come up with over $1,200.00!  That’s right you heard it correctly, $1,200.00!  It was actually slightly more than that but I can’t remember the exact number.  Jim called the office and explained that he was the living brother of the girls and while the employees there were very kind and professional they stated that the amount that have to charge is set by Illinois State Statute!  And guess what…they were correct!

I found it hard to believe that there could exist a State Statute that could be at odds with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act but there most certainly is.

Of course Jim Grimes could not come up with $1,200.00 and I didn’t have the money lying around so I told him to remind the M.E.’s office that they are required by law to at least let us review the file in the office at no charge.  They did agree to let us in the office to review the file but only as someone sat with us (which I understand for security reasons) and they limited us to 90 minutes.  We could take hand notes but no photographs.

Unfortunately we only reviewed the copies that they had made so we don’t know if there were other files that weren’t copied.  After our ninety minutes we took our notes and left.  Of course in the defense of the employees they were very friendly and they really seemed to care and at one point recommended that maybe we should have a fundraiser to raise the money so that the family could have a copy.  They said that they could hang onto the copies for a while but if we couldn’t put the money together they would have to shred the copies.

Many of the excuses I heard from the M.E.s office had to do with the organization of records and the lack of staff.  I actually wrote Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle a letter and a note on the their website stating what the issues were and that I had access to volunteers that would be willing to help organize things as well as running and making copies for persons requesting copies but that letter went unanswered.

I also suggested that maybe the older Coroner’s files should become part of the Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court Archives.  I visit the Archives about once per week and have always been amazed by their efficiency and superior public customer service.  They provide access to court records going back to the Chicago Fire of 1871 and prior and the requests take one week on average to pull from the warehouse while the cost of copies are minimal.  Again, that suggestion went in one ear and out the other if it was ever heard at all.

So basically my beef is with the fact that the statute that governs the cost of copies for transcripts in the custody of the Medical Examiner’s Office ($5 per page) are directly at odds with the Illinios Freedom of Information Act. (There is a loophole in the Illinois FOIA that states in 5 ILCS 140/6  Sec 6 (b<i>).. Except when a fee is otherwise fixed by statute)</i>

You can read both for yourselves here:

<a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=85" target="_blank">Illinois Freedom of Information Act</a> (scroll down to section 6 which covers fees)

<a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=096-1161" target="_blank">State of Illinois, Public Act 096</a> (which covers ridiculous fees for public documents)

So forgive me if I don’t applaud the fact that the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office found historical documents that they are responsible for finding and preserving and just in time for Valentines Day!

But if you do want to read the article on their stupendous job you can read it<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3444390/Autopsy-reports-1929-Valentines-Day-massacre.html " target="_blank"> here</a>

A member of my facebook group<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/StrangeChicagoHistory/" target="_blank">, Chicago History the Stranger Side,</a> posted an article yesterday about how the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office is getting press for locating autopsy reports for the St. Valentines Day Massacre that took place on Valentines Day (creative name huh?) in 1929.

[caption id="attachment_915" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/chi-massacre-scene4-20040128.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-915" alt="The carnage inside the SMC Cartage Company after the St. Valentine's Day Massacre" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/chi-massacre-scene4-20040128-300x234.jpg" width="300" height="234" /></a> The carnage inside the SMC Cartage Company after the St. Valentine's Day Massacre[/caption]

I just about lost my mind when I saw that but you have to know the history to understand my reaction.

The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office’s mission, according to their website,  is to ensure public health and safety by performing autopsies and postmortem examinations to determine cause and manner of death for individuals who die in Cook County.

Prior to 1976, Cook County had a Coroner who was an elected official (did not have to be a medical person) who presided over a public inquest similar to a court hearing in which the Coroner’s Jury looked over evidence presented by various people to help determine the case of death.  These cases were public and the records created by this inquest are public records as well.

I conduct a good amount of research as part of my profession and I request a good amount of public records from various sources and have never run into a public office as inhospitable to the public’s right to records as this office.

I can't believe the excuses coming from this office as to why they cannot provide records.  Again, I am not talking about any records since it became a Medical Examiner’s Office but referring to Coroner’s Inquest Records.

I can only speak about my own personal experiences with the office because I don’t like relying on hearsay accounts.

I have only requested three Coroners Reports for myself in the last 10 years and can say that I have never received any reports and only excuses when I would call to follow up.  In one instance I called about a request and always received the same answer.  The person on the phone said that the person who pulled records from the “warehouse” only would go once per week and the records were quite the mess and it could take about 6 months for a response.

Now I completely understand about how records can sometimes be a mess so I gave it six months and then called back.  The person on the phone asked my how old I was.  I said that I was 42 years old.  She then said that I shouldn’t expect the report until I was 82!

I am not kidding!  That was the response!  I actually had to laugh and they laughed as well and I think they may just have been frustrated with the whole process and really didn’t know how else to respond.

I pretty much gave up requesting documents after that until I became involved as a researcher with the family members of Barbara and Patricia Grimes.  I had been researching <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/2015/12/unsolved-chicago-grimes-sisters-murder-is-59-years-old/" target="_blank">the 1956 murder of Barbara and Patricia</a> and had the opportunity to meet Jim Grimes who is one of the younger brothers of the girls.  I had read a number of accounts of the Coroner’s inquest from the newspapers who were in the public room reporting this public hearing. (I wonder how many times I can use the word public in a sentence)  Jim Grimes expressed some interest in receiving a copy of the transcripts of the inquest for the family to have.  They were never given a copy back in 1957 when the inquest took place.  I told him that he might have better luck sending a letter to the Medical Examiner’s Office and stating who he was.  The Grimes Sisters Murder is one of the most famous unsolved cases in Chicago history.

We received a response back from them (wonders never cease) and they said that the file was over 400 pages so that we would need to come up with over $1,200.00!  That’s right you heard it correctly, $1,200.00!  It was actually slightly more than that but I can’t remember the exact number.  Jim called the office and explained that he was the living brother of the girls and while the employees there were very kind and professional they stated that the amount that have to charge is set by Illinois State Statute!  And guess what…they were correct!

I found it hard to believe that there could exist a State Statute that could be at odds with the Illinois Freedom of Information Act but there most certainly is.

Of course Jim Grimes could not come up with $1,200.00 and I didn’t have the money lying around so I told him to remind the M.E.’s office that they are required by law to at least let us review the file in the office at no charge.  They did agree to let us in the office to review the file but only as someone sat with us (which I understand for security reasons) and they limited us to 90 minutes.  We could take hand notes but no photographs.

Unfortunately we only reviewed the copies that they had made so we don’t know if there were other files that weren’t copied.  After our ninety minutes we took our notes and left.  Of course in the defense of the employees they were very friendly and they really seemed to care and at one point recommended that maybe we should have a fundraiser to raise the money so that the family could have a copy.  They said that they could hang onto the copies for a while but if we couldn’t put the money together they would have to shred the copies.

Many of the excuses I heard from the M.E.s office had to do with the organization of records and the lack of staff.  I actually wrote Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle a letter and a note on the their website stating what the issues were and that I had access to volunteers that would be willing to help organize things as well as running and making copies for persons requesting copies but that letter went unanswered.

I also suggested that maybe the older Coroner’s files should become part of the Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court Archives.  I visit the Archives about once per week and have always been amazed by their efficiency and superior public customer service.  They provide access to court records going back to the Chicago Fire of 1871 and prior and the requests take one week on average to pull from the warehouse while the cost of copies are minimal.  Again, that suggestion went in one ear and out the other if it was ever heard at all.

So basically my beef is with the fact that the statute that governs the cost of copies for transcripts in the custody of the Medical Examiner’s Office ($5 per page) are directly at odds with the Illinios Freedom of Information Act. (There is a loophole in the Illinois FOIA that states in 5 ILCS 140/6  Sec 6 (b<i>).. Except when a fee is otherwise fixed by statute)</i>

You can read both for yourselves here:

<a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=85" target="_blank">Illinois Freedom of Information Act</a> (scroll down to section 6 which covers fees)

<a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=096-1161" target="_blank">State of Illinois, Public Act 096</a> (which covers ridiculous fees for public documents)

So forgive me if I don’t applaud the fact that the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office found historical documents that they are responsible for finding and preserving and just in time for Valentines Day!

But if you do want to read the article on their stupendous job you can read it<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3444390/Autopsy-reports-1929-Valentines-Day-massacre.html " target="_blank"> here</a>

People also find fascination with the topic of witches and witchcraft.  There are also very different ways of looking at what the term witch or witchcraft actually denotes.

Some people think of a witch as an evil, old, hag of a woman who eats children such as in the folk tale of Hansel and Gretel or flies on a broom stick, casts spells and hates young girls from Kansas and their little dogs too.

Others see witches as the peaceful, nature-loving followers of the Wicca religion.  In fact, according to the website <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">www.religioustolerance.org</a>,  there are at least<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pott1.htm#de" target="_blank"> 17 common meanings for witch or witchcraft.</a>

The definition that seems closest to the one that the accusers in the Salem Witch Trials used is what they deem the Gothic Satanist.  The Gothic Satanist is a worshiper of Satan who, during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, was believed to use black magic to harm others, by involving the aid of Satan and his demons.

Laws to protect the citizenry against such evil-doers were enacted and since I live in Illinois and write about Chicago and Illinois history it begged the question: Is witchcraft against the law in Illinois today?

Chicago and Illinois have had their issues with witches in the past but before that let’s start with a little Illinois history.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Illinois History</span></b>

In 1696 the Jesuit Mission de l’Ange Gardien  is founded in Chicagou by Father Pierre Francois Pinet and in March of 1699 he establishes the Mission de Sainte Famille de Caoquias at what is now Cahokia, Illinois and also when its written history begins.

On February 10, 1763, the Treaty of Paris is signed following Great Britain’s victory in the French and Indian War and the area falls under British rule.

During the Revolutionary War, General George Rogers Clark of Virginia and nearly 175 of his men took the towns of Kaskaskia, Cahokia and Vincennes from the British in July of 1778 without firing a shot.  It seemed that the French and Indians who occupied these areas were not keen on taking up arms for the British.   By December 9th of that year, Virginia claimed the “Illinois Country” and it became the County of Illinois, Virginia.  I found it interesting that our great State of Illinois was the largest county in Virginia for five years!

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Witch Executions on Illinois Soil</span></b>

There are numerous references to at least two executions of witches on Illinois soil while it was still part of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Both cases take place near the town of Cahokia, Illinois which in 1779 was in the Kaskaskia District of Virginia.

The first involves an African slave by the name of Moreau.  Moreau was brought to Cahokia [Kohos] from New Orleans by a Frenchman who soon abandoned him there.  The residents assumed he was given his freedom by his master.  He acquired a small parcel of land and began to raise pigs.  A sickness that affected the swine in the area killed off most of the pigs except for Moreau’s and he was quickly accused of witchcraft in that he either was able to protect his pigs from a natural disease through use of witchcraft or caused the deaths of the other pigs in the same manner.

They also surmised that rather than being left a free man, he must have killed his owner by use of magic [“by the power of his devilish incantations”] and disposed of his body.

He was arrested, tried and convicted of witchcraft and hung on a tree a short distance southeast of Cahokia.  Of course the reason that his mistress was still alive was because she was too powerful for his magic.

The second case takes place in the same place, and maybe not so coincidentally, at roughly the same time.  A slave named Emmanuel was shot to death in the street at Cahokia for witchcraft shortly after the order came down from the Court of Kaskaskia to have him burned to death.

Both accounts are verified by letters from John Todd who was appointed the Lieutenant or Commandant of the County of Illinois in the Commonwealth of Virginia in a letter written by Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia on the 12<sup>th</sup> of December 1778.

The letters were in the Record Book of John Todd and state:

&nbsp;

<b>[John Todd to Richard Winston]</b>

WARRANT FOR EXECUTION: [erased, page 18]

<em>Illinois, to wit:  To Richard Winston, Esq., Sheriff in Chief of the District of Kaskaskia:</em>

<em>                Negro Manuel, a Slave, in your Custody, is condemned by the Court of Kaskaskia, after having made honorable Fine at the Door of the Church, to be chained to a post at the water side &amp; there to be burnt alive, &amp; his ashes scattered, as appears to me by Record.  This Sentence you are hereby required to put in Execution on Tuesday next, at 9 o’Clock in the morning; and this shall be your Warrant.  Given under my hand &amp; seal at Kaskaskia the 13<sup>th</sup> day of June, in the third year of the Commonwealth [1779]</em>

<b>[John Todd to Nicholas Janis, page 19:]</b>

<em>To Capt. Nicholas Janis: </em>

<em>You are hereby required to call upon a party of your Militia to guard Moreau, a Slave condemned to execution, up to the Town of Kohos [Cahokia]. Put them under an Officer.  They shall be entitled to pay, rations, &amp; refreshment during the time they shall be upon duty, to be certified hereafter by you.</em>

<em>I am, sir, your humble servant,</em>

<em>JNo Todd, 15<sup>th</sup> June 1779</em>

<em>I recommend 4 or 5 from your Compy &amp; as many from Capt. Placey’s, and consult Mr. Lacroix about the time necessary.</em>

<em>J.T.</em>

The slave Emmanuel was supposed to have been burnt alive but some accounts mention he was shot to death and then burned.  Either someone decided to take matters into their own hands before the troops arrived or they had mercy on him and shot him before burning him.  The details of that are sketchy at best.

On September 3, 1783, America and Britain signed peace articles in Paris ending the Revolutionary War and one year later Virginia ceded its claim to western territory to the United States to settle war time debts.

On July 13, 1787, Congress passed the ordinance which established the Northwest Territory and General Arthur St. Clair was appointed Governor.  Governor St. Clair travelled to the area in 1790 and in May established St. Clair County in southern Illinois.  He appointed officials and militias in both Kaskaskia and Cahokia.  The county court officials purchased the building that would later become known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Cahokia_Courthouse" target="_blank">Cahokia Courthouse in 1793</a>.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chicago Witches</span></b>

While I have not found any other instances of witches being executed in our state under the authority of government since 1779 there have been plenty of reports of citizens being bothered by pesky witches.

Even in Chicago during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century the Chicago Police had to deal with reports of witchcraft.

I found a rather entertaining article in the Chicago Tribune written in 1903.  The headline of the article read: Many Chicagoans Believe in Witches – Police Have Lots of Trouble Because of the Black Art.

The article goes on to talk about specific cases such as one where a woman was arrested upon the complaint of another woman who charged that the woman had bewitched a child.  It seemed that the woman was suspected of being a witch because she had cut a lock of hair from the child’s head and a bit of cloth from her jacket.  The woman with the aid of these ingredients purportedly recited an incantation which then caused the child’s feet to swell.

[caption id="attachment_904" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/ChicagoWitchesHeadline.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-904" alt="Chicago Believes in Witches, Chicago Daily Tribune, 1903" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/ChicagoWitchesHeadline-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> Chicago Believes in Witches, Chicago Daily Tribune, 1903[/caption]

&nbsp;

In another instance a neighborhood near the West North Avenue Police Station believed that the whole neighborhood was under the influence of a witch’s curse because their cows were dying for no apparent reason.  The way that the witch had accomplished this was to form a lump of wax into the shape of a cow.  An incantation is said over a group of pins which are then thrust into the waxen cow and then the whole cow is set before a fire to melt.  It was reported that as the wax figure melted the cow would be afflicted in the corresponding areas where the pins were inserted.

The article goes on to make the claim that police are called three or five times per week to intervene between a supposed witch and her victim.

One of the most commonly used items in the accused witch’s arsenal is a common stove poker.  In order to ruin an entire family the witch only had to lean the poker against the front door or front gate of the residence and utter the incantation, “Be Accursed”.   After a witch does this members of the entire family are affected by illness and economic disasters.

Another witch can be called in to remove the curse by removing the poker but only if done quick or carefully.  Of course if a friendly witch is not found quickly, the neighborhood police officer, at great risk to himself, can quickly remove the object.  Police officers had quite a collection of stove pokers.

I had written <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/2012/02/chicago-history-rock-music-svengoolie-pagan/" target="_blank">an article about a self-proclaimed witch who operated in the 1970s </a>at what is now the Tonic Room at 2447 N. Halsted.  His name was originally Manuel Nazario Rodriquez but he changed his name to Frederic De’Arechaga shortly before becoming the self-proclaimed witch and “Pontifus Maximus” of the Sabaean Religious Order operating out of the Halsted address under the name El-Sabarum.  The business sold occult merchandise and had a small temple in the back.  De’Arechaga left Chicago sometime after 1974 but the owner of the Tonic Room still has a ceremonial dagger that was found in a window well during renovations.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Short History of Illinois Law</span></b>

Illinois became a state on December 3, 1818 and and the laws of its First General Assembly appeared in the 1819 Session Laws. From 1819 through 1826 Illinois Acts appeared only in Session Laws in the chronological order of their enactment.

In 1827 the Fifth General Assembly enacted The Revised Code of Laws of Illinois, In 1833, the Revised Laws of Illinois, in 1845, the Revised Statutes of the State of Illinois and in 1874 was the last official statutory compilation.

From 1877 to 1981 there were only unofficial revised statutes.  In the 1980s there was a copyright dispute and finally in September of 1992 the General Assembly passed House Bill 3810, which became Public Act 87-1005, which directed the Illinois Legislative Review Board to maintain the compilation of the official statutes of the State of Illinois thereby placing it into the public domain under the name Illinois Compiled Statutes or ILCS.

In the older Illinois Revised Statutes there existed Chapter 28 which was approved on March 5, 1874 and which was entitled, “Common Law – An Act to revise the law in relation to the common law” It states:

“Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, That the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">common law of England</span></b>, so far as the same is applicable and of a general nature and all statutes or acts of the British parliament made in aid of, and to supply the defects of the common law, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prior to the fourth year of James the First</span></b>, excepting the second section of the sixth chapter of 43<sup>rd</sup> Elizabeth, the eight chapter of 13<sup>th</sup> Elizabeth, and ninth chapter of 37<sup>th</sup> Henry Eighth, and which are of a general nature and not local to that kingdom, shall be the rule of decision, and <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall be considered as of full force until repealed by legislative authority.</span></b>

Basically it states that the State of Illinois recognizes the Common Law of England as law as long as it was enacted prior to the fourth year of James I (1607) and was not repealed by the Illinois Legislature.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Witchcraft Laws in England</span></b>

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1542</b> was an act passed by King Henry the VIII in the 33<sup>rd</sup> year of his reign.  It made practicing witchcraft a felony punishable by death.  It was considered a felony without the benefit of clergy which meant that you could not be spared by the death penalty by simply reading a passage from the Bible.  It would also result in all of the persons property being seized.  The act read:

It shall be felony to practice, or cause to be practiced conjuration, witchcraft, enchantment or sorcery, to get money or to consume any person in his body, members or goods or to provoke any person to unlawful love; or for the despite of Christ or Lucre of money, to pull down any cross; or to declare where goods stolen be.

The act was later repealed by Henry’s son Edward VI in 1547.

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1563</b> was passed in the 5th year of Elizabeth I and only made witchcraft a felony if it resulted in the bodily harm of an individual would the person be put to death.  Lesser offenses were punishable by a term of imprisonment.  The act provided that anyone who should “use, practice, or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charm or sorcery, whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroyed”, was guilty of a felony without benefit of clergy and was to be put to death.

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1604 </b>was passed in the first year of James I and broadened the Elizabethan Act to include dealing with evil and wicked spirits.  The act was called An Act against conjuration, witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits.  The act provided that “The penalty for practicing of invocation or conjuration &amp; conjuration or invocation, whereby any person is killed or lamed.  Declaring by witchcraft, where anything is hidden, procuring unlawful love.  The second offense is a felony.  No forfeiture of dower or inheritance.  Trial of a peer of the realm.

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1735</b> was passed during the 9<sup>th</sup> year of George II and basically turned the crime of witchcraft from a felony punishable by death to a crime of fraud punishable by fines and imprisonment.  It repealed all previous Witchcraft acts and stated:

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is Witchcraft Illegal in Illinois?</span></b>

So is the practice of witchcraft as defined by 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century brits illegal in the current State of Illinois?  I would have to say yes.

Unbelievably, the current Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) still contains the words of Chapter 28 of the 1874 version of the Revised Statutes!

While the Common Law Chapter 28 doesn’t exist anymore you will find it in General Provisions 5 ILCS 50 and it is still called the Common Law Act.

It reads exactly the same in that Section 1 states:

That the common law of England, so far as the same is applicable and of a general nature, and all statutes or acts of the British parliament made in aid of, and to supply the defects of the common law, prior to the fourth year of James I, excepting the second section of the sixth chapter of 43<sup>rd</sup> Elizabeth, the eighth chapter of the 13<sup>th</sup> Elizabeth, and ningth chapter of 37<sup>th</sup> Henry Eighth, and which are of a general nature and not local to that kingdom, shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered as of full force until repealed by legislative authority.  (Source: R.S. 1874, p. 269)

If you recall as noted previously the Witchcraft Act of 1604 was enacted prior to the fourth year of James I (1607) and is of a general nature and not local to that kingdom.  It also has never been repealed by the Illinois Legislature because the State of Illinois has never had a witchcraft law of its own in order to invalidate or repeal the Common Law Witchcraft Act of 1604 which was the same law that was used to execute 20 persons during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></b>

So while the practice of witchcraft may technically be illegal in Illinois due to an overlooked English law from 1604, I am not advocating for an Illinois witch hunt.   I will say though that there are quite a good many charlatans who sell themselves out to vulnerable people as “mediums” or try to tell people that they are able to speak to dead relatives and for a fee can tell you that they are in a great place and that you shouldn’t be worried.

These con artists are some of the lowest of the low and benefit financially from the misery and hope of others.  They also exist in an environment that is friendly to them in the State of Illinois because as long as they place the words “For Entertainment Purposes Only” somewhere in their sales literature (Believe me it is probably not on the front page of their web sites in bold letters) they are safe from prosecution because they are only doing it for entertainment right?

Maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing to pass a law in Illinois that would repeal the Witchcraft Act of 1604 (I don’t like the smell of burning flesh anyway)and pass something similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_Mediums_Act_1951" target="_blank">Fraudulent Mediums Act </a>that would protect people from these bottom feeders.

But if we don’t repeal the 1604 Act then at least the culprits don’t have to worry about being burned at the stake, hung from a tree or stoned because our former Governor, George Ryan, repealed the death penalty in Illinois back in 2011.

People also find fascination with the topic of witches and witchcraft.  There are also very different ways of looking at what the term witch or witchcraft actually denotes.

Some people think of a witch as an evil, old, hag of a woman who eats children such as in the folk tale of Hansel and Gretel or flies on a broom stick, casts spells and hates young girls from Kansas and their little dogs too.

Others see witches as the peaceful, nature-loving followers of the Wicca religion.  In fact, according to the website <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org">www.religioustolerance.org</a>,  there are at least<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pott1.htm#de" target="_blank"> 17 common meanings for witch or witchcraft.</a>

The definition that seems closest to the one that the accusers in the Salem Witch Trials used is what they deem the Gothic Satanist.  The Gothic Satanist is a worshiper of Satan who, during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, was believed to use black magic to harm others, by involving the aid of Satan and his demons.

Laws to protect the citizenry against such evil-doers were enacted and since I live in Illinois and write about Chicago and Illinois history it begged the question: Is witchcraft against the law in Illinois today?

Chicago and Illinois have had their issues with witches in the past but before that let’s start with a little Illinois history.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Illinois History</span></b>

In 1696 the Jesuit Mission de l’Ange Gardien  is founded in Chicagou by Father Pierre Francois Pinet and in March of 1699 he establishes the Mission de Sainte Famille de Caoquias at what is now Cahokia, Illinois and also when its written history begins.

On February 10, 1763, the Treaty of Paris is signed following Great Britain’s victory in the French and Indian War and the area falls under British rule.

During the Revolutionary War, General George Rogers Clark of Virginia and nearly 175 of his men took the towns of Kaskaskia, Cahokia and Vincennes from the British in July of 1778 without firing a shot.  It seemed that the French and Indians who occupied these areas were not keen on taking up arms for the British.   By December 9th of that year, Virginia claimed the “Illinois Country” and it became the County of Illinois, Virginia.  I found it interesting that our great State of Illinois was the largest county in Virginia for five years!

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Witch Executions on Illinois Soil</span></b>

There are numerous references to at least two executions of witches on Illinois soil while it was still part of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Both cases take place near the town of Cahokia, Illinois which in 1779 was in the Kaskaskia District of Virginia.

The first involves an African slave by the name of Moreau.  Moreau was brought to Cahokia [Kohos] from New Orleans by a Frenchman who soon abandoned him there.  The residents assumed he was given his freedom by his master.  He acquired a small parcel of land and began to raise pigs.  A sickness that affected the swine in the area killed off most of the pigs except for Moreau’s and he was quickly accused of witchcraft in that he either was able to protect his pigs from a natural disease through use of witchcraft or caused the deaths of the other pigs in the same manner.

They also surmised that rather than being left a free man, he must have killed his owner by use of magic [“by the power of his devilish incantations”] and disposed of his body.

He was arrested, tried and convicted of witchcraft and hung on a tree a short distance southeast of Cahokia.  Of course the reason that his mistress was still alive was because she was too powerful for his magic.

The second case takes place in the same place, and maybe not so coincidentally, at roughly the same time.  A slave named Emmanuel was shot to death in the street at Cahokia for witchcraft shortly after the order came down from the Court of Kaskaskia to have him burned to death.

Both accounts are verified by letters from John Todd who was appointed the Lieutenant or Commandant of the County of Illinois in the Commonwealth of Virginia in a letter written by Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia on the 12<sup>th</sup> of December 1778.

The letters were in the Record Book of John Todd and state:

&nbsp;

<b>[John Todd to Richard Winston]</b>

WARRANT FOR EXECUTION: [erased, page 18]

<em>Illinois, to wit:  To Richard Winston, Esq., Sheriff in Chief of the District of Kaskaskia:</em>

<em>                Negro Manuel, a Slave, in your Custody, is condemned by the Court of Kaskaskia, after having made honorable Fine at the Door of the Church, to be chained to a post at the water side &amp; there to be burnt alive, &amp; his ashes scattered, as appears to me by Record.  This Sentence you are hereby required to put in Execution on Tuesday next, at 9 o’Clock in the morning; and this shall be your Warrant.  Given under my hand &amp; seal at Kaskaskia the 13<sup>th</sup> day of June, in the third year of the Commonwealth [1779]</em>

<b>[John Todd to Nicholas Janis, page 19:]</b>

<em>To Capt. Nicholas Janis: </em>

<em>You are hereby required to call upon a party of your Militia to guard Moreau, a Slave condemned to execution, up to the Town of Kohos [Cahokia]. Put them under an Officer.  They shall be entitled to pay, rations, &amp; refreshment during the time they shall be upon duty, to be certified hereafter by you.</em>

<em>I am, sir, your humble servant,</em>

<em>JNo Todd, 15<sup>th</sup> June 1779</em>

<em>I recommend 4 or 5 from your Compy &amp; as many from Capt. Placey’s, and consult Mr. Lacroix about the time necessary.</em>

<em>J.T.</em>

The slave Emmanuel was supposed to have been burnt alive but some accounts mention he was shot to death and then burned.  Either someone decided to take matters into their own hands before the troops arrived or they had mercy on him and shot him before burning him.  The details of that are sketchy at best.

On September 3, 1783, America and Britain signed peace articles in Paris ending the Revolutionary War and one year later Virginia ceded its claim to western territory to the United States to settle war time debts.

On July 13, 1787, Congress passed the ordinance which established the Northwest Territory and General Arthur St. Clair was appointed Governor.  Governor St. Clair travelled to the area in 1790 and in May established St. Clair County in southern Illinois.  He appointed officials and militias in both Kaskaskia and Cahokia.  The county court officials purchased the building that would later become known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Cahokia_Courthouse" target="_blank">Cahokia Courthouse in 1793</a>.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chicago Witches</span></b>

While I have not found any other instances of witches being executed in our state under the authority of government since 1779 there have been plenty of reports of citizens being bothered by pesky witches.

Even in Chicago during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century the Chicago Police had to deal with reports of witchcraft.

I found a rather entertaining article in the Chicago Tribune written in 1903.  The headline of the article read: Many Chicagoans Believe in Witches – Police Have Lots of Trouble Because of the Black Art.

The article goes on to talk about specific cases such as one where a woman was arrested upon the complaint of another woman who charged that the woman had bewitched a child.  It seemed that the woman was suspected of being a witch because she had cut a lock of hair from the child’s head and a bit of cloth from her jacket.  The woman with the aid of these ingredients purportedly recited an incantation which then caused the child’s feet to swell.

[caption id="attachment_904" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/ChicagoWitchesHeadline.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-904" alt="Chicago Believes in Witches, Chicago Daily Tribune, 1903" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/ChicagoWitchesHeadline-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> Chicago Believes in Witches, Chicago Daily Tribune, 1903[/caption]

&nbsp;

In another instance a neighborhood near the West North Avenue Police Station believed that the whole neighborhood was under the influence of a witch’s curse because their cows were dying for no apparent reason.  The way that the witch had accomplished this was to form a lump of wax into the shape of a cow.  An incantation is said over a group of pins which are then thrust into the waxen cow and then the whole cow is set before a fire to melt.  It was reported that as the wax figure melted the cow would be afflicted in the corresponding areas where the pins were inserted.

The article goes on to make the claim that police are called three or five times per week to intervene between a supposed witch and her victim.

One of the most commonly used items in the accused witch’s arsenal is a common stove poker.  In order to ruin an entire family the witch only had to lean the poker against the front door or front gate of the residence and utter the incantation, “Be Accursed”.   After a witch does this members of the entire family are affected by illness and economic disasters.

Another witch can be called in to remove the curse by removing the poker but only if done quick or carefully.  Of course if a friendly witch is not found quickly, the neighborhood police officer, at great risk to himself, can quickly remove the object.  Police officers had quite a collection of stove pokers.

I had written <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/2012/02/chicago-history-rock-music-svengoolie-pagan/" target="_blank">an article about a self-proclaimed witch who operated in the 1970s </a>at what is now the Tonic Room at 2447 N. Halsted.  His name was originally Manuel Nazario Rodriquez but he changed his name to Frederic De’Arechaga shortly before becoming the self-proclaimed witch and “Pontifus Maximus” of the Sabaean Religious Order operating out of the Halsted address under the name El-Sabarum.  The business sold occult merchandise and had a small temple in the back.  De’Arechaga left Chicago sometime after 1974 but the owner of the Tonic Room still has a ceremonial dagger that was found in a window well during renovations.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Short History of Illinois Law</span></b>

Illinois became a state on December 3, 1818 and and the laws of its First General Assembly appeared in the 1819 Session Laws. From 1819 through 1826 Illinois Acts appeared only in Session Laws in the chronological order of their enactment.

In 1827 the Fifth General Assembly enacted The Revised Code of Laws of Illinois, In 1833, the Revised Laws of Illinois, in 1845, the Revised Statutes of the State of Illinois and in 1874 was the last official statutory compilation.

From 1877 to 1981 there were only unofficial revised statutes.  In the 1980s there was a copyright dispute and finally in September of 1992 the General Assembly passed House Bill 3810, which became Public Act 87-1005, which directed the Illinois Legislative Review Board to maintain the compilation of the official statutes of the State of Illinois thereby placing it into the public domain under the name Illinois Compiled Statutes or ILCS.

In the older Illinois Revised Statutes there existed Chapter 28 which was approved on March 5, 1874 and which was entitled, “Common Law – An Act to revise the law in relation to the common law” It states:

“Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, That the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">common law of England</span></b>, so far as the same is applicable and of a general nature and all statutes or acts of the British parliament made in aid of, and to supply the defects of the common law, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prior to the fourth year of James the First</span></b>, excepting the second section of the sixth chapter of 43<sup>rd</sup> Elizabeth, the eight chapter of 13<sup>th</sup> Elizabeth, and ninth chapter of 37<sup>th</sup> Henry Eighth, and which are of a general nature and not local to that kingdom, shall be the rule of decision, and <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall be considered as of full force until repealed by legislative authority.</span></b>

Basically it states that the State of Illinois recognizes the Common Law of England as law as long as it was enacted prior to the fourth year of James I (1607) and was not repealed by the Illinois Legislature.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Witchcraft Laws in England</span></b>

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1542</b> was an act passed by King Henry the VIII in the 33<sup>rd</sup> year of his reign.  It made practicing witchcraft a felony punishable by death.  It was considered a felony without the benefit of clergy which meant that you could not be spared by the death penalty by simply reading a passage from the Bible.  It would also result in all of the persons property being seized.  The act read:

It shall be felony to practice, or cause to be practiced conjuration, witchcraft, enchantment or sorcery, to get money or to consume any person in his body, members or goods or to provoke any person to unlawful love; or for the despite of Christ or Lucre of money, to pull down any cross; or to declare where goods stolen be.

The act was later repealed by Henry’s son Edward VI in 1547.

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1563</b> was passed in the 5th year of Elizabeth I and only made witchcraft a felony if it resulted in the bodily harm of an individual would the person be put to death.  Lesser offenses were punishable by a term of imprisonment.  The act provided that anyone who should “use, practice, or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charm or sorcery, whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroyed”, was guilty of a felony without benefit of clergy and was to be put to death.

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1604 </b>was passed in the first year of James I and broadened the Elizabethan Act to include dealing with evil and wicked spirits.  The act was called An Act against conjuration, witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits.  The act provided that “The penalty for practicing of invocation or conjuration &amp; conjuration or invocation, whereby any person is killed or lamed.  Declaring by witchcraft, where anything is hidden, procuring unlawful love.  The second offense is a felony.  No forfeiture of dower or inheritance.  Trial of a peer of the realm.

<b>The Witchcraft Act of 1735</b> was passed during the 9<sup>th</sup> year of George II and basically turned the crime of witchcraft from a felony punishable by death to a crime of fraud punishable by fines and imprisonment.  It repealed all previous Witchcraft acts and stated:

“And be it further enacted, that from and after the said twenty fourth day of June, no prosecution, suit or proceeding, shall be commenced or carried on against any person or persons for witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration, or for charging another with any such offense, in any court whatsoever in Great Britain.

And for the more effectual preventing and punishing any pretenses to such arts or powers as are before-mentioned whereby ignorant persons are frequently deluded and defrauded; be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any person shall, from and after the twenty fourth day of June, pretend to exercise or use any kind of witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration, or undertake to tell fortunes, or pretend from his or her skill or knowledge in any occult or crafty sciences to discover where or in what manner any goods or chattels, supposed to have been stolen or lost, may be found; every person so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted on indictment or information in that part of Great Britain called England, or on indictment or libel in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, shall for every such offense suffer imprisonment by the space of one whole year without bail or mainprize, and once in every quarter of the said year in some market town of the proper county upon the market day there stand openly on the pillory by the space of one hour, and also shall (if the court by which such judgment shall be given shall think fit) be obliged to give sureties for his or her good behavior, in such sum and for such time as the said court shall judge proper according to the circumstances of the offense, and in such case shall be further imprisoned until such sureties be given.

This act stayed in effect until replaced in 1951 with the <b>Fraudulent Mediums Act of 1951</b> which was in turn repealed on May 26, 2008 with the passing of <b>Consumer Protection Regulations</b> targeting unfair sales and marketing practices.

These con artists are some of the lowest of the low and benefit financially from the misery and hope of others.  They also exist in an environment that is friendly to them in the State of Illinois because as long as they place the words “For Entertainment Purposes Only” somewhere in their sales literature (Believe me it is probably not on the front page of their web sites in bold letters) they are safe from prosecution because they are only doing it for entertainment right?

Maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing to pass a law in Illinois that would repeal the Witchcraft Act of 1604 (I don’t like the smell of burning flesh anyway)and pass something similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_Mediums_Act_1951" target="_blank">Fraudulent Mediums Act </a>that would protect people from these bottom feeders.

But if we don’t repeal the 1604 Act then at least the culprits don’t have to worry about being burned at the stake, hung from a tree or stoned because our former Governor, George Ryan, repealed the death penalty in Illinois back in 2011.

I have always loved Barbara Bush and I have a feeling that both Democrats and Republicans feel the same way.  In fact I did get a chance to speak with her in person briefly when I was in the military and never really had the chance to thank her so maybe she may read this article.

I was in the 3rd U.S. Infantry "The Old Guard" from February 1986 until February of 1990.  Most people know it as the unit that supplies the Tomb Guards for the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery and also the Honor Guard Funeral Detail.  The unit also does many other things and because most of us had Top Secret Presidential Support Clearances we sometimes were tasked with details at the White House.

It was on a particularly hot summer day in D.C. and my squad was tasked with setting up seating and for a visiting dignitary on the south lawn of the White House.  While it wasn't the most spectacular of details it was still cool to be on the opposite side of the fence and up close to the home of America's elected leader who at the time was George Herbert Walker Bush.

[caption id="attachment_897" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/White_House.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-897" alt="South lawn of the White House where I spoke with Barbara Bush." src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/White_House-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a> South lawn of the White House where I spoke with Barbara Bush.[/caption]

Suddenly, as we were setting up, a group of four secret service agents walked out of the main door and Mrs. Bush was following behind walking the First Dog, Millie.

On the south side of the White House there is a circular walkway that leads away from the house and gets to within a hundred yards or so of the fence that people can look through as they are walking down Pennsylvania Ave.

Barbara was simply taking Millie for a walk but it was pretty cool to be there.  If I remember correctly there were two agents walking a good distance ahead of Mrs. Bush and two tagging along behind her and actually one of the guys taking up the rear was tasked to pick up the doggy doo!   It always kills me to think that here is a guy wearing a suit at the top of his career in the secret service and he is picking up doggy poop!  I always wondered how they chose the guys for that duty. (No pun intended!)

Anyhow, as Barbara made her way past the gate you could here people screaming her name and waving and she would wave back and it really excited a great many people.  Some even yelled Millie's name.

[caption id="attachment_898" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/Millie.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-898" alt="Millie, the First Dog from 1989 to 1993" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/02/Millie-300x237.jpg" width="300" height="237" /></a> Millie, the First Dog from 1989 to 1993[/caption]

So as she was finishing her walk she came right up to me and asked, "Could I ask you a question?"  Of course I was taken a little aback to say the least and while the First Lady really isn't in your chain of command in the military her husband is and you don't really want to screw up in some way.   I said, "Sure Maam!"  She smiled a little and asked, "Does this stuff ever get old?"  Her down-to-Earth manner instantly made me forget that I was talking to the First Lady and I said, "Well, it gets pretty hot sometimes having to work in the military uniform but I can't say it gets old working around the White House."  I said that these types of moments are ones that you get to tell your grandchildren someday.

She just smiled really big and asked me another question.  It was the answer to this question that I still regret to this day even though I know it was the best one I could have made at the time.  She agreed that it was hot outside and she asked if I and my guys would like to come in and have some lemonade!

She very well could have been a neighbor in AnyTown USA asking that question and she really made you feel as though she was.  The problem is that she wasn't just any neighbor and I was a young sergeant in the U.S. Army.  I so wanted to say yes!  The problem is  I was also imagining my rank falling off my sleeve when my boss asked me why we didn't get our detail done in time and I had to answer that we were busy having lemonade with the First Lady!

In retrospect I always wondered how it would have felt to drink lemonade with Mrs. Bush at the White House but unfortunately I had to turn her down.

I do know that in my time stationed near Washington D.C. everyone loved Barbara and had the utmost respect for her.  She has led an amazing life. She was engaged to Mr. Bush while he served as a fighter pilot in World War II (shot down and decorated), a congressman, Vice President, Director of Central Intelligence and as the 41st President of the United States.  They also raised some kids who didn't turn out bad either!

I have to say that I came up with the idea of the Barbara Bush run for office as I was watching the latest news coverage of the campaign and saw that Jeb Bush was bringing his brother George W. and his mother along with him on the campaign trail to lend a hand.

Seriously!  Lets look at the options on both the left and the right sides.  On the left you have Hillary who has an untold number of controversial and shady dealings in her past and Bernie who is a self-described socialist.

On the right you have The Donald, who I actually liked because of his anti-establishment attitude but now after his loss in Iowa he seems to have lost interest.  You have Ted Cruz who may have been using dirty tricks on Ben Carson in order to suck some quick votes in Iowa and Ben Carson who I wouldn't mind if I needed someone to operate on my head.  Marco I have heard speak and he actually has some great idea but may be so establishment that someone else may be pulling his strings.  I like Christie but he can't seem to get his numbers up and lets face it the other contenders can't seem to get out of the single digits.

So Mrs. Bush if you are listening and have some extra time and money on your hands I think the American people would like a sweet no-nonsense gal as our first female President and if you do win maybe you could invite us over for some lemonade.  I promise I won't stand you up this time!

The building was situated on your left as you were walking across the bridge (Now known as the Darrow Memorial Bridge) that led from the North Pond just south of the Palace of Fine Arts (currently the Museum of Science and Industry.  It would have been on your left just before you reached the Illinois State Building.

The building was approximately 94 feet square which included the porticos on the east and west of the building and the rounded 14x22 attached reception rooms for men and women on the north and south side.  The reception rooms and the east entrance that had steps all the way down to the lagoon were for the private use of the subscribers who provided the $30,000 that it cost to build it.

The outside of the building was covered with Staff and painted white which had it resemble many of the great buildings of the fair only smaller.

Solon Spencer Beman (October 4, 1853 – April 23, 1914) of Chicago was the architect and he had patterned the building after the Greek Temple known as the Erechtheion which was the last of the temples built as part of the Acropolis and finished in 402 B.C.   The Erechtheion was named after the demi-god Erechtheus, a mythical Athenian king.  It housed an ancient wooden cult statue of the goddess Athena.

On the left and right side of the east entrance there were two wreath encircled green panels.  On the left an engraved scripture read, “And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.”  On the right side it read, “Unto Adam also and his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them.”

These scriptures were supportive of their belief that the making of clothes was one of the world’s oldest trades.

The floor from the entrance to the center floor under a low dome was constructed of fine ceramic mosaic tile from Maw &amp; Co. out of Shropshire, England .  On its cream and gold colored walls there were eight mural paintings on canvas painted by Oliver Dennett Grover (January 29, 1860 – February 14, 1927).  Each mural represented a specific era in garment making history.  The first was a depiction of Adam and Eve making aprons from leaves; second, a barbarian scene; third, Egyptian; fourth, classical Greek; fifth, medieval ; sixth, Renaissance; seventh, Louis XIV to Louis XVI; and eighth, modern.

Some of the artifacts on exhibit were an oil painting entitled “The Tailor Shop” by Charles Durand and a flag carried by the merchant tailors of Boston on the occasion of General Washington’s visit to the city on October 17, 1789.

Also in 1893, the city of Branford, Connecticut was looking for donors to fund a city library and they were looking specifically for wealthy sons of Branford.

[caption id="attachment_889" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/01/James-Blackstone-Library.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-889" alt="James Blackstone Library in Branford, CT" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-strange-haunted-history/files/2016/01/James-Blackstone-Library-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> James Blackstone Library in Branford, CT[/caption]

Timothy Beach Blackstone was born in Branford and was the son of James Blackstone and Sarah Beach.   Timothy was the millionaire President of the Chicago and Alton Railroad and had been so since 1861 when it was known as the Joliet and Chicago Railroad.   His father had served in the both the Connecticut House of Representatives and the Senate and had also served in the Connecticut militia.  Timothy Beach wanted to be the sole donor and wanted to present the library as a memorial to his father.

In many respects the James Blackstone Library was very similar to the Merchant Tailors Building.  It was designed by the same architect, S.S. Beman and the same artist, O.D. Grover who provided the artwork around the dome.   The artwork consisted of eight 6’ x 9’ paintings depicting the evolution of book making.  These are entitled, "Gathering the Papyrus," "Records of the Pharaohs," "Stories from the Iliad," "Medieval Illumination," "Venetian Copper-plate Printing," "First Proof of Gutenberg Bible," "Franklin Press," and "Book Bindery, 1895."   The library opened on June 17, 1896 at a cost of upwards of $300,000.

Timothy B. Blackstone died of pneumonia on May 26, 1900 leaving an estate of over $5 million.  His wife, Isabella Norton Blackstone, wished to present a branch library to the city of Chicago as a memorial to her husband and pledged $100,000. By the time the building was completed almost four years later the cost was upwards of $250,000.

The cornerstone of the Library was laid on June 23, 1902 by Mrs. Blackstone using the same trowel by which the Chicago City Library, now the Chicago Cultural Center, was laid.  Inside a cavity in the cornerstone was placed a copper-lined box containing a complete copy of the Public Library Board proceedings, catalogs, a copy of each of the Chicago daily newspapers and magazines, and a sketch of Timothy Blackstone’s life.

The exterior of the library was constructed using Concord granite and contains 13,794 square feet of space.  The building was also designed by Chicago Architect Solon Spencer Beman, and again modeled after his Merchant Tailors Building from the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893.

The building has a Tiffany style dome with marble columns and four painted murals by Chicago artist Oliver Dennett Grover in the rotunda.  The murals have the titles of “Labor”, “Literature”, “Art”, and “Science”.

Once the library was completed it became the first permanent branch library building in the Chicago Public Library System and the only one built entirely using private funding.  Mrs. Blackstone turned the keys to the building and the deed over to the Library Board on January 8, 1904.

The library is located at the southeast corner of E. 49<sup>th</sup> Street and S. Blackstone Avenue even though the library retains its address of 4904 S. Lake Park Avenue.  The library is only 1.25 miles from the site of the original Merchant Tailors Building as the crow flies to Jackson Park and serves the Chicago Community Areas of Kenwood, Hyde Park, and Oakland.

The building was situated on your left as you were walking across the bridge (Now known as the Darrow Memorial Bridge) that led from the North Pond just south of the Palace of Fine Arts (currently the Museum of Science and Industry.  It would have been on your left just before you reached the Illinois State Building.

The building was approximately 94 feet square which included the porticos on the east and west of the building and the rounded 14x22 attached reception rooms for men and women on the north and south side.  The reception rooms and the east entrance that had steps all the way down to the lagoon were for the private use of the subscribers who provided the $30,000 that it cost to build it.

The outside of the building was covered with Staff and painted white which had it resemble many of the great buildings of the fair only smaller.

Solon Spencer Beman (October 4, 1853 – April 23, 1914) of Chicago was the architect and he had patterned the building after the Greek Temple known as the Erechtheion which was the last of the temples built as part of the Acropolis and finished in 402 B.C.   The Erechtheion was named after the demi-god Erechtheus, a mythical Athenian king.  It housed an ancient wooden cult statue of the goddess Athena.

On the left and right side of the east entrance there were two wreath encircled green panels.  On the left an engraved scripture read, “And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.”  On the right side it read, “Unto Adam also and his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them.”

These scriptures were supportive of their belief that the making of clothes was one of the world’s oldest trades.

The floor from the entrance to the center floor under a low dome was constructed of fine ceramic mosaic tile from Maw &amp; Co. out of Shropshire, England .  On its cream and gold colored walls there were eight mural paintings on canvas painted by Oliver Dennett Grover (January 29, 1860 – February 14, 1927).  Each mural represented a specific era in garment making history.  The first was a depiction of Adam and Eve making aprons from leaves; second, a barbarian scene; third, Egyptian; fourth, classical Greek; fifth, medieval ; sixth, Renaissance; seventh, Louis XIV to Louis XVI; and eighth, modern.

Some of the artifacts on exhibit were an oil painting entitled “The Tailor Shop” by Charles Durand and a flag carried by the merchant tailors of Boston on the occasion of General Washington’s visit to the city on October 17, 1789.

Also in 1893, the city of Branford, Connecticut was looking for donors to fund a city library and they were looking specifically for wealthy sons of Branford.

Timothy Beach Blackstone was born in Branford and was the son of James Blackstone and Sarah Beach.   Timothy was the millionaire President of the Chicago and Alton Railroad and had been so since 1861 when it was known as the Joliet and Chicago Railroad.   His father had served in the both the Connecticut House of Representatives and the Senate and had also served in the Connecticut militia.  Timothy Beach wanted to be the sole donor and wanted to present the library as a memorial to his father.

In many respects the James Blackstone Library was very similar to the Merchant Tailors Building.  It was designed by the same architect, S.S. Beman and the same artist, O.D. Grover who provided the artwork around the dome.   The artwork consisted of eight 6’ x 9’ paintings depicting the evolution of book making.  These are entitled, "Gathering the Papyrus," "Records of the Pharaohs," "Stories from the Iliad," "Medieval Illumination," "Venetian Copper-plate Printing," "First Proof of Gutenberg Bible," "Franklin Press," and "Book Bindery, 1895."   The library opened on June 17, 1896 at a cost of upwards of $300,000.

Timothy B. Blackstone died of pneumonia on May 26, 1900 leaving an estate of over $5 million.  His wife, Isabella Norton Blackstone, wished to present a branch library to the city of Chicago as a memorial to her husband and pledged $100,000. By the time the building was completed almost four years later the cost was upwards of $250,000.

The cornerstone of the Library was laid on June 23, 1902 by Mrs. Blackstone using the same trowel by which the Chicago City Library, now the Chicago Cultural Center, was laid.  Inside a cavity in the cornerstone was placed a copper-lined box containing a complete copy of the Public Library Board proceedings, catalogs, a copy of each of the Chicago daily newspapers and magazines, and a sketch of Timothy Blackstone’s life.

What ever happened to trying to sort out fact vs. fiction or actually having conversations about a situation instead of jumping all over people on Twitter or Facebook.  Almost always there is more to a situation than what the media chooses to inform us about.

After I heard about the Grand Jury's decision to not indict Cleveland police officers Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback in regards to the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice it was only a matter of seconds before the peanut gallery circled the wagons on both sides of the issue.

What happened to Tamir Rice was an extreme tragedy and when I thought about it it brought back two very vivid memories.  The first was when I was Tamir's age.  (In the interest of full-disclosure I am a middle aged white suburbanite.)  I grew up in Cicero, Illinois which at the time was a town of about 60,000 bordering the west side of Chicago.  It had a heavy concentration of Czech and Italian residents and of course was most famous for being Al Capone's home town.

I was about 12 years old when my parents bought me my first BB rifle.  No it wasn't a Red Ryder and no I didn't shoot my eye out but it could have been much worse.  I was a pretty good shot and always was very careful about where and how I shot the rifle.  I had set up a target range of soda cans in my yard and had even made sure that I had a metal backdrop to stop any BBs or pellets from going stray and taking out windows or the occasional cat.

The neighbor who lived across the alley from us didn't really like us much and without me knowing it had called the police. (Even though he knew who I was and what I was doing)  In his conversation with the dispatcher he simply said he wanted to report a man shooting a rifle across the alley from his house.  He even gave the police our address.

I had just finished killing some soda cans when I noticed two police cars pulling up to the front of my house with lights and sirens and two pulling into the alley.  One of the police officers kicked down our rear gate, pointed his weapon at me and yelled, "Drop the Gun!"

Now I knew full well that the rifle I was holding looked very similar to an actual high powered rifle with a scope.  In fact it was part of the reason I wanted it as a kid.  It didn't look like a toy.  Thank the Lord above that the minute the cop pointed his gun at me and yelled at me I froze and my hands simply opened without me even thinking about it and the rifle fell to the ground.  I think about what would have happened if I had lifted the rifle in an attempt to show the cops that it was only a BB Gun.  I realized even at that young age that I came very close to being shot!

Once I dropped the gun the police officer ran up to me and grabbed the rifle and quickly realized that it was a BB gun.   He let the other officers know over the radio.  My dad came out and the police explained that they broke our gate and pointed weapons at me because the gun looked so real and that the caller had simply reported a man shooting a rifle.

Eighteen years later I found myself in a police uniform and had been dispatched to a subdivision in West Chicago after a resident called the police because their neighbor's garage door was open.  The neighbors were supposed to be out of town. I waited for my backup to arrive and then the two of us walked into the garage.  I really didn't think much of it.  We had gone to many calls similar to this only to find out that a garage door opener had malfunctioned or something had been in the way of the electric eye that causes the door to reverse direction after the car pulls away.

We noticed that nothing seemed to have been disturbed in the attached garage and I tried the door leading to the house and surprisingly it was unlocked!  At that point, there could have been burglars in the house so we called dispatch to clear the channel because we had an open door.  Basically that means dispatch tells all officers to not use the radio because of the possible dangerous situation thereby giving us first priority on transmission.

I was the first through the door with my partner behind me.  The door opened to a long hallway with a "T" intersection about 20 feet again.  I shined my flashlight into the pitch dark hallway and announced in a loud voice that we were the police.  At that point I saw what looked like a rifle barrel coming around the far corner as if to point at us.  I yelled "Gun!" and pushed my partner back out of the door and into the garage in order to get out of the death trap of the hallway.

My mind was reeling and my partner was rather shocked as well.  I thought for a split second and realized that I might have been looking at a mirror at the end of the hallway and I might have seen my own reflection.  The adrenaline drained out of my body and I thought we should try this again.  This time I had my partner open the door and hold it open but not go in.  I stood off to the side as to not silhouette myself in the doorway and had my weapon drawn.  I again announced our presence and this time I could clearly see that looked like a rifle barrel again coming around the corner.  I yelled for the person to drop the weapon but they continued coming around the corner.  I stood ready to fire when the strangest thing happened!  They were banging the rifle barrel on the wall!

The barrel kept getting longer until it became clear that it was a cane held by an older man.  There was still no acknowledgement from him that he heard us but it became obvious very quickly that he was blind!

Just then a woman walked into the hallway to greet us and asked us if there was a problem.  She was blind as well.  That at least explained why there weren't any lights on.   We told her why we were there and she said that they were planning on going on vacation but the elderly man's wife had fallen ill and was taken to the hospital so the vacation was postponed.

Talk about an adrenaline roller coaster!  I had told the other guys what had happened and they more or less laughed at me and said I would have had a hard time explaining why I shot a blind guy in his own house!

So I could have been a Tamir Rice or I could have been an Officer Loehmann so I can see both sides.  Mistakes, miscommunications and perceptions can unfortunately lead to deadly consequences.

Should a 12 year old be playing in a public park with what appears to be a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol?  Most people would say no.  The officers on the other hand were not told that the suspect might be a juvenile or that the gun might be a toy and they were going to a "man with a gun call"  That may have helped but I know that as a former police officer you always assume the weapon is real if you don't want to end your shift in a body bag.  However, it would have been information that I would have wanted to have if I was the responding officer.

Did the officer driving the vehicle make a tactical mistake by driving right up next to the suspect with the gun and not giving themselves distance to assess the situation?  More than likely but I never like to armchair quarterback an officer's decision because I am not privy to what was going on at the time and I am not seeing things through their eyes.

I believe the Grand Jury made the right decision based on the totality of the circumstances to not indict the officers on criminal charges.   The family and protesters are calling for "Justice" when their is no "Justice" to be had on either side.

A mother has lost a son and a police officer has to live with the fact that he shot and killed a 12 year-old boy regardless of the legal justification.

We noticed that nothing seemed to have been disturbed in the attached garage and I tried the door leading to the house and surprisingly it was unlocked!  At that point, there could have been burglars in the house so we called dispatch to clear the channel because we had an open door.  Basically that means dispatch tells all officers to not use the radio because of the possible dangerous situation thereby giving us first priority on transmission.

I was the first through the door with my partner behind me.  The door opened to a long hallway with a "T" intersection about 20 feet again.  I shined my flashlight into the pitch dark hallway and announced in a loud voice that we were the police.  At that point I saw what looked like a rifle barrel coming around the far corner as if to point at us.  I yelled "Gun!" and pushed my partner back out of the door and into the garage in order to get out of the death trap of the hallway.

My mind was reeling and my partner was rather shocked as well.  I thought for a split second and realized that I might have been looking at a mirror at the end of the hallway and I might have seen my own reflection.  The adrenaline drained out of my body and I thought we should try this again.  This time I had my partner open the door and hold it open but not go in.  I stood off to the side as to not silhouette myself in the doorway and had my weapon drawn.  I again announced our presence and this time I could clearly see that looked like a rifle barrel again coming around the corner.  I yelled for the person to drop the weapon but they continued coming around the corner.  I stood ready to fire when the strangest thing happened!  They were banging the rifle barrel on the wall!

The barrel kept getting longer until it became clear that it was a cane held by an older man.  There was still no acknowledgement from him that he heard us but it became obvious very quickly that he was blind!

Just then a woman walked into the hallway to greet us and asked us if there was a problem.  She was blind as well.  That at least explained why there weren't any lights on.   We told her why we were there and she said that they were planning on going on vacation but the elderly man's wife had fallen ill and was taken to the hospital so the vacation was postponed.

Talk about an adrenaline roller coaster!  I had told the other guys what had happened and they more or less laughed at me and said I would have had a hard time explaining why I shot a blind guy in his own house!

So I could have been a Tamir Rice or I could have been an Officer Loehmann so I can see both sides.  Mistakes, miscommunications and perceptions can unfortunately lead to deadly consequences.

Should a 12 year old be playing in a public park with what appears to be a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol?  Most people would say no.  The officers on the other hand were not told that the suspect might be a juvenile or that the gun might be a toy and they were going to a "man with a gun call"  That may have helped but I know that as a former police officer you always assume the weapon is real if you don't want to end your shift in a body bag.  However, it would have been information that I would have wanted to have if I was the responding officer.

Did the officer driving the vehicle make a tactical mistake by driving right up next to the suspect with the gun and not giving themselves distance to assess the situation?  More than likely but I never like to armchair quarterback an officer's decision because I am not privy to what was going on at the time and I am not seeing things through their eyes.

I believe the Grand Jury made the right decision based on the totality of the circumstances to not indict the officers on criminal charges.   The family and protesters are calling for "Justice" when their is no "Justice" to be had on either side.

A mother has lost a son and a police officer has to live with the fact that he shot and killed a 12 year-old boy regardless of the legal justification.

That night their older sister Theresa and younger brother Joey went to the bus stop at Archer and 35<sup>th</sup> Street to meet them and walk them home.  They never got off the bus.  Loretta Grimes, their mother, knew something was wrong immediately.  She contacted friends, neighbors and the police but nobody knew where her girls were.  Initially the police suggested that the girls were probably out with boyfriends or had run away.  Loretta knew her girls and they had never run away and did not have a reason to run away.  They did not take a change of clothes or any extra money and had left their favorite Christmas presents at home which included a new A.M. radio.

Almost a week passed before the authorities started treating it as a missing person case.  Once they did, the leads starting pouring in from everywhere.  It seemed that every bus driver and cab driver in the city of Chicago had seen them.  Reports were actually coming in from as far away as Memphis, Tennessee. People claimed to have seen the girls at a bus station in Elvis’s home town and were probably there to visit their idol.

The case quickly gained national attention and Elvis Presley even made a radio plea for the girls to go home to their mother.  The case still holds the record for the most amount of resources expended by Cook County in a missing person case.  Surrounding suburbs assisted and a special task force was set up.

Mrs. Grimes went through hell for almost a month with letters and phone calls coming in daily.  While some were supportive there were many phone calls that were extremely cruel.  Callers said that it served her right for letting her girls go out that late or that they got what they deserved.  She had received three letters from different sources all claiming to have abducted the girls and asking for ransom money.   The FBI was called in and determined that all three were hoaxes or crackpots.

All hope for the Grimes family was lost on January 22, 1957 when a man named Leonard Prescott discovered the nude bodies of two girls on the north side of German Church Road a few hundred feet east of County Line Road in unincorporated Burr Ridge.  Their father, Joseph Grimes, who had been divorced from their mother for 11 years, made the initial identification of the girls at the scene and another family member made an additional identification at the Cook County Morgue.

The bodies were unclothed and frozen.  Suspects were interviewed, tips came in and finally the only person facing charges was a local drifter named Edward  Lee “Bennie” Bedwell who worked as a part-time dishwasher at the D&amp;L Restaurant on Madison Street.  The owners of the restaurant contacted police because they remembered Bennie and a male friend with two young women who resembled the sisters.

Bennie was arrested and interrogated for three days in a motel room owned by a Cook County Sheriff’s Deputy.  At the end of the third day he had written and signed a multi-page confession even though he didn’t know how to read or write.

Eventually the Coroner’s Inquest and autopsy reports would clear Bedwell and the fictional account portrayed in the confession.  There would never be another arrest made in the case that amounted to anything.

The funeral for the girls was held at the Wollschlager Funeral Home at 3604 S. Hoyne with Holy Mass at St. Maurice Church.  The girls were buried side by side at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery on 111<sup>th</sup> Street in Alsip.

The only cause of death determined by autopsy and coroner’s inquest was “Secondary Shock due to Low Temperatures-Cold”  In other words they froze to death.

There have been all types of theories and believe me I think I have heard them all.  Theories such as; “It was a mob hit because the mother or father may have owed them money” or “The girls’ father did it because he got one of them pregnant”

I started researching the case back in 2009 after I had left law enforcement and have spoken with many individuals who have forwarded info which in turn was forwarded to the authorities.

I started a facebook page called “Help Solve Chicago’s Grimes Sisters’ Murder” as a way for those interested in the case to share remembrances, thoughts, theories and any other stories related to the case.  As of the writing of this article there are over 800 members that consist of former and current law enforcement, friends, neighbors and even relatives of the girls.  The group has generated info that has been passed on to authorities and there have been initial talks about fund-raisers to help generate reward money to help others to come forward as well.

I had the distinct honor of meeting with a brother and sister of the girls a number of times and both I and the family believe that the case is still solvable but only with the help of the public.

For years after the murders, Loretta Grimes worked as a matron for the Cook County Jail at 26<sup>th</sup> and California. One deputy that worked with her remembered her as a very quiet woman who one day took him aside and asked him to never give up looking for her girls’ murderers.

Mrs. Grimes died on December 8, 1989 without ever knowing who was responsible for the deaths of her girls.  She was buried at Holy Sepulchre not far from her daughters.

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">My wife and I found ourselves in the lobby of the Brookfield Police Department this past Monday evening.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Like many people who visit police departments we could have thought of a million other places that we would rather be over the holidays.  I was anticipating a meeting with a Cook County State’s Attorney as the result of a domestic violence issue that had rocked our family.  We were an emotional mess to say the least.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As we sat in the small lobby with bullet proof glass separating us from the dispatcher we could hear the squawk of the radio announce another domestic violence incident that needed police officers to respond.  The dispatcher advised us that we would be waiting a bit longer because the officer we were meeting with had to be diverted to the domestic situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Our minds were reeling with thoughts about our situation and also of the situation that mind be going on with the other anonymous Brookfield family who had just called the police for help.   What is their situation?  Is anyone hurt?  How long had their family dysfunction been going on?  How would this situation affect their future and how would it affect their immediate holiday season?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">My mind then shifted gears and thought about the officers who were responding.  What was going through their minds?  Was all the recent negative media attention concerning police officers affecting them as they responded to this latest call for help?  Was the video of demonstrators in New York calling for dead cops running through their heads as they raced toward some unknown danger?  Was the latest chant, "Pigs in a blanket, Fry 'em like bacon!" running through their heads as pulled up on the scene.   A domestic situation is historically the single most dangerous call that police officers find themselves in.  Were they thinking about their families?  What was the quickest route to the people who needed emergency help in what they knew was going to be a violent, rapidly evolving mess?  What would the victim look like?  What injuries would they find?  Would they find themselves in a life or death situation?  Would they have to kill someone to protect themselves or someone else?  Would they be on the news?  Would they see their family again?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As all of this was going on, we looked to our left to the only other two people in the waiting area.  One was a young woman probably in her early twenties and the other was a very cute and very energetic blond-haired girl who couldn’t have been older than six years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Why were they here?  What was their situation? What was going through minds?  Just then the little girl asked the woman, “Mommy?  Why do some people have a bad Christmas?”  The mother just looked at the girl and very quietly answered, “Because some people make bad decisions, sweetie.”  The mother looked back at my wife and I and we exchanged looks and slight smiles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Were they there without the father for a reason?  Was he at work?  Was he in the hospital?  Was he in jail?   I was hoping that it was nothing major.  The little girl didn’t seem very affected by whatever their situation was and was asking all sorts of questions and walking around the small room looking at different signs on the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">I was starting to do the same thing.  I started looking around the room looking at different signs such as “Job Hunting?  Don’t have a DUI on your resume?” and other such things one does when one is in a waiting room.  My eyes caught what looked like framed drawing by a child.  As I got closer to it I could see that it was a large hand colored drawing with some text and many signatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Just then a police officer opened the lobby door and looked at the mother and the little girl.  He said hi to the little girl and she shrunk back onto her chair.  After all, who wouldn’t be intimidated by a guy wearing a dark blue uniform carrying a gun, handcuffs, taser, and other equipment designed to subdue or kill another human being.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Her mom smiled, looked at her daughter and asked, “Oh, so NOW you are going to be shy?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">The police officer squatted down to the girl’s level and said, “I heard that you have something that you wanted to give me.”  The little girl bent down and picked up a small brown box and opened it.  Inside was a stack of Christmas Cards!  The officer reached out and took the little girl’s hand and said, “Thank you so much.  Why don’t you and mom come with me and I’ll show you where all the police officer’s mailboxes are.”  They all walked into the hallway, the door shut and we were now all alone in the waiting room listening to the ever constant squawk of the dispatcher’s radio.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">I looked over at my wife who had tears running down her face and my eyes were welling up.  With blurry eyes I walked over to the framed picture again in order to get a chance to read it.  What I found was a prayer written and signed by some past elementary school class.</p>
<p align="center">It read:</p>
<p align="center"><i>Almighty God we pray to you</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>In Heaven up above</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Watch over our dear policemen,</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And protect them with your love.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Please guide them as they keep us</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Safe both night and day</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And hold them firmly in your care</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Should danger come their way</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Give them true strength and courage </i></p>
<p align="center"><i>as they serve till duty’s end.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>And one more thing we ask dear Lord</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Protect their families and friends.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i> </i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">I grabbed my phone and took a picture.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">So, to the little girl whose name I may never know and whose face I may never see again I simply say thank you for reminding us all that there is still good in this world.  Thank you for helping me to forget, if only for a few moments, the tragic situation that my wife and I have found ourselves in and thank you for helping us all to remember those who put their life in danger every day in order to come to the aid of people they may never meet again.</p>

The closest that you are going to get is by visiting the historic Biograph Theater at 2433 North Lincoln Avenue and attending a performance of John Logan’s<a href="http://victorygardens.org/our-season/never-the-sinner/" target="_blank"> <em>Never The Sinner</em> </a>directed by Gary Griffin.

Nathan Freudenthal Leopold (played by Japhet Balaban) and Richard Albert Loeb (played by Jordan Brodess) were too very young students at The University of Chicago.  They were sons of prominent Chicago businessmen who lived in the wealthy Hyde Park neighborhood.  Leopold was enthralled by the handsome Loeb and together they set out to commit the perfect murder.

After meticulous planning they ultimately kidnapped 14 year-old Robert “Bobby” Franks who was a cousin of Loeb’s and walking home from the Harvard School.  Franks had no reason to suspect what was about to happen and had actually played tennis recently at Loeb’s home.

Using a chisel to bludgeon young Franks and ultimately strangling him to death they burned his body with acid to avoid identification and dumped the body in a culvert near Wolf Lake.

They intended to extort $10,000 in ransom money from Franks’ family but before Frank’s father Jacob could deliver the money a construction worker discovered the body along with a pair of glasses.  Those glasses turned out to have been dropped by Leopold during the disposal of the body and led to his arrest and the arrest of his partner Loeb.

The case made national headlines and the famous trial attorney Clarence Darrow (played by Keith Kupferer) took up their defense.  Darrow’s 12 hour argument to spare the two young murderers from execution became legendary and was successful.  Both were sentenced to life in prison.  Loeb was murdered in prison in 1936 and Leopold was later paroled in 1958 and lived the rest of his life in Puerto Rico all the while still having a photo of Loeb on his wall.

I had the opportunity to get a short preview at one of the Victory Gardens Theater free public programs related to the play where the public is given a behind the scenes look at the production and discussions about different present day topics that relate to the crime and the production.

I plan on attending this Saturday’s full production and will follow up with a review that I am sure, based on my short preview, will be a powerful and thought provoking performance.

The show runs Tuesday through Fridays at 7:30pm, Saturdays at 3:00pm and 7:30pm and Sundays at 3:00pm through December 6, 2015.

You can get the full scoop on the show, the cast, order tickets and learn about public programs on their website<a href="http://victorygardens.org/our-season/never-the-sinner/" target="_blank"> HERE.</a>

After meticulous planning they ultimately kidnapped 14 year-old Robert “Bobby” Franks who was a cousin of Loeb’s and walking home from the Harvard School.  Franks had no reason to suspect what was about to happen and had actually played tennis recently at Loeb’s home.

Using a chisel to bludgeon young Franks and ultimately strangling him to death they burned his body with acid to avoid identification and dumped the body in a culvert near Wolf Lake.

They intended to extort $10,000 in ransom money from Franks’ family but before Frank’s father Jacob could deliver the money a construction worker discovered the body along with a pair of glasses.  Those glasses turned out to have been dropped by Leopold during the disposal of the body and led to his arrest and the arrest of his partner Loeb.

The case made national headlines and the famous trial attorney Clarence Darrow (played by Keith Kupferer) took up their defense.  Darrow’s 12 hour argument to spare the two young murderers from execution became legendary and was successful.  Both were sentenced to life in prison.  Loeb was murdered in prison in 1936 and Leopold was later paroled in 1958 and lived the rest of his life in Puerto Rico all the while still having a photo of Loeb on his wall.

I had the opportunity to get a short preview at one of the Victory Gardens Theater free public programs related to the play where the public is given a behind the scenes look at the production and discussions about different present day topics that relate to the crime and the production.

I plan on attending this Saturday’s full production and will follow up with a review that I am sure, based on my short preview, will be a powerful and thought provoking performance.

The show runs Tuesday through Fridays at 7:30pm, Saturdays at 3:00pm and 7:30pm and Sundays at 3:00pm through December 6, 2015.

You can get the full scoop on the show, the cast, order tickets and learn about public programs on their website<a href="http://victorygardens.org/our-season/never-the-sinner/" target="_blank"> HERE.</a>
