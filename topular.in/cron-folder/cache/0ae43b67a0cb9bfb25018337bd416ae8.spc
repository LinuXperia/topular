All celebrity testimonials of weight loss on a gluten free diet. But for the rest of us living day to day in the real world, does a gluten free diet promote weight loss?

Weight fluctuations are common in celiac patients as they adjust to the gluten free diet. Prior to going gluten free, many celiacs ate unusual quantities of food to compensate for the poor absorption of nutrients by their intestines. As their intestines heal, they continue to eat these large quantities of food only to result in weight gain. I recall shortly after my celiac disease diagnosis, my gastroenterologist advised that I should expect to gain 2-3 pounds, at most, once my intestines have started healing and my body was absorbing nutrients again. I was losing weight prior to diagnosis, and did get back those 2-3 pounds. While the numbers on the scale have remained pretty much the same in the nearly 5 years I've been gluten free, I do feel and look leaner. The inflammation is reduced and hence the overall puffiness I had pre-diagnosis.

Interesting research coming out of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center this past year points to the ups and downs of following a gluten free diet after diagnosis of Celiac Disease. As reported on <a href="http://www.celiac.com/">celiac.com</a>, researchers looked at 1018 patients with confirmed celiac disease, tracking their BMI over roughly a 3 year period. Although participants were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese in comparison to the general population, they found that <a href="http://www.celiac.com/articles/22909/1/Higher-Body-Mass-Index-and-Lower-Risk-of-Obesity-in-Celiac-Disease-Patients-on-a-Gluten-free-Diet/Page1.html">celiac patients' BMI increased over time</a> with adherence to the gluten free diet.

There are a wealth of gluten free products available on the market today, which is a bit of a mixed blessing for celiacs. Many of these gluten free items are higher in calories and lower in nutrients than their gluten containing counterparts because the gluten has been replaced with fats and sugar. One of the first gluten free bagels I tried measured half the size of a gluten filled bagel and came in at over 300 calories and 10 grams of fat.

There are ways to lose weight on a gluten free diet, but it ultimately comes down to calories in and calories out. Eating mindfully and exercising are just as important for preventing weight gain on a gluten free diet as on a traditional diet. Choosing whole foods that are naturally gluten free - think fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish and certain grains - and limiting processed foods are the way to go.

My kids love arts and crafts, but creating any art project is always a project in itself. Crayons over here, construction paper hidden there, glue sticks nowhere to be found, not to mention no really good work surface other than our kitchen table. Armed with some Rubbermaid storage bins and a desire for organization, I decided to turn a section of our garage into an arts and crafts nook.

Our garage is a bit unique - it's detached from the house but also partially finished. It has heat, drywall, and canned lighting. We've since painted the floor with epoxy paint and purchased removable foam flooring to occasionally use it as an extra play space (aka "the kid cave"). So, the basic foundation is ready to go.

With not much time (whatever I could accomplish in between the baby's naps) and no budget (whatever I could scrounge up from other areas around the house), I went to work. Here are some of the things that helped me the most and are key for creating a creative space:

<strong>1. Purge:</strong> You'd be surprised what junk you've been holding on to for 10 years. I went through stacks and stacks of old papers and junkie scraps that I was able to throw out. It freed up all of the storage bins that I used to hold the kids' crafts, so I didn't have to purchase any.

<strong>2. Containers, containers, and more containers:</strong> As my grandmother used to say, everything has its place. Each child has a bin to store their completed art work. Different media are organized into rolling stacked drawers, with everything that is needed from start to finish for an art project - brushes, rags, paper towels, canvases, you name it. Paints are in one drawer, construction paper another. Stickers get their own space as does play doh.

<strong>3. On the surface:</strong> A simple folding table from Costco works as a great craft surface that is dedicated to art. In a pinch, it folds in half and is cleared away. I purchased rolls of craft paper (doubles as holiday wrapping paper) from Home Depot and Menard's to cover the table from paint messes.

<strong>4. Label everything:</strong> I used address labels and clearly labeled each drawer for the kids, so there is no excuse for not knowing where to find supplies, as well as clean-up afterward.

<strong>5. Chalk it up:</strong> I love chalkboard paint, as you've seen it on <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/gladly-gluten-free/2012/06/diy-enchanted-childrens-garden-for-under-250/#image/1">other posts of mine</a>. We painted chalkboard paint along the bottom half of one of the walls, so the kids can always pick up some sidewalk chalk and have at it. We've even played giant tic tac toe games on the wall.

<strong>6. Re-purpose:</strong> I had some sheets of pegboard that I had painted black years ago for mounting some of my own art projects. I took them out again for mounting the kids' art. An unused sweater drying rack now serves as an art drying rack. Educational ones that you see in classrooms can run several hundred dollars, so I strung twine from each end of my drying rack to create "shelves".

<strong>7. Inspire:</strong> Every space needs a little extra color. We hung decorative tissue paper balls and a "Create Art" saying along the wall to inspire the little artists. I even hung a bunch of my old art along the opposing wall.

No sooner did I finish labeling the last bin than the kids were into the paints and canvases creating their masterpieces. When my son emerged from the garage with three posters saying "We Love Arts &amp; Crafts", I knew this project was a success.

We try and try to keep things safe for ourselves or loved ones to eat, but still we accidentally ingest gluten.Â  I've been on this diet for almost 5 years now and have done really well. This weekend, however, I was accidentally served what was supposed to be a gluten free and dairy free meal, and didn't realize until a few bites in, that it definitely was not.

My first indication is usually fatigue, similar to feeling that I am coming down with the flu. Brain fog, headache, digestive woes, skin rash, mouth ulcers and muscle twitches can also appear in the days following. Bottom line - not good.

So, what do you do? Remedies for getting through those days following a gluten ingestion are as varied as the symptoms celiacs experience. Some people swear by digestive enzymes, the BRAT diet, special teas or broths, and even hot showersÂ  or warm baths to help release the toxins. There are a few things that seem to help most people and guidelines that I usually follow:

1. Relaxation.

After the initial feelings of anger and frustration subside, I tend to beat myself up over it a bit. How could I let this happen? Why didn't I triple check things? Why didn't I just bring my own food or eat beforehand? The reality is, the damage is done and feeling anxious or upset about it doesn't change the situation. Building yourself up is most important now, not tearing yourself down. Relax and take a deep breath. This too shall pass.

2. Rest.

Extra rest, if you can get it, can help mitigate the brain fog and fatigue that often comes with accidental gluten ingestion. Your immune system has been compromised, so that extra rest can help keep it as strong as possible to prevent colds or other infections.

3. Hydration.

Water and fluids that are supportive of your digestive system (teas, broths) can help move things along and ease some of the symptoms from being glutened.

4. Nourishment.

After an incident, I revert back to blander foods for a few days. Whole foods that are anti-inflammatory (fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, certified gluten free breads/grains) are also top on my list. I also find dairy free yogurts and kefir with probiotics helpful.

I avoid eating out for a while. I don't believe anyone ever sets out to intentionally gluten someone with celiac disease, but over the years, I've also come to learn that unless that person is also living with celiac disease, they don't truly understand or care as much about the preparation of gluten free food as you do. Of course, I'd love to be proven wrong.

As far as supplements go, I continue taking my daily vitamins and probiotic. I up my probiotic for the first few days following an incident, to help restore beneficial bacteria. I used to carry digestive enzymes around in my purse and pop 1 or 2 after eating out. Once I became pregnant, I no longer took them, and for myself, couldn't tell if they helped me or not. Some celiacs swear by them though.

It's a frustrating disease. We are trying to live active, full, gluten free lives in a gluten-filled world. I try hard every day to heal my body and be healthy, but I'm not perfect. No one is. Even with the best intentions, accidents can happen. The important thing to remember is to take care of yourself today and know that you can make a fresh start with your next meal.

Do you have a tried and true remedy for feeling better after you've been "glutened"? If so, leave a comment and let me know.

I grew up dining at the iconic Berghoff restaurant and have fond memories of the pot roast, homemade rye bread, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. It was a special treat following a visit to one of Chicago's great museums or a ballet performance. So, I was happy to hear when Berghoff Cafe started offering a gluten free menu, including such traditional German favorites as their potato salad, famed mashed potatoes, and flourless chocolate cake.

I had the opportunity to talk with Carlyn last summer while she was in the design stage of her newly released gluten free cookbook for teens, "Cooking for Your Gluten-Free Teen: Every Day Foods the Whole Family will Love". This is Carlyn's third cookbook and truly is a labor of love. Carlyn's middle daughter, Sarah, has celiac disease, so the gluten free recipes in the cookbook are a collaborative effort of easy to prepare and appetizing meals for teens on the go.

Carlyn and I talked about the certified gluten free menu at Berghoff, the challenges of having a gluten free household, and her journey of writing this latest cookbook.

<strong>Gladly Gluten Free: When did you discover that your daughter had celiac disease?</strong>

Carlyn: It took about six months for Sarah's diagnosis, but she has has been gluten free and casein free for over two years. If she encounters cross-contamination with gluten, she'll be sick for 3-4 days. My daughter and I ordered take-out a while back from a local restaurant and the GF pasta she ordered ended up having a regular fettucine noodle mixed in it.

<strong>GGF: How did you introduce gluten free cooking and gluten free options on your cafe menu?</strong>

Carlyn: We trained our hourly employees, our managers, leaders and culinary staff in the preparation of gluten free foods. The NFCA has an online class as well to help educate employees. We have our managers see the gluten free order through start to finish. If one of our wait staff doesn't know the answer to a customer's question regarding gluten, we train them to get the manager. We have specific items on the menu that are labeled "Gluten Free" and ensure it is a safe place to eat. The Berghoff Cafe is certified gluten free by the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness. We don't offer dishes that aren't safe.

<strong>GGF: How do you handle concerns of cross-contamination in your own kitchen?</strong>

Carlyn: Our kitchen at home is completely gluten free. It takes so much effort to keep things that contain gluten separate from gluten free items, separate containers, cleaning things thoroughly, and the anxiety over the possibility of contaminated surfaces and cleaning items (sponges, dish towels).

<strong>GGF: What are the most dramatic changes you experienced in the way you cook?</strong>

Carlyn: It is a 3-store situation to get my shopping done, visiting stores like Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and my local grocery store in order to get what I need. I usually purchase a dozen of everything, so I have my pantry stocked. I will get as much fresh produce as I can from the local farmer's market too.

<strong>GGF: What can we look for in your new cookbook? Will some of the traditional Berghoff favorites be in the book?
</strong>

Carlyn: The cookbook has been a very big project, and I've learned a ton along the way. We conducted a survey with celiac patients to ask what were the top foods they missed the most. We wanted to incorporate those into the cookbook. We tried various products and incorporated those we liked into the recipes. I worked in tandem with a writer and recipe testers throughout the whole process, to ensure our recipes were easy to read and simple to follow. There is everything from pizza and cake recipes to snacks and grab-n-go recipes geared for teens. But, they are also a few traditional Berghoff items in the cookbook, such as gluten free rye bread and the famous creamed spinach.

You survived pregnancy, huffed and puffed through labor, and baby is here! Now what? The first three months with a newborn, commonly known as the fourth trimester, are an exciting and exhausting time filled with lots of change, both for you and the baby.

The past several weeks in our household have been a beautiful blur as we've been getting to know our new baby boy and adjust to being a party of five. Although this is my third child, it's been a while since the last two. Some things (swaddling, diaper changes) are old hat, while others (sleep deprivation) I'll never master. I thought I'd share some of my learnings over these past six weeks, along with some ways to stay on the gluten free track during these happy but a bit hazy beginnings.

<strong>Eat.Poop.Sleep. Repeat.</strong>

The Baby: It goes without saying that there's a lot of eating (every 2-3 hours), a lot of pooping (ALWAYS get a pack of diapers when you are running out to the store because you'll use 'em!), and a lot of sleeping (at unpredictable times). But, around 5-6 weeks you get an occasional smile or gurgle and coo. That lights up your world.

The Mommy: Having celiac disease, it's even more important to keep nourishing your body with healthy gluten free foods. You need to keep your energy up and promote healing during these first few months. If you are nursing, you need to keep your calories up to produce enough breastmilk for your new baby. So, be sure to remember to eat. I know that sounds funny, but trust me, it can happen. Having healthful snacks and easy to eat meals help you stay nourished while you care for baby. Some of my favorites? <a href="http://www.snydersofhanover.com/products/gluten-free-pretzels.html">Snyder's gluten free pretzels</a> with hummus, tortilla chips and guacamole, and sliced apples with peanut butter. We've been digging into our<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/gladly-gluten-free/2013/03/a-gluten-free-pregnancy-countdown-to-delivery-day/"> frozen meals</a> and making simple, but healthful gluten free meals including many I post here as<a href="http://chicagonow.com/gladlyglutenfree"> mid-week menus.</a>

Constipation is common the first few weeks as your system adjusts. Eating fiber rich foods can help, along with a stool softener (I know, not the best topic of discussion). <a href="https://www.dulcolaxusa.com/">Dulcolax</a> is free from gluten ingredients to help get you kick started. Adding flaxseed meal to your smoothies and breakfast cereals gives you another fiber boost. Van's new <a href="http://www.vansfoods.com/our-products-waffles">Ancient Grains waffles</a> are filled with fiber and make for a yummy breakfast too. <a href="http://www.schar.com/us/gluten-free-products/ciabatta/">Schar's ciabbata rolls</a> are packed with fiber and great for a mini sandwich or to accompany a big salad.

There's no way around it. You don't sleep much in the beginning. So, try and get a nap in when you can. Every parenting book says to sleep when the baby sleeps and with my first two, I never heeded that advice. Oh, just let me vacuum the carpet really quick. If I just fold that load of laundry.... I learned my lesson by this third child. Although I am writing this post as my little cherub is zonked out, I usually lay down once a day or every other day. What's that phrase? A well rested mom is a happy mom?

<strong>The Walking Uterus</strong>

Dr. Harvey Karp, author of <a href="http://www.happiestbaby.com/">The Happiest Baby </a>book series, suggests adopting the role of a walking uterus the first few months. Babies are used to constant motion in the warm, safe harbour of the womb and recreating that environment by keeping baby close to you in the initial months can help ease their transition to the outside world. We've taken many stroller walks on these recent nice days. The motion calms my little man and the fresh air, sunshine and open spaces calm my psyche.

Friends recently gave us a <a href="http://www.mobywrap.com/mw/Home.htm">Moby Wrap</a> as a baby gift, which I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about at first. Well, I've been using it all the time with Little Man. He hates the swing that his older sibs loved. With this, he snuggles in close to me in an upright position and accompanies me throughout the house, back and forth to the bus stop, wherever. He is peaceful and calm and I have hands free to write a blog post.

That's about all I have energy for right now....gotta get a nap in before the next feeding. Congrats to all you new gluten free moms out there and Happy Mother's Day!

You survived pregnancy, huffed and puffed through labor, and baby is here! Now what? The first three months with a newborn, commonly known as the fourth trimester, are an exciting and exhausting time filled with lots of change, both for you and the baby.

The past several weeks in our household have been a beautiful blur as we've been getting to know our new baby boy and adjust to being a party of five. Although this is my third child, it's been a while since the last two. Some things (swaddling, diaper changes) are old hat, while others (sleep deprivation) I'll never master. I thought I'd share some of my learnings over these past six weeks, along with some ways to stay on the gluten free track during these happy but a bit hazy beginnings.

<strong>Eat.Poop.Sleep. Repeat.</strong>

The Baby: It goes without saying that there's a lot of eating (every 2-3 hours), a lot of pooping (ALWAYS get a pack of diapers when you are running out to the store because you'll use 'em!), and a lot of sleeping (at unpredictable times). But, around 5-6 weeks you get an occasional smile or gurgle and coo. That lights up your world.

The Mommy: Having celiac disease, it's even more important to keep nourishing your body with healthy gluten free foods. You need to keep your energy up and promote healing during these first few months. If you are nursing, you need to keep your calories up to produce enough breastmilk for your new baby. So, be sure to remember to eat. I know that sounds funny, but trust me, it can happen. Having healthful snacks and easy to eat meals help you stay nourished while you care for baby.

Baby websites like <a href="ww.babycenter.com">Babycenter </a>and <a href="http://www.thebump.com/">The Bump</a> have some great to do lists to get you prepped in the final weeks before labor begins. These include finding a pediatrician for your baby, stocking newborn essentials, installing the car seat, and lining up help for after baby's arrival. If you are a gluten free mommy-to-be however, there are a few additional things to consider when packing yourÂ  hospital bag and getting things ready to go for baby's arrival. The lists below take into account my past experience as well as some great advice from girlfriends and their birthing experiences. Good luck and here's to a great delivery!

<strong>To Do's Before Baby's Arrival</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Pack Your Hospital Bag</li>
	<li>Contact Your Hospital about Allergen Free Meals</li>
	<li>TryÂ  an Online Grocery Service</li>
	<li>Make some "Freezer-Friendly" Meals</li>
	<li>Pamper Yourself</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">What to Pack in Your Hospital Bag</span>

We've had our bags packed for the past few weeks, so it figures baby is taking its time. We did have two false alarms and having that bag ready to go was certainly a stress relief. This list is by no means exhaustive, but a good starting point when thinking of what to take with you to the hospital, especially if you are gluten free. Several of my mom friends offered suggestions as well.
<ul>
	<li>Gluten Free toiletries (shampoo, toothpaste, deodorant, moisturizer, cosmetics) - hairbrush, toothbrush, rubber bands</li>
	<li>Comfortable PJs (bring a couple) and a robe or warm sweater</li>
	<li>Socks, slippers and/or flip flops</li>
	<li>Something to relax you during labor - CDs of music, pictures of your other children</li>
	<li>Electronic devices for capturing the moment - iPhone, cameras and accompanying chargers</li>
	<li>Gluten free snacks - check out my <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/gladly-gluten-free/2011/10/snack-attack-favorite-gluten-free-snacking-options-2/">gluten free</a> snack blog post. Gluten free granola bars, Crunchmaster multi-grain crisps, and pretzels travel well.</li>
	<li>Phone numbers, Email addresses for contacting family and friends with the big news</li>
	<li>Nursing bra, comfortable sports bra, nipple cream</li>
	<li>Maternity underwear (several pairs) - the mesh undies the hospital gives you are good but you'll run out quickly</li>
	<li>Yoga pants, tank tops, maternity outfit for going home - yes, you will be a smaller maternity size but don't expect to wear regular clothes home!</li>
	<li>An outfit for the baby, including socks, onesie, diaper and hat, baby blanket</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Contact Your Hospital About Allergen Free Meals</span>

Since you are going to a hospital, you'd think getting any dietary concerns you have addressed would be a given. Just to be safe though, be an advocate for yourself and contact the hospital to ensure you can get gluten free/dairy free or whatever allergen free meal service that you need during your stay. You can indicate that when you register at the hospital, but it's a good idea to let the staff know once you arrive in labor &amp; delivery as well.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Try out an Online Grocery Service</span>

My husband and I used to order groceries online quite frequently in my pre-celiac days, until I accidentally ordered and received 11 boxes of Honey Bunches of Oats cereal (I intended to order 1 but obviously fat-fingered the entry). I was pleasantly surprised to re-establish our account with <a href="http://www.peapod.com/">Peapod </a>recently and find a wide selection of gluten free and dairy free items, ranging from Udi bread and Van's waffles to Glutino breakfast bars and Silk yogurts. Peapod also has clear icon indicators for each product that is considered gluten free and dairy free. Stocking the household with groceries can be done with the click of the mouse while feeding the little one. To me, it's worth the extra cost of delivery for that convenience.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Make Some Freezer-Friendly Gluten Free Meals (Dairy free too!)</span>

Fast. Easy. Convenient. Nutritious. If you can stock your freezer with a few go-to meals before baby comes, that will be one less thing to think about. You need meals that you know are safe to eat and convenient, but are also nutritious for you and baby (if you are nursing). Here are a few meal ideas that either come from the frozen foods section or are easy to prep and freeze:
<ul>
	<li>Italian Beef Sandwiches, Baked Fries and Veggies:<a href="http://www.hormel.com/products/glutenfree.aspx"> Hormel Italian Style Beef Roast with Au Jus</a>, gluten free sandwich bun (Schar, Udi), Ore Ida golden crinkles fries,and a frozen veggie</li>
	<li>Gluten free Lasagna: Whole Foods has a great recipe I've made for <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipe/dairy-and-gluten-free-lasagna">gluten and dairy free lasagna</a>. I use tofu to make my own <a href="http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=1138&amp;catId=11">tofu ricotta cheese</a> that actually tastes like ricotta cheese too!</li>
	<li>Â Pasta Veggie Soup: This<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/gladly-gluten-free/2011/09/gluten-and-dairy-free-tuscan-bread-soup/"> veggie soup</a> is packed with nutrients, easy to make, and filling. Add a gluten free roll or a sandwich and you've got a quick dinner.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pamper Yourself</span>

Everyone says to take these last extra moments to enjoy some time for yourself because it will be hard to come by once baby arrives. I've enjoyed a few extra naps, long walks (which have proven unsuccessful to induce labor), an eyebrow wax, and catching up on some mindless television. Whatever relaxes you and makes you feel a bit better as you slug through these last uncomfortable days and weeks, do it. You'll be re-charged to birth that baby when the time comes!

<strong>Gluten Free News</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spring Flours Benefit</span>

Tickets are on sale now for The University of Chicago's Celiac Research Center's annual Spring benefit,<a href="http://www.cureceliacdisease.org/who-we-are/events/spring-flours"> Spring Flours</a>. The event will be held Friday, April 5th at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Tickets are on sale for $175 per person and will feature raffle items, live and silent auctions, and gluten free tasting stations from some of Chicago's top chefs and bakers. Some of the restaurants featured include Francesca's restaurants, Sweet Ali's Gluten Free Bakery, Cooper's Hawk Winery and Restaurants amongst many others.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gluten Free Regulation Up for Final Review</span>

According to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/regwatch/healthcare/284929-gluten-free-labeling-rules-head-to-white-house">The Hill</a>, gluten free labeling regulations that have been in the works by the FDA since 2005 have made their way to the White Houseâ€™s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) last week. The regulations will need to pass through the OIRA before they can be enacted. Having a uniform definition of "gluten free" can certainly help those of us with celiac discern products that are safe from those that may be questionable. The FDA's regulation defines a product as gluten free as "not containing the following: wheat, rye, barley, or any hybrid of these grains; ingredients such as wheat flour that have not been processed to remove gluten; or any item made up of more than 20 parts per million of gluten."

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feeding Baby Gluten to Reduce Prevalence of Celiac Disease?</span>

I find this research particularly interesting, given the little one that I have on the way. <a href="http://www.physiciansbriefing.com/Article.asp?AID=673539">Physician's Briefing</a> recently reported on Swedish research comparing 12-year olds born in 1997 to those born in 1993 showed a significantly lower incidence of celiac disease in the group born in 1997, largely due to feeding patterns during infancy. Research indicated that infants who were introduced to gluten-containing foods from 4 months of age, preferable during ongoing breastfeeding, seemed to fare better in terms of incidence of celiac disease.

<strong>Gluten Free Nibbles</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finally! A Gluten Free "Pop-Tart"</span>

Back in my twenties, I'd enjoy a Pop-Tart or two on my morning commutes in to work. The flaky crust and sugary icing was the perfect (unhealthy) accompaniment to my morning coffee. Since being gluten free and dairy free, I've tried recreating them but end up with a crumbly mess. <a href="http://www.glutino.com/our-products/snacks/bars/strawberry-toaster-pastry/">Glutino</a> just introduced a pop-tart like toaster pastry that the blogosphere is raving about. I have yet to get my hands on these morning treats, but word has it they are available at certain Whole Foods stores. The toaster pastry are gluten free and dairy free (they do contain egg) and come in strawberry and apple cinnamon varieties. <a href="http://ecoheavenllc.com/Eco-Planet/Gluten_Free_Toaster_Pastries.html">Eco-Planet</a> has been offering frosted toaster pastries as well, however I have yet to locate them in a Chicagoland retail store. Available for purchase online, they come in blueberry, strawberry, and brown sugar &amp; cinnamon varieties.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lemon Blueberry Bundt Cake</span>

As I said at the beginning of this post, I was in the mood for something "springy" so broke out the bundt pan once again for this lemony blueberry bundt cake. I was able to make it "Rachel-friendly" with just a few substitutions from an online recipe I found on<a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/best-lemon-blueberry-bundt-cake-176927"> Food.com</a>. I only used about half the amount of glaze that the original recipe called for. I found it was already very moist and pretty sweet without the glaze. This would be perfect for a spring luncheon, baby shower, or with a cup of coffee in the morning.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lemony Blueberry Bundt Cake</span>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>2 3/4 cups gluten free flour (I used 1 1/2 cup brown rice flour, 3/4 cup tapioca starch, 1/4 cup sorghum flour, 1/4 cup millet flour)</li>
	<li>Â  1 1/4 tsp guar gum</li>
	<li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1 cup (8 tbsp) Earth Balance vegan shortening</li>
	<li>1 3/4 cups sugar</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
	<li>1 tbsp lemon zest</li>
	<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk + 2 tsp apple cider vinegar (let stand 2-3 minutes)</li>
	<li>1 1/4 cups blueberries, tossed with 2 tsp cornstarch</li>
</ul>
For the Glaze:
<ul>
	<li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
	<li>1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
	<li>Â 2 tsp corn syrup (Karo brand is gluten free)</li>
</ul>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray gluten free cooking spray in Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, combine dry ingredients (gluten free flours, guar gum, salt, baking powder, and baking soda). In a large bowl, beat Earth Balance shortening until fluffy and smooth. Add sugar, beating again, and then eggs one at a time. Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Alternate adding flour mixture and almond milk, beating in between additions, until well combined (approximately 2 minutes). Fold in blueberries and pour into Bundt pan. Bake 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.For the glaze, mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl until smooth. Once cake has completely cooled, remove cake from Bundt pan and onto serving plate. Drizzle glaze over the top.

Even if we had thousands of extra square footage at our disposal, I think we'd still somehow congregate in one or two rooms 95% of the time anyway. So when Baby # 3 arrives, it will be sharing our space in the master bedroom.

Our master bedroom was in need of some personality before we knew baby was on the way, so I was excited to look for ideas and gender-neutral color schemes that could calm both the adults dwelling in the room as well as our new baby boy or girl. Time and cost were certainly key factors contributing to the update, so any updates we made needed to be done within a few weeks and stay well under $1000.

I did come across a few ideas out there on <a href="http://pinterest.com/gladlygfree/nursery-ideas-combined-bedroom-and-nursery/">Pinterest</a> for combined master bedroom/nursery spaces, as well as clever ways to bunk siblings together if need be. I've decided to share a gallery of before-and-after pics of our combined master bedroom/nurseryÂ  here as a way to offer some ideas up to those parents out there like me - trying to creatively do more with less. Included in the gallery are some easy DIY projects to personalize your little one's new space. I got the kids involved to make some handpainted wall art, as well as a unique crib mobile.

As for color scheme, I love the contrast of white, green, and chocolate brown (I love anything chocolate!). The whites are bright and clean, while the apple green and other green hues add a fresh update to the room while also remaining gender neutral for our nursery. Now, we just need our new bedroom guest to arrive!

Here are some of the key pieces you'll see in the photo gallery - all available at local retailers.

<strong>Wall Decals (Target)</strong>: While I love hand painted art work, I didn't want to hand anything heavy right above the babies crib. Target has a great selection of vinyl wall decals that you just peel and stick.

<strong>Wall Art (World Market, Homemade (by the kids), Walmart frames)</strong>: I fell in love with the floral piece above the bed. It had all the colors we used to tie the room together, but was also very calming. I flanked it with two hand painted pieces by the kids.

<strong>Pillows, Linens, Rug, Curtains: (Home Goods, Target, IKEA):</strong> It's amazing what some throw pillows and a rug can do. It helps give the room a burst of color and a cohesive look. Not only is the animal plush blanket on the bed so cozy to cuddle up with, it adds a whimsical touch to the room.

<strong>Baby Armoire</strong>: Originally housing an oversized tube TV, we opted for a flat screen mounted on the wall and are re-purposing the armoire as baby's closet. I installed a tension rod to hang baby's clothes and decorative storage boxes from IKEA for blankets, bottles, etc.

<strong>Baskets, Wicker Chest (Hobby Lobby, IKEA):</strong> When combining your master bedroom and nursery, you have to be sneaky about storage. Things need to serve a dual purpose, e.g. a table and a toy storage bin. We kept our futon in the room for "unexpected" guests (i.e. other children who are afraid of storms, feverish, etc.), but it serves as a nice area for feeding or reading to baby otherwise.

<strong>"BABY" sign (supplies from Joanne Fabrics):</strong> This project only took a few hours, but I was able to enlist the kids to help and the end result is a cute addition to the room. Simply cover thick cardboard pieces with fabric and hot glue. Mount painted letters onto the fabric squares and then string ribbon behind.

<strong>Crib Mobile (supplies from Joanne Fabrics, Hobby Lobby, concept from <a href="http://sewshesews.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/for-the-love-of-polka-dots-a-crib-mobile-tutorial/">Sew She Sews)</a></strong>: I cannot take credit for this idea. I saw it on Pinterest and fell in love with it. For each child, I have created one hand-crafted item for their nursery. For my son, it was a painted mural. For my daughter, it was a painting with her name on it. For this child, it was this handmade crib mobile. I used the same fabrics I had used for the "BABY" sign, which helped tie in the browns, greens, and whites of the bedding. It was relatively easy to make, just following the directions on her blog.

Things need to serve a dual purpose, e.g. a table and a toy storage bin. We kept our futon in the room for "unexpected" guests (i.e. other children who are afraid of storms, feverish, etc.), but it serves as a nice area for feeding or reading to baby otherwise.

<strong>"BABY" sign (supplies from Joanne Fabrics):</strong> This project only took a few hours, but I was able to enlist the kids to help and the end result is a cute addition to the room. Simply cover thick cardboard pieces with fabric and hot glue. Mount painted letters onto the fabric squares and then string ribbon behind.

<strong>Crib Mobile (supplies from Joanne Fabrics, Hobby Lobby, concept from <a href="http://sewshesews.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/for-the-love-of-polka-dots-a-crib-mobile-tutorial/">Sew She Sews)</a></strong>: I cannot take credit for this idea. I saw it on Pinterest and fell in love with it. For each child, I have created one hand-crafted item for their nursery. For my son, it was a painted mural. For my daughter, it was a painting with her name on it. For this child, it was this handmade crib mobile. I used the same fabrics I had used for the "BABY" sign, which helped tie in the browns, greens, and whites of the bedding. It was relatively easy to make, just following the directions on her blog.

Enter REAL SIMPLE DELICIOUS from Cook!, a small food company based in the San Francisco Bay area. I received a few samples of their gluten free, dairy free, and vegan soups to try last week, and honestly, each was unique and truly delicious. The best part is they are made with minimal ingredients that you can easily pronounce and come in ready-to-go pouches.

My husband, Mr. "Meat and Potatoes" as I affectionately call him, and I conducted our own lunchtime tasting of three of the <a href=" http://www.cooksf.com/t-simpleretail.aspx">REAL SIMPLE DELICIOUS</a> soups: Azteca Veggie Soup, Carrot Ginger Soup, and Thai Green Curry. Each one was very flavorful and quite filling. We initially thought we'd sample a bit of each, but ended up polishing off all three samples at lunch. My favorite? Probably the Carrot Ginger. It is not a soup I would typically make myself, and the subtle ginger flavor was just right. My husband's favorite? Probably the Thai Green Curry. We served that soup, as recommended on the package, over jasmine rice.

Nutritionally, each soup stacks up really well and is low in calories, with an 8 ounce serving of the veggie soup coming in at just over 100 calories and over 4 grams of fiber.

I admire a company that has a personal story behind it too. Nona Lim, the founder of Cook!, developed this line of REAL SIMPLE DELICIOUS soups after discovering she had an intolerance to gluten and the lack of convenient, healthy gluten-free convenience foods.

While not available yet in retail locations in the Chicagoland area, you can visit their website to download a form to request that your local grocer carry these soups.

Think you don't have time for home made Valentine's Day cards? Even though time is tight, you can still have fun crafting together and whip up these home made cards easily. We searched for clever phrases and end up with "I like the way you roll." to go with the fruit roll-ups.

The kids and I worked "assembly line" style to cut out the message, glue on construction paper hearts and tape our gluten free fruit roll-up to each child's valentine.

Here are the supplies you need:
<blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>White card stock</li>
	<li>Red construction paper</li>
	<li>Twine</li>
	<li>Hole punch</li>

Now that you've tackled the classroom parties and teacher gifts, mix up a batch of these decadent red velvet cheesecake swirl brownies to celebrate with your sweetie. I've adapted this recipe from <a href="http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2013/02/10/red-velvet-cheesecake-swirl-brownies/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a> (originally from Food Network) and modified them to be gluten free and dairy free....but you'd never know. I love when a recipe turns out that good because I usually set myself up for some bit of disappointment. For any of you keeping track of nutritional content this Valentine's Day, these brownies clock in around 200 calories per serving (yields 16 brownies).

<strong>Red Velvet Cheesecake Swirl Brownies</strong>

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/gladly-gluten-free/2013/02/gluten-free-valentines-day-sweets-and-home-made-treats-for-your-sweetheart/red_velvet_swirl_cheesecake_brownies/" rel="attachment wp-att-2069"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2069" alt="red_velvet_swirl_cheesecake_brownies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/gladly-gluten-free/files/2013/02/red_velvet_swirl_cheesecake_brownies-300x269.jpg" width="300" height="269" /></a>

Red Velvet Brownies:
<ul>
	<li>2Â  eggs</li>
	<li>1/2 cup Earth Balance vegan shortening</li>
	<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
	<li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1/4 cup Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
	<li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1 tbsp red food coloring (McCormick is gluten free)</li>
	<li>3/4 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
	<li>3/4 cup gluten free flour mixture (1/4 cup sorghum, 1/4 cup brown rice, 1/4 cup tapioca flour)<a href="http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2012/04/18/how-to-not-screw-up-your-next-recipe-measuring-101-2/">
</a></li>
	<li>3/8 tsp guar gum</li>
</ul>
Cheesecake Swirl:
<ul>
	<li>8 oz soy cream cheese (Galaxy Go Veggie! plain cream cheese)</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1 egg yolk</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
Preheat oven to 350F degrees and line a 9 x 9 baking pan with parchment paper.

For the brownies, beat the eggs in a medium bowl. Add the melted shortening, sugar, vanilla, cocoa powder, food coloring, salt and vinegar. In a separate bowl, mix together the gluten free flours and guar gum. Add the flour mixture to the wet brownie ingredients until incorporated. Pour 3/4 of the brownie batter into the parchment-lined pan.

For the cheesecake swirl, in a medium bowl, mix together (on medium speed) the dairy free cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla until smooth. Drop heaping spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture onto the brownie batter. Take remaining 1/4 of the brownie batter and pour on top. Using a knife or toothpick, swirl the cream cheese and brownie batter. Bake for 3o minutes. When done, a toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. Let cool completely before cutting and serving...or cheat like we did and try one immediately!

Teacher can sit back, enjoy a good book, and nibble on some M &amp; M's Valentine's Candies (gluten free). Like the home made cards above, this one is super easy too.

&nbsp;

Here are the supplies you need:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Black card stock</li>
	<li>White card stock</li>
	<li>Picture of your child (I made black &amp; white photo copies of a photo I liked)</li>
	<li>Red construction paper</li>
	<li>Hole Punch</li>
	<li>Twine</li>
	<li>M &amp; M's candies (red, white, pink for valentine's day)</li>
	<li>Plastic baggies</li>
</ul>

Now that you've tackled the classroom parties and teacher gifts, mix up a batch of these decadent red velvet cheesecake swirl brownies to celebrate with your sweetie. I've adapted this recipe from <a href="http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2013/02/10/red-velvet-cheesecake-swirl-brownies/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a> (originally from Food Network) and modified them to be gluten free and dairy free....but you'd never know. I love when a recipe turns out that good because I usually set myself up for some bit of disappointment. For any of you keeping track of nutritional content this Valentine's Day, these brownies clock in around 200 calories per serving (yields 16 brownies).

Red Velvet Brownies:
<ul>
	<li>2Â  eggs</li>
	<li>1/2 cup Earth Balance vegan shortening</li>
	<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
	<li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1/4 cup Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
	<li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1 tbsp red food coloring (McCormick is gluten free)</li>
	<li>3/4 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
	<li>3/4 cup gluten free flour mixture (1/4 cup sorghum, 1/4 cup brown rice, 1/4 cup tapioca flour)<a href="http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2012/04/18/how-to-not-screw-up-your-next-recipe-measuring-101-2/">
</a></li>
	<li>3/8 tsp guar gum</li>
</ul>
Cheesecake Swirl:
<ul>
	<li>8 oz soy cream cheese (Galaxy Go Veggie! plain cream cheese)</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1 egg yolk</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
Preheat oven to 350F degrees and line a 9 x 9 baking pan with parchment paper.

For the brownies, beat the eggs in a medium bowl. Add the melted shortening, sugar, vanilla, cocoa powder, food coloring, salt and vinegar. In a separate bowl, mix together the gluten free flours and guar gum. Add the flour mixture to the wet brownie ingredients until incorporated. Pour 3/4 of the brownie batter into the parchment-lined pan.

For the cheesecake swirl, in a medium bowl, mix together (on medium speed) the dairy free cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla until smooth. Drop heaping spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture onto the brownie batter. Take remaining 1/4 of the brownie batter and pour on top. Using a knife or toothpick, swirl the cream cheese and brownie batter. Bake for 3o minutes. When done, a toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. Let cool completely before cutting and serving...or cheat like we did and try one immediately!
