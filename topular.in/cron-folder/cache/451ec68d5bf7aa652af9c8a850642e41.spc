My career was here and houses were cheap at the time, so I stayed. I've made friends, started a family and have learned the culture. 

The transistion wasn't easy though. 

Holding my own in traffic was a challenge until I learned to flip the bird and stay in my lane. 

People could be downright assholes, so I had to adapt to  my order to avoid getting swallowed up and shat out. 

There's some things I never quite understood since I've been here. It could be the suburbanite in me:

#1.Peanuts Do Not Belong On Effing Sundaes!

Seriously though, who the hell do I have to get in good with to get a sundae with salted pecans?

Recently, I went to Margies Candies on the North side and asked for a caramel sundae with pecans. "Sure, we can do that" the waitress assured me.

 My mouth watered as I waited. 

To my disappointment, the pecan sundae I craved was covered in datgum peanuts! 

Not a pecan in sight. 

I nearly reenacted this scene from Hoodlum. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4i8j74Zotk&feature=youtube_gdata_player">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4i8j74Zotk&feature=youtube_gdata_player</a>

Just replace "almonds" with "peanuts" for this scene. That's how pissed I was. 

I've been to other establishments and have yet to find one parlor in six years that does it that way. 

In Joliet, that's the only way to make a hot caramel sundae: Sweet contrasted by lightly salted pecans.

#2. Mild Sauce Is Not The Cure For Cancer!

What is it with mild sauce that makes people believe that it enhances a meal? To me, seems like it covers up some taste deficiency instead.  Taste a wing from Uncle Remus without the mild sauce and you'll be disappointed.  Slather it in mild sauce and you'll be slightly less disappointed as your taste buds are trying to figure out what all that other shit is.  

Still a pretty below average wing...mild sauce or not. 

Sort of like rolling a turd in sugar..still a turd

#3.Is That A Damn Bird On Your Eyelid? 

Often enough, I've used false eyelashes to make my eyes pop. You know, subtle changes go further. 

Natural looking lashes are better.

I cannot to grasp why a lot of women here wear fake lashes that were harvested off of the backs of muskrats and want you to believe that shit is real. 

Exhibit A: This is an exaggeration, but I am sure someone from Chicago inspired her to do this:

#4. The South Side Isn't 100% Ghetto.

I get so sick of folks making snide comments about the South side of the city as though it has nothing to offer. 

There are so many jewels that give the South side a flair like no other. Bike trails, lovely beaches and parks are just for starters.  

For the record, the North side neighborhoods can be just as violent. 

You can get beat with a baseball bat in Bucktown just as quickly as you can get robbed in Woodlawn.

 Chicago is dangerous...period. Just be careful EVERYWHERE. 

Anyhow, I respect the city for it's lovely architecture and hardworking people. 

To this day, no other city can duplicate Chicago Style pizza or Maxwell Street Polish. 

 There will never be another baseball team greater than the Chicago White Sox and no other group of fans more upset than the Chicago Cubs fans over that statement. 

Chicago is great...mild sauce or not.

The challenge was initially set for 22 days as I've heard that it takes about that long to break a bad habit.

During this time, I became a pescatarian, or someone who eats fish but no other forms of meat. 

The challenge is close to the end but the weirdest thing has happened: I have no desire or craving for meat. In some ways I am disgusted by it. 

I feel guilty...like I am doing something illegal by not eating meat. My guilt lies in the fact that I am the queen of turkey and brisket during the holidays ( my recipe is top secret). Will I be letting my family down by turning my back to meat? 

My health has improved dramatically in this short timeframe and I guess I want to push the envelope by seeing how far I can go. 

My digestive issues have disappeared and I am quite regular. Furthermore, where I thought I saw a grey hair a black hair sits again. My skin looks really vibrant, my eyes appear brighter and my insides feel...well..different. 

Of course, I could be imaging this but something has definitely changed.

Now...

I am very cautious about what I put in my mouth and my refrigerator isn't full of crap that isn't good for me. I eat tons of fruit and veggies daily that I spend so much less on groceries.

I am very cautious about what I put in my mouth and my refrigerator isn't full of crap that isn't good for me. I eat tons of fruit and veggies daily that I spend so much less on groceries. 

Heck, this is a new page in my book of life. I plan to stick it out in this chapter for a while.

&nbsp;

Some years ago, for about a 14 months, I gave up meat cold tofu.  I was incredibly thin but not necessarily healthy as I really didn't do it the right way.  I ate a lot of grilled cheese sandwiches and just other variations of crap that I deemed appropriate for a vegetarian diet. 

Thinking back, my reasons for going "veggie" really did not have anything to do with animals being mistreated nor chickens being left to die.  It had more to do which me wanting to know everything I put in my body. 

 The words on most of the packaging baffled me.  Meat was being injected with water, or coloring agents, or God knows what else.

As far as pork, I haven't had a piece of pig voluntarily since high school (over 15 years).  When I say voluntarily, I am sure there are people throughout my journey who willingly and delibrately slid a piece of Miss Piggy in something that I was assured was pig-free. 

 People who aren't supportive of the change (not sure why it even matters to them) will do everything in their power to stop progress. 

 Yes, we're talking about  meat here.

  After going so long without eating it, when I do ingest pork , I become pretty sick.  We are talking vomiting, lose bowels and fever.

 Possibly, my body is just used to pork not being a part of my diet.

My decision to give up pork many years ago is not even remotely religious, it all began in my senior year Biology class.  My teacher, Mr. Houchens, provided the class with a peculiar experiment: one that provided us all with the opportunity to see the organisms or parasites that lived in meat. 

 The meats were beef, chicken and pork and they were of cooked and of raw states.  We watched our teacher fill wide bottomed bottles full of lab alcohol and then he dropped a piece of each of the meats in the liquid.

The beef and chicken, cooked and uncooked, provided little entertainment but the pork was a whole other story.  

In the time of our class period, the cooked AND uncooked pork developed tiny squiggly worm-like organisms that pushed their way out of the meat as if trying to escape.  

Granted, the cooked piece of pork produced less worm-things (I'm not a biology grad), the fact that the organisms were still present on a cooked piece of pork chop is what made me sick to my stomach.

To make matters worse, I went home after school to see that my father had freshly fried pork chops waiting for dinner.  I felt like I was telling my father the worst thing ever when I told him, "I am never eating pork again."  

Oddly, my dad was supportive. 

 My dad the king of the kitchen with his Cajun & Creole creations based on pork fat and hocks as big as your head:  modified his meals to include one portion that I could eat and a large portion for everyone else.

This time, I'm giving up meat for another reason: My family history.

 On both sides of my family, everyone, and I mean everyone has diabetes. The grand majority have died of illnesses closely associated to meat consumption (stroke, heart attack, cancer, and diabetes complications). 

No matter how you slice it (pun intended) bad food has been the killer. 

My memories fall back to my father, who passed away in 2004, recovering from an amputation due to diabetes, eating barbecue smothered ribs at Famous Dave's.

 I remember being so upset with him and wondering what it would take for him to stop destroying his arteries. I found the answer when a massive stroke rendered him incapable.

I want to be alive for my daughter's graduation and be present at her wedding.  If I continue eating bad then the odds are against me. 

I'm 33 but people are dying from food related diseases at a much younger age and now is the time to make a change.

Who knows, if I lead by example, I may inspire many others. I really can't trick myself to believe that I am missing meat, I need to understand that I am gaining so much more by choosing to cut it out of my diet. 

Sure, I may fall off the bandwagon someday but I'll never give up trying to climb back on.  That is what's important.

#4. Eat Less Meat...Or None.

A long time ago, I went a whole year without eating meat. Sounds like hell, right? WRONG! I felt absolutely awesome..my hair grew crazy fast, I could run and my eyesight was better. Crazy...but I am going to do it again but can't guarantee I won't backslide. 

#3. Organize My Time:

I have a habit of doing everything and nothing at the same damn time. My day starts out with a plan but takes several detours. In 2014, I will be time blocking. 

#2.  Facebook Less

I like Facebook but it is getting boring and redundant. Distance makes the heart grow fonder. 

#1. Save More Coin. 

I will be doing a weekly savings plan above and beyond what I do on a normal basis and just forget about it. Before I know it, I will be pleasantly surprised.

Really...

If we're talking about good ole St. Nick from Greece...he was probably not as white as Megyn Kelly assumes him to have been. His hair wasn't blonde, he was likely brown skinned with an appreciation for olive oil. Yet I digress..

If we're talking about fictional Santa Claus, then I guess he could be white, or even purple for chrissakes. Sorta like the Easter bunny who is white but has no correlation to Easter. We just keep him around to drive the economy.

Just like white Santa: Not the meaning of Christmas...but dollar signs. 

For the record, Jesus was very likely NOT blonde haired or blue eyed. If we dig further, we'll know that he probably looked more like the people who reside in the West Bank today. Of course, we aren't talking about Ashkenazi Jews that traveled to Palestine (now labeled Israel), but the original folks: The ones with the dark skin, dark eyes and dark hair. 

I guess Megyn is stating that Jesus, a Hebrew (not to be completely associated with Jewish in the religious aspect as some confuse Hebrew to be a religion..must be friends of Megyn), was a white man. If she is talking about pictures painted by those who felt he should be white, then he is. Yet, I've seen paintings of Black Jesus too..so he's black or at least Middle Eastern to me. 

If there's any consolation here, I've met several people named Jesus and they weren't white. 

Possibly, we should follow suit of the Muslim community and not try to put Jesus (Christian Messiah) in paintings. Then, he'll be whatever color we imagine him to be. I've never seen a Muslim kneeling before a picture of Muhammad (Muslim Messiah). They probably figure he looks like them so why bother? 

I guess stupidity raises questions and that is why I feel compelled to write this rambling of sorts. 

Megyn Kelly, through her own ignorance, opened up the minds of a lot of people who once thought like her: Maybe we'll see less Gerber baby actors in the Nativity events at our churches...possibly there will be an Asian Santa at this mall this year. 

Thank you very much, Megyn, from the sunburned white Jesus enduring a life of looking nothing like the people who raised him, dying in a land full of Hebrews and possibly Arabs living under Roman (Italian) occupation. 

All that matters is what YOU and I  feel Jesus and Santa looks like. From that, we can create our own tradition.

&nbsp;

Top 5 Holiday Gifts For Children That Are Free

5. Floor Time:

Growing up, I loved opening my presents on Christmas morning and can still feel the giddy excitement when I would find just one more gift hiding under the tree.  Yet, what meant more to me was remembering my parents getting on the floor with my sister and I to play with the new toys we'd just received.  What fun to enjoy that time playing CandyLand or tea time as a family.  It means more to me now than any toy I ever received as a child.

4.  Snow, Snow &amp; Snow:

I grew up with a fondnest for snow.  My sister and I would bundle up and run outside to slide our makeshift sleds down the hill.  We built snowmen and had snowball fights.  After a fun hour outside, we warmed up inside with a mug of hot cocoa and a Charlie Brown Christmas Special.  Show your children the meaning of a white Christmas.

3. Baking

A child in this day in age has been tarnished by the world of video games and tv.  Family time in the kitchen does much more for the soul than Playstation ever could.  Christmas cookie baking was a highlight of my childhood.  We all sat in the kitchen pushed into our roles in the baking "assembly line" .  We joked, laughed and tasted the results of our labor. 

2. Humility

The holidays should be a time of reflection and understanding that there are many that do not have the things we have.  By volunteering as a family at a local soup kitchen or collecting toys for children that are in need help children understand the true meaning of the holiday season.  Contact nursing homes in the area and "adopt" a resident who needs a special gift during this time of year.

1. Family

Take the time to enjoy your family during this time of year.  Visit parents or grandparents and start the tradition of sending holiday cards every year.  Let your child sign their name or draw a little picture inside.  You never know how much a small note can change so much for the person who may have needed some words of encouragement to make it through the holidays.

My list, short and sweet, means a lot and can help return the holidays to your household.  What other things do you do during the holidays that don't cost a thing?  Leave that in the comment section below and while you're at it, follow me on twitter @TheRealJoyRene or look me up on Facebook.

I hope that your holidays are filled with love and prosperity.

Yep, you're welcome!

 Minority sailors were forced to do the hardest tasks while whites were given days off of the ship.

  One time, a batch of moldy potatoes made their way into the mess trays of black seaman only. That was common in that time. 

Life was hard but for many the military meant a chance at a better life. The few dollars earned meant money was sent stateside to help my father's elderly parents and younger siblings. 

Years later, my father struggled with an elusive bullet that traveled through out his body.  

The VA Hospital couldn't prescribe anything to stop the night chills nor the numbness in his legs.   The painful limp that became his trademark still didn't qualify him for total disability.  His hands and feet stayed freezing cold and he always slept with gloves and 4 pairs of socks. 

After years of diagnostic tests, the government sent  $11 per month for each dependent (my sister and I) for just under a year.    That meant that my father had to work through the pain and did so until the day he died.  He passed away at the age of 68 with no military monetary assistance.

 A Purple Heart Recipient, my father,received his 21 gun salute after suffering for a lifetime.

My uncle, a Vietnam veteran who fought in the jungle with rain soaked boots, watched his best friend catch a bullet to the skull while VC soldiers advanced on their rally point.  

Drafted right out of a segregated high school, he was placed right in a hotbed of death in a foreign country.  The country he left didn't allow him to be viewed as an equal amongst his peers. 

 Whites viewed HIM as an enemy.  Yet my uncle  was given a gun and ordered to kill an UNKNOWN enemy: An enemy who was poor like he was.  

My uncle came home to the US being met with people who didn't agree with the war the government sent him to fight. 

 Adjusting to life was impossible.  The heavy artillery resulted in partial deafness and he remained shellshocked for over 3 decades. 

 The government didn't deem him disabled after suffering from extreme insomnia, night terrors and mental anguish.

 Furthermore, he felt as though something"chemically" was wrong. He knew that he may have been exposed to lethal elements (Agent Orange). 

My uncle was finally approved for total disability not even a year before he passed away last March at the age of 64.

My cousin, a proud Marine Vet, fought in Desert Storm and suffers from an unknown illness. This illness came after his deployment. 

 He too wonders if he may have been exposed to some sort of chemical while deployed which is now attacking his neurological
 system.

 Either way, he knows that the VA will refuse to admit that the change was related to his time in the Middle East. 

Today, he struggles to cope with a disease no one can diagnose.

Soldiers come home from war facing civilian life and some turn to alcohol or drugs to cope. Others are unable to express emotion and can become abusive to themselves or others.

This day is definitely a time to remember those who served our country. 

Yet, we need to remember those veterans that are fighting disabilities, mental and physical, that threaten any normalcy in their lives. 

We must create a plan within our government that takes better care of our vets. 

As Americans, we should fight for our soldiers as they have done for us. By refusing to acknowledge deployment related illnesses, our government has negated any action of gratitude on this very day.

Remember the soldier who still hears bullets whizzing by his ears while trying to sleep or the soldier who feels guilty that he is the only one that made it home. 

God Bless America.

1. I love the movies but enjoy them more at a cheaper price.

2. I love seeing any movies in which Robert De Niro has a key role.

I took in "The Family" at the Icon Theater on Roosevelt.  Icon is expensive but an enjoyable experience with comfortable seating.  Had it been playing in my neck of the woods, I would have watched it at the newly renovated <a href="http://www.harpertheater.com/">Harper Theater</a> in Hyde Park.  The tickets are $6 during matinee hours.  If you haven't yet gone to see <em>The Family</em>, here's why you should go:

&nbsp;

10 REASONS TO SEE <em>The Family</em> AT THE MOVIES THIS WEEK

10. Robert De Niro is in it. Playing a Good Fella. Nuff Said.

09.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays De Niro's character's wife and she looks damn good to be 55 years of age. #JEALOUS

08.  There is a healthy dose of Tommy Lee Jones who floats in and out of scenes with his normal dry humor.

07.  You'll find several reasons to poke fun at the French..if you ran out of reasons.

06.  De Niro is kicking ass at 70 (GASP) years old and looks great doing it.  He has reinvented himself (side note: What happened to Joe Pesci?)

05. Dianna Agron &amp; John D'Leo play very saucy roles as the children of a mob boss.

04. Robert De Niro watches "Goodfellas" in the movie.

03. Lots of gun play, blow-backs, explosives and other incredible noisy scenes.

02. Bullies get what they deserve on at least 4 different instances.

01. The end isn't what you expect but it leaves an open door for a possible sequel.
