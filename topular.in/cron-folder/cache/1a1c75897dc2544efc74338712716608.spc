<em>The lovely Susan, and me in a tux. No Instagram filters, that was actual lighting at this event (at Ravinia).</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve come by here you surely know that the bulk of my activity now is at <a href="http://fooditor.com">Fooditor.com</a>, but I feel like a top 10 list is a more personal thing, especially if you&#8217;re not a reviewer as I&#8217;m mostly not. So, if for no other reason than to keep SFOB alive, here&#8217;s my <em>personal</em> top 10:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/710/23772923802_d2f9b4160a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p><strong>10. Duck hot dog, The Duck Inn—</strong> When we finished the Fooditor Radio podcast, I tried to think of places we should have mentioned but didn&#8217;t. This is probably the one I feel guiltiest about (so I tried to bring it up on WGN Radio—that&#8217;s why we were talking about Bridgeport—but I got sidetracked). But it seems to be getting plenty of press anyway—a near-perfect-for-Chicago combination of old neighborhood atmosphere and well-made comfort food, especially the duck hot dog, which might be the best hot dog in a whole city of hot dogs.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/23585679850_1828235448.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p><strong>9. Dim sum, Dolo— </strong>Nobody knew where the late Josh Ozersky <a href="http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/restaurants/a38785/best-new-restaurants-2015/">got the idea</a> that there was exceptional food in an unknown joint in Chinatown&#8230; except me, <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/07/01/dolo-joins-chinatowns-dim-sum-renaissance">who wrote that</a> it had such great dim sum for the Reader.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/601/23855060096_a7efd0f4fe.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p><strong>8. </strong><strong>Mushroom dish, Arbor</strong>— The last place I need to write more words about; go to <a href="http://fooditor.com/the-most-important-restaurant-of-2015-that-youve-never-heard-of/">Fooditor</a> to find what&#8217;s so special and interesting about it, and how a coffee shop served me a dish of mostly foraged mushrooms.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/659/23798887711_cd4c9316ed.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p><strong>7. Carne asada tacos, Taqueria Traspasada (Ashland)— </strong>&#8220;Why had I never been to either version of this taqueria? Well, there are just so many to try, and it never made it to the top of the list; maybe I felt like I knew it because I had been to the Carniceria Guanajuato’s taqueria next door to the one on California. Anyway, I was looking for a new place and gave the Ashland and Chicago one, that once was Dion Antic’s late night hot dog stand with stripper pole, a try. It’s fantastic, good enough that no one should miss the two of the three La Pasaditas up the street that have closed. Really flavorful carne asada, good pastor despite the lack of a pastor cone, it’s a platonic ideal level cheap taco joint.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>6. Hellcat, GreenRiver</strong>— For not being any sort of cocktail maven, I had three exceptional cocktail experiences this year. One was finally going to The Office, twice, long after shooting video but never actually drinking there. I&#8217;ve never been to a place that was so good about asking you a few questions and divining a perfect drink for you based on the results. One was going to the insanely expensive but insanely groovy Milk Room at the Chicago Athletic Association, drinking their antique hooch in an atmosphere that&#8217;s more like meeting with your spiritual adviser than sitting at a bar. But the best of all was a single drink, the Hellcat, at GreenRiver, a masterpiece of multiple drops and tinctures and flavors made into a complex, beautifully balanced drink. Others have complained of service issues at the instantly-swamped bar—but we snagged two seats by luck right at the beginning and had a great hour right at the bar.</p>

<p><strong>5. Oxtail taco, Cantina 1910</strong>— I&#8217;m just going to have to be bummed that what seemed like the beginning of a new direction for Mexican food in Chicago got cut short after a couple of months. No telling what either side of the divorce—the chef who left or the massive restaurant with no chef—will do now, but I&#8217;ll remember the wonderful oxtail taco on its handmade tortilla, among several others. That said, Cantina 1910, good as it was, was not my favorite Mexican meal of the year&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/773/23798664601_67dc66b6f7.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Goat tacos, &#8220;Miel&#8221; popup by Jonathan Zaragoza and Charles Welch, held at Birrieria </strong><b>Zaragoza</b>— Birrieria Zaragoza is, as everyone should know by now, quite possibly the best mom-and-pop ethnic restaurant in the city, but here was son Jonathan, who&#8217;s worked around town from Sepia to Pearl&#8217;s Tavern, the new Cajun place in Edgewater, taking the family&#8217;s cuisine to another level with a popup dinner devoted to goat, from tartare to carne en su jugo. Miel dinners are not exactly open to the public, but they&#8217;re not that hard to track down and get on the list for either, so try.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5775/23254506473_27678e6f3d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p><strong>3. Milk/beef dish, Ardent/Red Light Ramen</strong>— Milwaukee&#8217;s Ardent boils down, for me, to one dish that was dazzlingly conceptual, yet likable and comforting enough that Liam, my pickiest son, talks about going back to have it again: the one that combined milk bread, butter and cheese all from the same batch of milk, plus a beef tartare with bone marrow from the same steer—raised by chef Justin Carlisle&#8217;s father. But there was so much more to this meal, including returning with my other son to cover midnight ramen <a href="http://fooditor.com/the-hottest-spot-in-milwaukee-only-serves-ramen-at-midnight/">(for Fooditor here).</a></p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/765/23798664791_5b993d8e2a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Pastas, Monteverde</strong>— You can get good enough Italian food all over Chicago, you can get pretty darn good Italian food at Eataly and a few other places, but I had one meal that reminded me of everything there is to love about Italian food—not just the comfiness of braised meats and hearty tomato sauces but also the stern Catholic simplicity of hard sheets of pasta and tartly elemental cheeses. You know it&#8217;s just going to get better and better, too.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5701/23881246915_7fae43a420.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Egg with caviar, The Blanchard</strong>— The most magical meal I had; I went in with moderate expectations—I like French food, but don&#8217;t necessarily worship it—yet one thing after another was just blissfully perfect, delicate and poised, more beautiful than I thought possible—the Audrey Hepburn of meals in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>But wait, there&#8217;s more&#8230;</strong> It&#8217;s become a thing for writers to list dozens, even hundreds of dishes, after their top 10— I can&#8217;t read a list that long, personally, so I&#8217;m going to put them in categories for easier reference. Many link to Reader pieces, because even if they weren&#8217;t top ten material, they deserved a day&#8217;s acclaim, anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5674/23855310976_4a72e89e96_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p><strong>Official Number 11:</strong> Eggplant parmigiana at Formento&#8217;s—either that, or chicken-fried pheasant at <a href="http://fooditor.com/casual-artisanal-food-is-taking-over-the-world/">Cindy&#8217;s</a></p>
<p><strong>Best restaurants where I felt you couldn&#8217;t quite eat a meal:</strong> I found this easier to forgive with (the lamented RIP) Bom Bolla which really was a bar, but it was a little frustrating that you could eat a bunch of tasty things but feel it didn&#8217;t quite add up to a meal. I find it much more frustrating at Band of Bohemia, because a couple of things were top-ten worthy—I had the best steak of the year there, and the dessert guy (forgot his name) is an instant star. But is a meal really a steak (with no accompaniments), a plate of octopus (fair) and a plate of sweetbreads (not good) plus a dessert? That sounds more like finishing off leftovers than something you set out to have in a restaurant. I&#8217;m an adult, I want to eat dinner in a civilized way—and I want Band of Bohemia to achieve its full potential, because it seems like the best opening of the fall/winter after Monteverde.</p>

<p><strong>Runners up for Italian food:</strong> Osteria Langhe, everyone (but Joe Campagna) likes it, but also what Johnny Anderes (RIP Telegraph) is doing at The Kitchen (above).</p>
<p><strong>Underrated burger of the year:</strong> Little Bad Wolf</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, but pizza that didn&#8217;t make <em>my</em> list:</strong> Side Street Saloon. But cool bar anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Best half a restaurant:</strong> DeQuay. I liked the Dutch dishes a lot. The Indonesian ones? Well, there&#8217;s this place called Devon Avenue where they make complex curries&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Hippest places I ate in 2015:</strong> Fulton Market Kitchen; runner up, CC Fern</p>
<p><strong>Unhippest place I ate in 2015:</strong> Took son to Joy Yee on Irving Park, and actually thought it was pretty good</p>

<p><strong>Out of Town RIP:</strong> The Magpie, Richmond VA. I will remember that summer tomato custard.</p>
<p><strong>Thing I Didn&#8217;t Worry About:</strong> What Mast Brothers chocolate says about us</p>
<p><strong>Other things that I liked this year:</strong></p>

<p>But there are plenty of places I didn&#8217;t have a reason to write about, let alone write about at the <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/bestbites/todd-kliman-otherwise/the-principle-for-dining-out-never-eat-a-bad-meal-again.php">absurd length some critics can get up to.</a> Instead, I want to jot down some notes while I still have memories of these places, and everything will be <em>short</em>, a few lines at most. Here goes; everything was paid for by me and I was unknown to them, unless I say otherwise:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/299/19459745566_8f92263599.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5124_2"></p>
<p><strong>Rural Society.</strong> Very nice quality of meat (though I don&#8217;t like it when places slice it for me, it gets cold), interesting South American sides. Expensive. I was impressed by the sleek steampunk-meets-whaling ship design. Yet something bugged me as I ate the six potato crispy things, hand-carved into a shape sort of like the grill on a 50s Packard: the feeling that this restaurant really isn&#8217;t for us Chicagoans. Located in a chic hotel, it&#8217;s so firmly concepted to wow tourists that you know that 3 years from now, the menu won&#8217;t have changed a jot— just like the same group&#8217;s Mercat a la Planxa; the restaurant doesn&#8217;t need to change when the clientele is constantly coming in and out.</p>

<p><strong>Boeufhaus.</strong> <em>Stop cutting my meat for me!</em> That said, here&#8217;s a restaurant that&#8217;s not aiming for an out of town crowd, it&#8217;s a genuine and unmistakable neighborhood steakhouse, and good for them. I enjoyed the steak but as is usually the case in steakhouses, I can only care so much about beef, rarely enough to justify $50 dropped on it. I really liked a simple bowl of impeccable farmer&#8217;s market vegetables to dip in Green Goddess dressing, and my son and I both agreed that the best thing was a terrific rye spaetzle— $7, if I recall correctly.</p>

<p><strong>The Pump Room.</strong> Went here on the house, was generally pleased. There&#8217;s nothing very daring on the menu, it&#8217;s pretty much a perfect 2015 menu (I named the fish in order for my wife without looking, and correctly predicted a ramp-based pasta—it was April), but it was all very well executed and the room is chic and lively. It felt very big city, going here where movie stars (and my wife&#8217;s mom) had gone long ago. A happy night in a place I had looked down on a little before as just for tourists; yeah, tourists like the ones I posed next to downstairs, in old Life magazines.</p>

<p><strong>The Office.</strong> It&#8217;s funny that I had shot video twice at The Office but never gone there, then wound up going to Next/The Aviary&#8217;s exclusive basement speakeasy twice in a month (once on my own dime, once for a party thrown by Sprig there). All this time I was never sure if I&#8217;d think it was fantastic or ridiculous, I think The Aviary is kind of both and that&#8217;s its charm, but put me mostly on the fantastic side. I wouldn&#8217;t eat dinner there—it would cost a billion and mostly be lush, fatty snacks (though the tartare is stellar and the taste of Next&#8217;s Spanish menu jamon was sublime)—but the craftsmanship of the cocktails to your individual tastes is peerless, and the clubbiness of the small room, which I thought I might find obnoxious, is actually quite wonderful, not snooty (once you&#8217;re in, anyway) but intimate and cozy, a perfect hangout feel with no sports TVs or obnoxious bros. If you&#8217;re going to burn money drinking somewhere, this really is a special, only in Chicago place.</p>

<p><strong>Punch House.</strong> But if you want something that&#8217;s kind of intimate like The Office, but not as expensive or exclusive, and has more of the feel of a Wisconsin supper club than the Harvard Club, check out the lower level of Dusek&#8217;s, for one thing if only because they&#8217;re among the ever-dwindling number of bars without TVs. (Punch House instead wittily has a fish tank, which emits a similar blue light.) I went (on the house) for their fondue menu; like popcorn at the movies, fondue never quite strikes me as a fully balanced meal, but their combination of crudités, bread and housemade sausages to dip was thoroughly enjoyable, and after having made punch a few times myself out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charleston-Receipts-Junior-League/dp/0960785426/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1437528634&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=charleston+receipts">Charleston Receipts</a>, it was fun to taste a few of their versions (a well-balanced older one, a modern one with too-strong pepper).</p>

<p><strong>Seven Lions.</strong> I was a fan of Chris Curren, especially at Stout Barrel House, so I was eager to try the new Alpana Singh et al. place under his direction on Michigan Avenue (I went with Nick Urig, who has since moved on from Isabelli; and Ms. Singh stopped by to chat at one point). I was happy throughout the appetizer/small plates part of the meal, with things that reminded me of dishes like Curren&#8217;s great dill pickle salad at Stout, but the main courses reminded us a little too forcefully that this was a big restaurant for the tourist and convention visitor crowd— hunks of meat which were kind of staid for us Chicagoans, however much they may be right up the alley of the hotel guest. The best one was the burger, which was a dead on perfect imitation of Au Cheval&#8217;s celebrated imitation of a Top Notch Beefburger. Next time they tell you it&#8217;ll be three hours to eat at Au Cheval, take a cab to Michigan Avenue instead.</p>

<p><strong>Luella&#8217;s Southern Kitchen.</strong> The best intersection for chicken and waffles in the city has to be Lincoln and Wilson, with Fork on one side and this southern-Louisiana place on the other. The neighborhood instantly loved it; I like it but find some of the dishes are more refined than funky for this kind of food, with the kind of plating where you can tell that the chef used to work in a hotel (like the beets dish above). I&#8217;d be fine with less fanciness and more soul.</p>

<p><strong>Ramen Shinchan.</strong> Another ramen place up in the northwest burbs, not too far from all those other ramen places. We&#8217;ve come a long way with ramen that I can decide this one— a thoroughly respectable, authentically run place— is pretty good, but others are better. It&#8217;ll be great when Ramen Misoya comes to the city.</p>

<p><strong>Assi International Center.</strong> An Asian mall up on Milwaukee in Niles; I&#8217;d seen it forever but never thought to check out the food court until recently, one day when my older son was off school. I had some very nice fried chicken, he had pretty good bulgogi, and we enjoyed checking it out, seeing the machine that made little walnut cakes and so on. A little dowdier than H Mart or Mitsuwa, but we did some good shopping and it definitely has the best assortment of free CDs from Korean Christian churches in the area.</p>

<p><strong>Izakaya Mita.</strong> A certain Japanese-influenced chef I had dinner with slammed this Wicker Park izakaya as sloppy and not very good. Me, I enjoyed it well enough. Nothing I had was stellar, but it reminded me of the old LTH days of finding ethnic restaurants (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/why-everyone-should-stop-calling-immigrant-food-ethnic/2015/07/20/07927100-266f-11e5-b77f-eb13a215f593_story.html">oh no I used that word</a>) and just being glad they were there at all and we could try different things, better or not.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/437/19479426172_58b3a15584.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2023"></p>
<p><strong>Bascule.</strong> The chef has changed at this wine bar since I went, but owners Jason Prah and Scott Harney are the key figures here anyway, as long as the food is comfy and goes with wine, it&#8217;s secondary. They have eclectic wines at not too high a markup and tell you a story to go with them. They could even stand to push the story harder; a few times they seemed a little tentative. Nah, just sell the hell out of me, I&#8217;ll buy it.</p>

<p><strong>Bom Bolla.</strong> Vermouth spigot by the glass. You&#8217;re gonna see that everywhere, loved it. <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/06/25/an-important-lesson-about-dining-at-bom-bolla-in-wicker-park">I wrote about going once</a> at the Reader, returned a second time for more things like a real meal and not the snacks I inadvertently made a meal out of the first time. I still am slightly conflicted in that I feel like their tapas don&#8217;t quite add up to a full meal. Anyway, it still seems drink-first, where Vera is (slightly) food first and MFK definitely is, even though the eaty things are all so well prepared (and it seems sure to make my year-end list).</p>

<p><strong>Formento&#8217;s.</strong> I liked a preview for this place, two friends of mine, independently, found once it opened that things were overdone to the point of being a disaster. I stayed away until I was invited for lunch on the house and if Formento&#8217;s lost its way at some point, it seems to have found it again, things were restrained and well crafted. This pasta was pure spring green, delightful, eggplant parmesan was a terrific example, though the Nonna&#8217;s meatballs everybody has to have these days were missing a little oomph to stand out. </p>

<p><strong>Frank Meets Patty vs. Hot &#8220;G&#8221; Dogs.</strong> Inheritor of the Hot Doug&#8217;s space, vs. the former staff carrying on the recipes. Neither quite has the Hot Dog&#8217;s magic; Frank does perfectly decent dogs, but you feel the absence of the more unusual choices— and of the crowds; it&#8217;s a little melancholy, at least till memory fades a bit. (Ironically, it&#8217;s owned by the son of <em>another</em> dog stand star— the late Phil of Fatso&#8217;s Last Stand.) Hot G has the unusual dogs, and they&#8217;re fine, but it isn&#8217;t the tight ship Doug ran (Doug would never have let a female staffer/somebody&#8217;s girlfriend stand behind the counter checking her phone as the line waited). You can&#8217;t go home for elk sausage again.</p>

<p><strong>Q-BBQ.</strong> Sula usually trashes new BBQ places and I&#8217;m usually more forgiving, but for once I&#8217;m totally in agreement. I tried this place, which started in Wheaton and is now also in Lakeview, <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-chicago-bbq-joints-2015">for this piece</a>, and it never stood a chance. The meats were potentially okay if not stellar, but they were doomed by way, way, <em>way</em> too sweet sauces and everything. Yuck.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/282/18863296524_6ffbc4270d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1791"></p>
<p><strong>Mysore Woodlands.</strong> Felt like no-pressure, no-thinking Indian, but Indian Garden on Devon is gone (once, that would have been some news at LTHForum; buffets are a mixed bag, but Indian Garden has always been very reliable). So I went next door for vegetarian. It was good, but it was also at least twice as expensive as just as good vegetarian at Annapurna. No reason I could see to spend so much more.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/397/19435937569_2212a63204.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2244"></p>
<p><strong>El Carrito.</strong> This is a Chipotle-sharp looking new local Mexican spot in the not-exactly-overabundant-with-tacos region around Lincoln and Peterson. For some reason I was in the mood for a burrito over the usual, and usually well-advised, choice of tacos. The grilled meat was in big chunks and tasty, but the salsa was too sweet, which is a worrisome sign of pandering to the gringos. Still, a promising-looking spot, worth exploring further.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/367/19435937519_120aae375e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2276"></p>
<p><strong>Taqueria Traspasada.</strong> Why had I never been to either version of this taqueria? Well, there are just so many to try, and it never made it to the top of the list; maybe I felt like I knew it because I had been to the Carniceria Guanajuato&#8217;s taqueria next door to the one on California. Anyway, I was looking for a new place and gave the Ashland and Chicago one, that once was Dion Antic&#8217;s late night hot dog stand with stripper pole, a try. It&#8217;s fantastic, good enough that no one should miss the two of the three La Pasaditas up the street that have closed. Really flavorful carne asada, good pastor despite the lack of a pastor cone, it&#8217;s a platonic ideal level cheap taco joint. </p>

<p><strong>Trio&#8217;s Pizza.</strong> I had to take a couple of family members to the airport near rush hour, and wound up driving almost the whole way on surface streets (Milwaukee, Higgins), so that gave me a chance to get pizza from an obscure neighborhood place that came recommended on Yelp. Though as I often note on Great Unknown Pizza hunts, <em>every</em> place has somebody on Yelp calling it the best pizza ever. This proved it. Thin crust was actually pretty decent, if too heavy with cheese. Stuffed was even heavier with cheese, otherwise bland, but the second layer of crust atop the cheese, which usually goes unnoticed, was all too obviously unbaked dough on this pie.</p>

<p><strong>Pticek&#8217;s &#038; Son.</strong> Shortly after doing <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-polish-food-in-chicago">this survey</a> of Polish places, I happened to be way down southwest by Midway scouting another list, and spotted this bakery. And as always happens, you find a list-worthy star right after the list goes up. They hardly seemed to have any stock by Saturday afternoon, but I grabbed one of the last strawberry-custard coffee cakes, and it was great, really fresh and tasty. It&#8217;s on the dark side of the moon, but worth the trip.</p>

<p>The more I try to get out, the harder podcasting tries to pull me back in! Live from the Taste of Chicago, it&#8217;s my previously dead podcast, with guest Joe Campagna and remote correspondent Ina Pinkney talking about the Taste, the state of dining in Chicago, Boeufhaus, Hot Doug and more. Thanks to the city&#8217;s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events for having us, and to Ed Silha of <a href="http://radiomisfits.com">Radio Misfits Network</a> for engineering this episode. (56 min.) Here&#8217;s some pics from the event by my son Myles:</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not another April Fool&#8217;s prank— my podcast, which I thought I killed a couple of months ago, is coming back for one day only! I&#8217;ll be live at the Taste of Chicago&#8217;s first-ever podcast area, &#8220;Food For Thought&#8221; with my special guest Joe Campagna, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-food-snob/">Chicago Food Snob</a>, and whatever other audio segments I come up with between then and now. Being live, this will be an interesting exercise in whether we can talk that long without the ability to cut the boring parts out! Come see us in person, or eventually it will be distributed as a podcast episode. I promise some interesting news that may imply a certain future for Airwaves Full of Bacon…</p>

<p>(1:27) So it&#8217;s the last episode of Airwaves Full of Bacon. Why is that? Well, I explain in more detail in the first part of the podcast, but basically, I want to do audio but I think a better way than hour-long shows is to integrate it into other media which draw more traffic. Like <a href="http://people2014.chicagoreader.com/harry-carr/">this Reader piece</a> about farmer Harry Carr&#8230;</p>
<p>(4:37) And if you liked the snippet of audio in that Reader piece, here&#8217;s way more about Harry Carr and <a href="http://mintcreekfarm.com">Mint Creek Farm</a>. Learn why he thinks soil is vital to civilization, why animals are essential to growing vegetables, why more bugs and weeds are better, and what he&#8217;s doing in a town that was founded to greet UFOs. Here are a few more pics that didn&#8217;t make it into the Reader piece:</p>

<p>(25:28) My friend Ken Zuckerberg has been one of Chicago&#8217;s most outspoken food critics on Twitter and his blog, <a href="http://fuckerbergonfood.blogspot.com">Fuckerberg on Food</a> (the name came from Graham Elliot during a Twitter spat). He&#8217;s tough, but tough love is good, and there are things he flat out loves, too, so we talk about all of that. Really, he&#8217;s <em>not</em> the worst person in the world!</p>

<p>(54:48) <a href="http://www.huskyhogbbq.com">Husky Hog BBQ</a> is a newish BBQ place in Bridgeport run by Joe Woodel, who has a long and twisted history running from Table 52 to competition barbecue to a food truck— and that&#8217;s not even counting what he did before barbecue. I ran a two-part interview with him at the Reader <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/03/30/how-joe-woodel-of-husky-hog-bar-b-que-went-from-theater-major-to-barbecue-man">here</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/03/31/the-long-day-of-a-bbq-man-continued">here</a>, this is a choice chunk of that.</p>

<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to everyone who listened, ever. I think we did some cool things and went some cool places no one else with a Chicago food show would have done, and I&#8217;ll be back with audio in some new way, stay tuned.</p>

<em>Daniel Zemans and first-time hunter John Lenart stealthily approach their prey.</em></p>
<p>When Daniel Zemans and I started hunting for <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?cat=387">Great Unknown Pizzas</a>, part of the point was to see if there was a pizza as good as a Vito &#038; Nick&#8217;s or Pat&#8217;s Pizza that had gone unknown to the city beyond its own immediate area. But another point was to search out a certain <em>kind</em> of pizza. When thin crust pizza started in America, it tended to be the very thin, cracker-like crust. A simple pie. But over time big pizza chains realized that they could fill their customers more cheaply by selling pizzas that loaded up on the cheapest part— bread— relative to the more expensive parts like cheese and meat or vegetables. So the pizza we liked finding best was at the place that started making it the old way in the 50s or 60s, and never stopped, never followed the siren call of Domino&#8217;s&#8217; or Pizza Hut pan pizza&#8217;s profitability at selling spongy bread topped with cheap toppings.</p>
<p>As it turned out this latest excursion would demonstrate both sides of this theory of pizza history in spades. Two pizzas adhered to the origins of American pizza— and one sold us a whole lot of bread. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7585/16817462900_03bcc277d9_o.png" width="502" height="372" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-01 at 7.47.40 PM"></p>
<p>The area picked for this latest excursion was the suburbs just past Midway and the city limits on the southwest side—places you&#8217;ve mostly never been, like Summit-Argo, Lyons, Hogdkins, Countryside, the area bounded by Ogden and I-55, just south of the Brookfield Zoo. Working class suburbs, with at least some Italian presence, they well fit the traditional parameters and m.o. of the Great Unknown Pizzas quest:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our modus operandi is to order thin crust sausage, thin crust because it’s more common and takes less time, sausage because it best shows off the skills or tastes of the restaurant, if they make it themselves or even if it merely shows their own taste preferences and the level of quality they’re willing to pay for… Our main method for identifying them is simply searching Yelp for ones that give off clues that they might be promising. Every pizza place has somebody calling it the best pizza in the world, that doesn’t tell us anything; we’re more interested in comments that a place makes its own sausage or does something else that gives a clue that there’s blue-collar craftsmanship at work here.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so, the southwest suburban contenders…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mgmax/16379754553" title="IMG_5086 by Mike Gebert, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8695/16379754553_d2a1210267.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5086"></a></p>
<p><strong>Pisa Pizza</strong></p>
<p>Zemans raised the question of whether this place was a worthy contender based on a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pisa-pizza-countryside?select=fVjqUz0OEM71bwfLHS26nA#fVjqUz0OEM71bwfLHS26nA">photo</a> at Yelp indicating the use of a conveyor belt oven, a la the Pizza Hut inside Target. But I was sold by this line in a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pisa-pizza-countryside">review</a>: &#8220;If you park out front on La Grange road, you literally have to walk through an alley to get here.&#8221; Any pizza place that can survive being hidden from normal traffic has got to be good, right?</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7625/16808709180_a8ab4b78f0.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5088"></p>
<p>So we got to 55th and LaGrange and we saw a Mexican restaurant called Cocula (this is when we really regretted Dennis Lee declining to come along on this one) which is supposed to be what it&#8217;s behind. We found the alley and, eventually, tiny little Pisa Pizza next to the currency exchange. The owner was older and a bit brusque at first, but maybe our irrepressible enthusiasm warmed him up as we asked about the surprisingly large array of desserts he has for a hole in the wall pizza place. They were all made by his wife, but he doesn&#8217;t eat them— or pizza, either, these days, as he&#8217;s trying to drop some weight. There was a copy of a magazine called Clean Living on a table, as if to drive home the point of his despair.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7608/16996204095_e9bdfaca82.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5092"></p>
<p>Twelve minutes later we took the pizza out to the hood of John&#8217;s car. Zemans said, skepticism audibly dissolving, &#8220;It looks pretty good!&#8221; It was also flaming hot, having come out of the oven 45 seconds earlier, but we started taking its picture and evaluating its conveyor belt crust. The rippled bottom showed it sat in a pan to go through the conveyor and wasn&#8217;t as crisped up as if it had gone in a classic Foulds oven, but as we tasted it it was surprising how good the pizza was. The crust had a nice double texture— a little exterior crispness, then fluffy and bready— and the stuff on it was all quite good, great sausage with strong fennel flavor, a nice basic tomato sauce and high quality cheese, very handsomely browned. We were very happy with this pizza, the kind it takes a solid local pizza culture to create, and we had to make a conscious effort to stop scarfing it all down to save room for the next two. But already this Great Unknown Pizza quest had a first-tier contender, and had proven the worth of this obscure suburb.</p>

<p><strong>Nonno&#8217;s Pizza</strong></p>
<p>So we&#8217;d had a hit in Countryside and from the parking lot we could see another Countryside pizza place, Ledo&#8217;s, across 55th, while a third was supposed to be just up the street. Maybe Countryside was a great unknown pizza <em>destination!</em> Looking over the Yelp reviews quickly, Ledo&#8217;s did not seem that exciting, but Nonno&#8217;s, second outpost of a Berwyn pizza place*, had solid reviews. Heady with the prospect of discovering an entire town, we zipped two blocks up LaGrange Road and pulled in to the neon-lit establishment.</p>
<p>In doing so, we ignored the sign (scrawled, of course, on a round piece of pizza cardboard) that said &#8220;Pizza Maker Wanted.&#8221; We also ignored the actual pizza slices in the heater thing, which clearly showed a pizza with too much bread, until we&#8217;d already ordered our own half sausage/half Italian beef (hey, it was a place that advertised its Italian beef sandwich— <em>so it had to be good!)</em> We&#8217;d done such a good job of convincing ourselves it had to be special that we walked right past the clear signs that it wouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8697/16810009379_5f78606d56.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5097"></p>
<p>To be fair, the stuff on the pizza was fine. The sauce was a little plain, but the sausage was decent (even though, curiously, cut into quarters rather than made into balls or rough chunks), and the cheese was good quality— though there was probably twice as much of it as it needed. The problem was the crust was just absurdly thick, dense as wallboard, bland as a foodservice breadstick and higher than even the breadiest pizzas we&#8217;d had in the past like Positano&#8217;s (GUP #1) or Phil&#8217;s (GUP #3):</p>

<p>Being so out of balance, it smothered the flavor of everything else; every bite tasted like you were eating an entire box of teething biscuits, the thick cheese in the middle was so shielded from the heat of the oven that it was barely melted. It was like eating pizza toppings on a Sealy Posturepedic. This was a pizza so heavy that when I set two pieces in a to-go container I was holding (not that we really wanted it, but you hate to visibly waste it), the styrofoam immediately gave under the weight.  </p>

<em>Good prep for a life of eating this pizza.</em></p>
<p>They were nice folks, but if this was a good neighborhood pizza once, it took a wrong turn at some point, and the positive Yelp reviews were clearly from people who just wanted to be filled up and didn&#8217;t care how.</p>

<p><small>* The Berwyn location is surely why Nonno&#8217;s is the only one of our three obscure-suburb spots to have ever gotten even an ancient mention on LTHForum, though interestingly, Jennifer Olvera sang the praises of a hot dog stand we saw across the street on <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2013/05/chicagoland-little-joes-a-bastion-for-beef.html">Serious Eats.</a></small></p>

<p><strong>Chester&#8217;s Tavern and Orsi&#8217;s Pizza</strong></p>
<p>As the story was told to us, Chester&#8217;s was a bar for forever in little, very industrial Summit Argo, and Orsi&#8217;s was a family run Italian joint a few doors up, and at some point the third generation of Chester&#8217;s was ready to close it and the dad of the current Orsi bought it and merged the two businesses, so now it&#8217;s a bar and it has a pizza kitchen in the back. I was sold on this one by <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/orsis-pizza-summit-argo?hrid=6I6YEU2Zk__fIW2UuQQvOQ">an entire post</a> at Yelp which claimed that Chester&#8217;s was once an Outfit hangout, certainly possible in the bad old days given our proximity to Cicero. But on this Tuesday night, all Chester&#8217;s was was a dive bar with some video poker and cheerfully rowdy guys on one side, and a side room which you could have taken the family to on the other side, and a couple of nice folks running it who were proud to tell us all about it once they understood that we were on a mission from the Pizza Gods and that we pretty much loved their place. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7653/16376089943_cbeb6d9e42.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5107"></p>
<p>Me, I loved it not least because it had the most complete collection I&#8217;ve ever seen of those 1970s plaster busts of nostalgic 1930s stars that used to be dorm room fixtures back in the day. This is less than half of the collection, see if you can name them all:</p>

<p>Anyway, we ordered beer and, noticing a (round cardboard) sign that they sold frozen pizzas, asked nervously if they were still serving fresh ones. &#8220;He&#8217;s about to shut it down,&#8221; the bartendress told us, so I blurted out &#8220;large sausage&#8221; and we got our order in as we watched the Sox to the tune of the heavy metal the regulars put on, which got an eye roll from the bartendress. </p>
<p>10 minutes later our pizza came. It was love at first sight, a super-thin cracker crust that was already shedding brittle cracker pieces just from her setting it down:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8704/16376092773_8edb5708cf.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5113"></p>
<p>And it lived up to it. Good sausage and cheese, a simple sauce that had a little bit of neckbone-gravy caramelization flavor to it, and that great, shatter-in-pieces-in-your-mouth crust. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8723/16809997449_5a811149ec.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5115"></p>
<p>For me, this was one of the two best we&#8217;ve tried (along with Pizza Castle in GUP #1) and an instant candidate for the next time I do a Best Thin Crust list. Zemans interestingly made his case for preferring Pisa slightly, and it&#8217;s true that the sausage was the best there, which is no small thing, but mainly he made the pronouncement that this was the first quest to date where two out of three were top tier, and I have to agree. (I think John agreed in general, too, even though this was his first outing.) Chester&#8217;s/Orsi&#8217;s, not too far past Midway, next time you&#8217;re way way down that way, check it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking at other bakeries for a way to boost business,&#8221; says Jonathan Ory, the big, bearded maker of delicate French pastries at Bad Wolf Coffee. &#8220;I saw the way other places were making a killing on doughnuts with all these weird flavors—Chicagoans will eat <em>anything</em> if it&#8217;s got a hole in it. I played with some things like a red velvet canele, but to me the real action seemed to be in these fusion pastries, like the Cronut. So that&#8217;s pretty much where the idea came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ory goes in the back of his shop and brings out a fresh tray of kouign-amanns, the buttery glazed laminated pastry that have become his hallmark. &#8220;I already had something people loved,&#8221; he says, as he peels them off the sheet of wax paper, pulling up thin layers of baked caramel with each one. &#8220;But I needed a way to expand that market into other dayparts to fully monetize that core competency. So I thought, why not add savory flavors?&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7589/16306311674_2000634751_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="IMG_5371"></p>

<p>That&#8217;s when you realize that there&#8217;s something different about Bad Wolf today— a hint of Italian seasoning and oregano in the air. Ory opens a pot of simmering beef. He pulls out a pair of tongs and pulls out the thinly sliced beef and places it on one of the pastries. He spoons out some giardiniera from a jar, then closes the sandwich with the second kouign-amann. Then he grips the whole sandwich with tongs and gives it a dip in the broth.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8704/16741361530_0ca2ae0497_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="IMG_5412"></p>

<p>The taste is transformative, the butteriness of the pastry adding a richer mouthfeel to the traditional salty, spiced beef which the vinegariness of the giardiniera cuts through. &#8220;I experimented with some other cross-cultural combinations— the beurre-ito, the Paris Breast-of-chicken caesar, the Sloppy Joe Canele-wich— and I&#8217;ll probably keep working on them. But honestly, this one was such a natural that I figure I&#8217;ll probably be dealing with lines out the door for Boeuf-Amann for at least six months before I have to invent something else to keep Chicagoans happy. Like a carrot muffin with pulled pork on it, or just squirting lard directly into your coffee or something. If I can keep coming up with these, in five years I can retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every restaurant reviewer seems to eventually get around to explaining why reviewing is a crummy job, which flies in the face of the rather obvious facts that it&#8217;s 1) free food and 2) writing that people pay attention to; the only way it could seem better to normal people who do real work would be if it included this (remember, Mastroanni was playing a <em>magazine journalist</em> in <em>La Dolce Vita</em>):</p>

<p>Happened to me more times than I can count. The <a href="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/after-seven-years-of-sampling-charlestons-finest-fare-a-critic-bids-adieu/Content?oid=5087342">latest</a> is Charleston City Paper critic Robert F. Moss, and if he has one good point, it&#8217;s that a lot of hot scenes— like, say, Charleston&#8217;s— are not that deep. There&#8217;s half a dozen stars and then there&#8217;s Contemporary American in strip malls. (Mmm, scallops!) As it happens, I read this piece in Tampa— actually St. Pete Beach, on the Gulf coast just a long bridge or two from Tampa— and I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better illustration of its point. Florida is a place that gets a bad rap for dining, land of early bird specials and unadventurous bargain-minded eaters, generic restaurants that blur the line with retirement community lunchrooms, and I saw some of that, especially at breakfast. You could do some sad, boring dining here, I think, if you had the knack for such, but then that&#8217;s true of everywhere in America. But Tampa definitely has its high points and a bit of an indigenous food culture which is well worth exploring, rooted in its immigration patterns (Cuban, Italian, New Jerseyan) and proximity to water, and appreciated enthusiastically by the locals. In five days I pretty much felt like I had had at least one of everything Tampa had to offer; it isn&#8217;t deep, but it was enough for us to have a good trip and be glad we chose it.</p>

<p>The good news was that our friend the internet made it possible to dine with remarkable efficiency, zeroing in on top places for nearly every meal. In particular I want to give credit to JeffB and others in <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=15&#038;t=12760">this thread on LTHForum</a> dating back to 2005; you might not want to take 2005 advice very often, but this is all about places that have been the same since 1965 (if not 1905 like Columbia), so that was fine, and it was cool to think that that dated back to my old LTH days, and to think that it was put there a decade ago like a time capsule for me to open now. Also, <a href="http://chibbqking.blogspot.com/2013/03/tampa-cuban-sandwich-crawl.html">this post by Titus Ruscitti</a> gave an excellent overview of the sandwich scene, and it was put to the test as well. One note: we skipped probably the two places you&#8217;ve heard of. I&#8217;ve been to two different branches of Columbia over the years, and was never wowed enough by its kind of Spanish food that I felt I <em>had</em> to check out the 1905 original in Tampa. And I would have enjoyed Bern&#8217;s, the old school steakhouse with the deep, deep wine list (especially dessert wines, eccentrically), but it just wasn&#8217;t the place to go with my son. They&#8217;ve been there forever, they&#8217;ll be there when I get back.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first stop was my own discovery (in the sense that means I found something that everyone locally knew about, of course). We missed an exit but were close enough to drive surface roads, so we got off— and immediately spotted <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34607-d388781-Reviews-Coney_Island_Sandwich_Shop-St_Petersburg_Florida.html">Coney Island Grill</a> in St. Petersburg, dating back to 1926:</p>

<p>This is a Detroit-perfect place serving quite good Coney dogs with beanless chili on it, no fries cheeps (or cole slaw in my case), and root beer floats. We were happy as could be finding this after flying and spending too much time at the car rental place.</p>

<em>It was overcast much of the week. Still better than zero degrees in Chicago.</em></p>
<p>St. Pete Beach&#8217;s main strip is somewhat generic American contemporary restaurants, mostly seafood with some steak places to give you a break, but on the road leading to it we spotted a unique place spoken of highly, which was seafood— but smoked, not fried. Ted Peters serves a pretty simple dinner— smoked fish, salmon, mackerel, mahi-mahi or mullet— with pretty basic but first-class sides (German potato salad, cole slaw again). I&#8217;d have gone for a stronger fish, but hoping to get my son to try it, I went for mild mahi-mahi and the smoked fish spread. Liam had hot dogs anyway.</p>

<p>Afterwards we chatted with the guy running the smokehouse and got to see the last of the night&#8217;s fish. The fish spread— which was fantastic, even better than the dinner— we learned was, I think, 70/30 mahi-mahi/mullet. This was cracker soul food, and a must stop as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>

<p>Ybor City, the early-1900s cigar-making neighborhood, looks like it&#8217;s become Tampa&#8217;s Bourbon Street over the years, with a lot of chain dining and Hey Let&#8217;s Get F&#8217;d Up! places to drink. Still, there are some places that have survived and are worth a visit, like La Tropicana, which JeffB compared to Manny&#8217;s for its cafeteria-like, aldermen-and-power-brokers-and-city-workers feel. I went there first for a baseline on the Cuban sandwich and also a Tampa special, the devil crab, which is a big fried Spanish-style croqueta made of all the scrap meat left in a picked-over crab. It&#8217;s a little spicy, a little funky, and tasty though I didn&#8217;t feel the need to try one at every stop (for one thing they&#8217;re pretty huge). Anyway, the Cuban was nice and I guess I see the difference in bread used in Florida, but it was a little slighter than I thought; I&#8217;m ready to say you can get a pretty darn good version of a Cuban here, too, even if it is on Gonnella bread. In any case, the best thing— which you can&#8217;t get so much here— was Liam&#8217;s fried fish sandwich on the sweeter, yellower Cuban bread. They know how to fry fish here like Memphis knows how to fry chicken.</p>

<p>As demonstrated by dinner at a place called Sea Critters, which I found on Trip Advisor or something when I decided I didn&#8217;t want to travel far for dinner, too. It&#8217;s in Pass-a-Grille, a little more of a cutesy upscale vacation town area than the generic strip in St. Pete Beach; I didn&#8217;t have a huge need to shop for $200 blouses or nautical knickknacks, but Sea Critters was a lively supper club-ish waterfront place where people in their 60s and 70s were actually eating after 7 pm, and they fried a piece of grouper just fine, too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve looked for barbecue before in Florida without great success, but meeting up for lunch with an online friend near Bradenton, we went to a place in Ellenton called Hickory Hollow BBQ, and it proved to be a pretty good sit-down BBQ joint with a lot of quite good Southern sides (your choices for that day are shown on a pig-shaped wooden board with the specific offerings velcro&#8217;d to it). </p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16112454724_629f1fcbc7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1726"></p>

<em>What to do while waiting to be seated at Hickory Hollow: play with the goats.</em></p>
<p>Back in Tampa, one place I definitely wanted to check out was a busy lunch spot called Brocato&#8217;s, located in some metal sheds by the highway. Amusingly, there was an interview I had to do which was held up the previous week, and so I wound up standing in the muddy parking lot of Brocato&#8217;s after lunch, interviewing by phone Chef Blaine Wetzel, a Noma and Manresa veteran who runs the ultimate farm to table getaway 2 hours from Seattle, <a href="http://www.willows-inn.com/lummi-island-dining.htm">Willows Inn on Lummi Island</a>. <em>This is the life we&#8217;ve chosen!</em> But farm to table though it wasn&#8217;t, I knew my choice of Brocato&#8217;s was good because when we were leaving another parking lot later, the attendant saw our leftover Brocato&#8217;s drink cups and complimented us on our tourist acumen.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8642/16542568148_0c18e4f03c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0015"></p>
<p>Anyway, two things I knew I needed to try: the Spanish gallego soup (basically pork and garbanzos) and their Italian deli version of a Cuban. The soup, alas, was not that exciting; I have a feeling it would have had more flavor, and softer garbanzos, about four hours later. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8606/16704236356_04a0a0e012.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0008"></p>
<p>The Cuban, though, was terrific. One thing I&#8217;ve always kind of held against the Cuban sandwich is that it&#8217;s pretty sparse— a thin strip of ham, a thin strip of pork, it just doesn&#8217;t live up to my ideals of sandwich excess. But this one did, this one was fat with ham and cheese and especially dripping juicy pork, as indulgent as a wettest Italian beef. (It doesn&#8217;t look as huge, somehow, but it was.) This is my idea of a(n inauthentic) Cuban sandwich, one that tastes like American capitalism.</p>

<p>The next day I couldn&#8217;t face another Cuban, as we went to another Titus recommendation, Wright&#8217;s, so I had The New Yorker, basically a pastrami combo sandwich. This is a funny place, packed as can be, the line having a little Soup Nazi demandingness to it&#8211; if the Soup Nazi was instead a sweet Southern lady. (Don&#8217;t ask me how that makes sense, but it did.) They griddle most of their sandwiches, served on their own perfectly round bread:</p>

<p>Anyway, a good place though Brocato&#8217;s would be first choice for its total local flavor. Titus&#8217; old post says they had one in the airport, too, so I planned to get a Cuban and take it home to my other son, but alas, that seems to have been replaced by lesser chain dining.</p>
<p>I mentioned that breakfast was the least exciting meal overall, and we tried a couple of local spots that were nothing special and slightly generically depressing, plus a Waffle House which was, well, Waffle House. The one breakfast spot I wound up liking and returning to was an Italian cafe and bakery in St. Pete Beach called (what else) La Casa del Pane, which did nice versions of Italian pastries including a highly credible sfogliatelle. I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks well of it, it was packed every morning with older folks who, nevertheless, were standing up for eating good things and being sociable over espresso and refusing to give in to wheat toast and egg white omelets. Rage, rage against the dining of the Lite, good people of New-Jersey-Sur-le-Gulf.</p>

On the minus side, it’s not a great time in history to make a <em>living</em> at writing about food and drink, but on the plus side, at least it’s never been easier to break into the field. That’s because it’s never been easier to get people to see your work without already having been published.</p>
<p>The first thing is that you simply must write. Writing is not just about being smart and clever, it’s about having the energy and focus to do a lot of it, and quickly. So go get yourself a free blog at Blogspot or Tumblr, and start writing. A lot. Write about what you eat, but also start doing the kind of thing that someone would like to publish—interviews, lists, think pieces, whatever. Blogging about your personal experiences is good practice, but you need to show you can do more than talk about yourself.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true you’re working without getting paid. You and everybody else. Every mathematician started by doing geometry in high school. Every baseball player played it in the street with other kids before signing with the Yankees. You need to do a bunch of writing for free first, to 1) get better at it 2) prove you can do it, day in and day out. That&#8217;s the way the world works. (Believe me, a year from now you&#8217;ll be glad some of what you wrote wasn&#8217;t paid for, or seen, by anybody!) Don&#8217;t think of it in terms of a living yet, because that&#8217;s too depressing— the only way you&#8217;ll make a living at it right now is with the rare staff job at a paper or magazine. </p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;m all for having a different job entirely when you&#8217;re young; I think you&#8217;ll be a better writer for being out in the world, working and interacting and gaining a wide range of skills, than if you spend 12 hours a day typing inside the cramped confines of your own head. Go work in a cannery like Steinbeck or sail on a whaling ship like Melville or whatever it takes to have some experiences and observe other people. (Tending bar is good too, especially for food writers.) </p>
<p>Two more things: learn how to promote your stuff in a non-obnoxious way on social media, and use it to make new contacts online. And if you can take pictures with a decent camera, do. Being able to supply photos with an idea always makes it easier to sell. One more thing to start getting practice at now.</p>
<p>A few months pass, you’ve got some pretty good pieces, and you want to actually get published. There are a lot of places that will give you a shot&#8230; for free. Well, eventually you’ll want a firm policy against doing that, but for now, the exposure is worth more than the tiny fee you’d make anyway. So look for publications, see what they actually publish—don’t pitch Best River North Bars For Hooking Up to a publication that focuses on recipes for moms—and pitch them ideas that are like what they do, but not exactly what they’ve already done.</p>
<p>Here’s the secret of pitching (indeed, any job search). The person who hires is not looking for someone who is fabulous to be their new best friend. The person who hires has too much work and is looking for someone who can take a chunk of it out of their hair and come back with a finished piece. That&#8217;s it. Be their no-fuss solution, show them you can solve that problem for them with no drama and minimal help from them and return with a perfectly good piece, and you’ll soon get more assignments than you ever expected.</p>
<p>Respect the parameters of the assignment. If they say 500 words, turn in 475 to 510, not 1200. </p>
<p>You’ll get edited at this point, and one important thing is learning how to respond to editing. Some of it will be very good advice about sharpening your points and making your writing more compelling. That’s the best thing that can happen to you, even if it stings a little; that kind of editing is your grad school. Some of it, alas, will be somebody who knows less than you about your subject, screwing your well-thought-out piece up. Learn the difference and how to take it in stride. If someone is really hard to work for, simply fade out of their pool of pitching writers without a fuss, getting a reputation for being a pain to work with will get around.</p>
<p>Now you’ve got half a dozen pieces published. It’s time to professionalize your online image. This could be your blog, or it could be on a new site, but you need to find a way to look like a pro, not just a blogger, and to highlight your published work and direct people to it. The game here is, you pitch an editor who never heard of you, the first thing she’ll do is go to your site and see who you are. You want her to see your published pieces and instantly know you’re a pro who can get assignments done (see previous point about “solving that problem”).</p>
<p>And from there, it’s just a matter of getting better at writing and at networking over time— and pitching places that pay better. The things writers have always done, but you happen to live in the time that offers more online tools for doing it without having to have gone to the right school and made the right friends than ever before. Good luck.</p>
<p>Finally, the world is full of more advice about actually writing than I could ever repeat, but when it comes to food writing, an especially sensual subgenre, you can’t do better and pithier than Mr. Samuel Clemens:</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t say the old lady screamed. Bring her on and let her scream. —Mark Twain</em></p>

<p>I popped into <strong>Vera</strong> one morning recently for coffee. A couple of my friends were already there, chatting up Mark and Liz Mendez about the new coffee and doughnuts they&#8217;ve started serving. It didn&#8217;t feel like being at a restaurant, though, which is to say, it felt like what all restaurants should feel like, hanging out with friends. The Mendezes were talking about the coffee they had selected, the one that came the closest to the perfection they had in their heads. Mark talked about making coffee and how the tiniest changes—quantity of beans, water temperature, etc.— could radically affect the final beverage. He weighed out the water on a scale, he weighed out the beans, he took three or four minutes to pour me what turned out to be the best cup of coffee I&#8217;ve ever had in my life. </p>
<p>A bit later I decided I might as well eat lunch, so I ordered a tortilla (the Spanish potato-egg-pie kind). A perfect simple little plate, with a perfectly-dressed salad on top. Do I really mean to use &#8220;perfect&#8221; this many times? Am I not setting off a round of adjective inflation? No I am not, and yes I do. Everything tasted the best it could ever hope to be, not because it had shaved truffle on top but because it was itself, in perfect balance and harmony. Mark said of the tortilla he made that he didn&#8217;t even like that kind of cold snack, he doesn&#8217;t like cold leftover pizza. Think about that. He made the best example imaginable of something&#8230; <em>that he doesn&#8217;t even like.</em></p>
<p>This is why I love Vera. In a show-offy scene, and I&#8217;m all for that so far as it goes, he&#8217;s seeking the perfection of humble things, he&#8217;s obsessive in pursuit of the small details that mean everything. He&#8217;s Hattori Hanzo, making the best swords on earth. To eat food of such unassuming quality in a setting of such easygoing welcomingness is the thing all of us who love restaurants love, love to fall in love with. We search for new places to fall in love with. Sometimes it happens, sometimes you only see how easy it is to fall short&#8230;</p>

<em>This post needs another picture. Chocolate doughnut at Vera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlatan.</strong> I&#8217;ve liked what Matt Troost does with Italian food since the short-lived Fianco, and I&#8217;m far from alone in my love for Three Aces. Service there has always been, charitably, random at best, but it was a bar so you took it in stride. Charlatan is still something of a bar but generally seems to be more of a restaurant. This is news that has not entirely reached the service staff. I&#8217;ll take it in stride when I&#8217;m greeted, as you so often are, with a puzzled, increasingly hopeless examination of the reservation system— &#8220;You say it&#8217;s&#8230; <em>Gebert</em>? And you have a reservation&#8230; <em>here?&#8221;</em> I think that&#8217;s an unforced error— is it that hard to have passing familiarity with your 6 pm reservations at 6 pm, or at least pretend, &#8220;Ah, yes Mr. Gebert, your table is right this way&#8221;? That would go so far to set the evening off on a welcoming note, rather than one that feels like getting stopped at Immigration.</p>
<p>But that happens everywhere, almost. I have to say, though, there was one thing that really put the vague service in perspective. A plate of octopus was brought to the table with the customary greeting, &#8220;This plate is really hot,&#8221; and set on a corner by me and Liam, my 13-year-old. And then&#8230; our waitress walked away. And I realized I had no way to share it with anybody else at the table who might actually want it, like my wife. I didn&#8217;t have a spoon; I couldn&#8217;t pass the hot plate. They might as well have delivered it in a lockbox without the combination. I had to flag our waitress like she was a cab to get something to serve it with, a request that seemed to strike her as no more than a harmless eccentricity to be indulged in a customer.</p>
<p>The octopus, by the way, was terrific. Mike Sula <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/mike-sula-reviews-charlatan-west-town-three-aces/Content?oid=15779838">described</a> it as &#8220;the beefiest-tasting octopus you&#8217;ll ever encounter,&#8221; which I took to mean that it was big chewy pieces like octo-steak, but no, clearly there was all kinds of rich beef stock this stuff had been stewing in until it was marshmallow soft and tasted like an octopus that had been clutching a Christmas roast. There were some fantastic glazed carrots in it and a sort of romesco pesto all around it, looking like ground circus peanuts. This was a dish that promised all kinds of wonders and made you want to keep Charlatan close to you forever.</p>
<p>Surprising, then, that the star attraction— pasta— fell short in varying degrees. A plate of rabbit casconcelli (imagine really long agnolotti) had beautiful supple texture, but the meat was lost in mascarpone and golden raisins, sweet wrestling savory to the mat without much of a fight. Still, the silky texture of the pasta was entrancing. My wife and one son both ordered different dishes of spaghettini, though, and in both cases they quickly solidified into solid clumps of pasta. I debated with some friends on Twitter the probable cause— too much starch left in the water by a busy kitchen? Fresh pasta not sauced fast enough? I don&#8217;t know, but after 5 minutes you had to saw this stuff like a pork chop, and one of them which promised a <em>sprinkling</em> of chili powder was showered in snowdrifts of the stuff the way the beignets at Cafe du Monde are coated in powdered sugar.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d love to love Charlatan, there&#8217;s huge potential here and some dishes that I&#8217;m sure on some days are great, since I had at least one. But I suspect it&#8217;s a place that became a hit faster than it could learn its own ropes and assure a constant level of quality. I&#8217;ll go back in three or six months and see where it is then.</p>

<em>Uni toast at The Izakaya at Momotaro.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Izakaya at Momotaro.</strong> I wrote <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2015/02/03/beneath-momotaro-the-citys-other-new-izakaya">a lengthier review</a> of this at the Reader, so go there for that. Short answer: atmosphere and cocktails only go so far to take you to Japan, but the food is really well executed. Interestingly, when I left the place I said to my dining companion &#8220;I really liked that, but we kind of ate everything I would want to eat on the menu, I don&#8217;t know how quickly I could go back. In the week since then, though, I&#8217;ve felt love growing in me. The big Momotaro upstairs is kind of intimidating, flashy and noisy and expensive; the downstairs feels like where you could go and be one with your Japanese food experience. And that seemed to be how the servers and cooks acted, too—like they knew that the real communion with their food was happening in this quiet, more contemplative space. The zen at Momotaro is downstairs.</p>

<p><strong>Dal Paeng Yi.</strong> There&#8217;s a Korean strip on Bryn Mawr that I try every few years. It seems like there should be some real family-run charmer along there, but I have yet to find it. I hit this place with a friend for lunch one day, it was friendly and they could use the business, I wanted to be charmed, but it was just fair. It claims to be a Korean noodle shop, though noodle dishes were mostly crossed off of the most-crossed-off menu I&#8217;ve ever seen. Anyway, my friend had soup— I think hanjae guk, I forget— which he didn&#8217;t think much of, I had bibimbop in a stone pot which was decent, too much sochugang (hot sauce) in it but it at least developed a little bit of a crispy rice crust, though not like the fearsomely crisped-up crust I cut my teeth on at the late Kang Nam in Chowhound days. So it was just fair, I think the couple who run it are well on their way into retirement and its better days are behind it. </p>

<p><strong>Scofflaw</strong> is an old vet of our scene by now, but I&#8217;d never been there, partly because I&#8217;m happy for good cocktails but not so much on the prowl for them that I&#8217;d find myself at Kedzie and Armitage wanting them. But I&#8217;m working on a piece about a certain food item for Thrillist right now, and they were reputed to have a good one. All the internet affirmed this, so of course I get there and it&#8217;s been off the menu for a year. But I&#8217;m told, the burger is good, it&#8217;s like their take on an In&#8217;N&#8217;Out burger. Well, it&#8217;s not bad, but it kind of shows how getting that kind of balance with things like lettuce and tomato on a burger is hard; I don&#8217;t get as much burger out of the burger as I&#8217;d like, I get a lot of lettuce and tomato dressed with mustard. The most basic of American dishes, but not always that easy, it turns out. They get the fries right, but the pimenton sauce that comes with them is oddly flavorless; if you&#8217;re going to replace Heinz, the replacement actually has to be <em>better</em> than ketchup. Easy to see why people love a neighborhood place serving high level craft cocktails for $8 or $9, but based on what I had this isn&#8217;t much of a food destination— at least not until you&#8217;re looking at it through a couple of cocktail goggles.</p>
<p><strong>Dough Bros.</strong> This has gotten relatively little notice, except from my friend Ken Zuckerberg, and at first glance it would call for little notice. It&#8217;s a nondescript Formica-clad pizza slice joint downtown, on a low-rent strip of State Street next to some bar you never went into on your way home after work or whatever. If the name registers at all it&#8217;s probably because of the really odd fact that one of the guys who developed it was Roland Liccioni, as in, the classical French chef of Les Nomades, etc. (See Mark Mendez talking about him <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=402">here</a>.) I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s still involved, though there is still a pizza slice called The Roland; in any case, to me it just looked like a typical slice joint doing something kind of like New York style, stiff, slightly burnt-looking slices in the case. They didn&#8217;t look like a minute or two in a hot oven would do much more than dry them out even further, but I figured it was worth a $4 experiment. I ordered the Roland— lemongrass-tinged sausage and a criss-cross of Sriracha atop it; the pizza went in, and came out surprisingly quickly. No way this could be anything special.</p>
<p>From the first bite of the crust, crackly-crispy and yet with some deep chewiness, I was in awe. I was in love, in this unlovable space. The lemongrass sausage and other stuff on top were tasty, fresh, well-balanced, but above all that crust was just amazing, even more amazing for having come out so beautifully textured out of reheating. This is one of the best pizzas in the city, no joke. If you work near there, you need to go there today, and often.</p>

<p><strong>Hienie&#8217;s Shrimp House</strong> is a fried chicken and shrimp stand on the southeast side— we <em>have</em> a southeast side, you ask? Yeah, basically it&#8217;s what you see from the Skyway just before you cross into Indiana, a deeply unlovely declined industrial area that once was the neighborhood around the steel mills. Anyway it was one of the places Titus Ruscitti did on <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-undiscovered-wings-in-chicago">this Thrillist list</a> we each did half of, and Myles after reading it wanted to try some wings, so we decided to make the long trek there. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nothing place— I thought it&#8217;d at least be a bar, but it&#8217;s just a bare takeout place with a few tables— but the chicken was <em>great</em>. We ordered it both fried and as wings, and either way crispy and lightly seasoned, as good old school chicken as you&#8217;ll find in Chicago. The other thing Hienie&#8217;s is famous for is a luridly orange sauce for the chicken, in a color and consistency I last saw when my mom bought us a set of fluorescent paints in the 70s. It&#8217;s a local favorite on the southeast side (after it got some LTH attention, Kevin Pang wrote <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-15/features/ct-dining-0315-home-plate-hienies-20120315_1_chicago-hot-dogs-mustard-loncar">this piece</a> that pretty well sums up its history, including that it doesn&#8217;t actually originate at Hienie&#8217;s, but never mind). It&#8217;s pretty easy to tell from your first taste where that tomato soup color comes from— it&#8217;s basically yellow mustard with bright red hot sauce in it. At first taste I didn&#8217;t think chicken needed a mustard taste, but it grew on me, and I wound up taking some with some chicken I made to a Super Bowl party so friends could sample the authentic taste of 103rd and Torrence. I love this town.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the city episode! All the stories have to do with dealing with this city&#8230; and the City.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7523/16218724865_e0a1b1183d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_3867"></p>
<p>(1:16) First up, chef Greg Biggers of Cafe des Architectes in the Sofitel Hotel takes me inside their circuitous kitchens to tell the story of how he had to work with the City to get to do the things he wanted to do&#8230; notably, <a href="http://www.cafedesarchitectes.com/Chestnut-Provisions">make cheese</a>. It&#8217;s a great look inside the health and regulatory process in Chicago. </p>

<p>(20:06) Then I talk with underground chef Julia Pham, whose <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BadAssBabez">Relish Underground Dining</a> came to a halt when she was busted by the City.</p>
<p>After that, I list some of my favorite Asian restaurants in the Argyle area. I wrote about Nha Hang <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=3507">here</a>, and made <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=34">this video</a> about the old Sun Wah. <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/12/02/double-happiness-is-hidden-in-plain-sight-on-argyle">Here&#8217;s</a> more about Double Happiness, where we met up.</p>

<p>(35:05) Kevin Hickey&#8217;s the Duck Inn marks his return to Bridgeport. We talk about that most traditional of old school Chicago neighborhoods, including mentions of <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/ricobenes-chicago-4">Ricobene&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/bridgeport-bakery-chicago">Bridgeport Bakery.</a> A much longer version of this ran in two parts <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/12/15/chef-kevin-hickey-discusses-the-duck-inns-roots-in-bridgeport">here</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/12/16/chef-kevin-hickey-on-making-haute-bar-food-at-the-duck-inn">here</a> at the Reader.</p>

<p>(50:01) And finally, I talk with Kate Bernot, late of Redeye, about leaving Chicago. <a href="http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/restaurants-bars/redeye-chicago-bernot-nightlife-column-20141118-20141117,0,3106360.story">Here&#8217;s</a> her farewell piece.</p>

<em>A Nativity scene in the Zocalo in front of the protest banners about the murders of the 43 students in Mexico, by a gang allied with the mayor of Iguala. This is the kind of thing that makes you think the parts about Herod in the Nativity story probably hit home harder in some countries than others&#8230;</em></p>
<p>So we had plenty of time to eat at many levels in Oaxaca, and with <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5540">my first post</a> devoted to the low end, this one will cover off the higher end in various forms. Oaxaca apparently is convinced that it&#8217;s the next hot dining destination, or so I read somewhere, and I&#8217;ll say this for it: it may not be as polished as current dining capitols, but the prices are so reasonable that you can experiment with little fear that you&#8217;ll get ripped off. It&#8217;s hard to complain that execution is a little below Chicago standards, as judged by a pork dish fairly crudely butchered, or that service is a bit rushed at a tasting menu, when it&#8217;s going for, at most, about a third of the cost in Chicago. Restaurants here have the kind of enthusiasm that forgives a lot.</p>
<p>I mentioned that Rick Bayless was not far from where we were—to judge by a tweet, I missed him by about 20 minutes in the Zocalo, the central square, one day—but I already had some advice about where to eat from him, by way of Topolobampo&#8217;s chef <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/crispy-cocks-comb-squash-mole-andres-padilla/Content?oid=10442178">Andres Padilla</a>. So I made reservations in advance for two of them, Origen and Pitiona, though as it turns out, even in the tourist-heavy Christmas week it seemed like you could pretty much walk into any place in town. </p>
<p>The main thing was just knowing where to find them—the fine dining Oaxaca is kind of in a different area than the busy everyday tourist Oaxaca, centered on the bustling Zocalo. The restaurants around the Zocalo are, according to most guidebooks, kind of middling, but we visited one called <strong>Del Jardin</strong> a couple of times for quick meals and local atmosphere, and it was quite decent—Liam discovered a love for Oaxacan tamales here. Honestly, there&#8217;s almost no such thing as a bad mole negro in Oaxaca, though I think this one was sweetened up a little for the presumed American palate. </p>

<p>But if you want food at a higher level than that, you want to go north from the Zocalo. Just a few blocks and you hit the square around the church of Santo Domingo, which seems to also be the heart of upscale tourist Oaxaca. The square is quieter and less frantic with peddlers, all around it are better restaurants, coffee shops (otherwise often rare in Oaxaca) and the better shopping for Mexican clothing, jewelry and knick-knacky artworks. Also a very happy find in this area on some of the days were street markets devoted to locally produced goods and artworks; we picked up everything from handwoven cloths to carved figurines a cut above the usual tourist geegaws, to local chocolate and manzanilla (apple) jam. </p>

<em>Calle Macedonio Alcala, the main shopping street near Santo Domingo, a couple of days after Christmas.</em></p>

<em>We bought several excellent carvings from this stand, though not this guy, alas.</em></p>

<p><strong>Origen</strong> is a restaurant you can certainly see people like Rick Bayless admiring, because it was the most serious about exploring Mexican flavors and not just doing a Mexican spin on continental cuisine. I couldn&#8217;t tell you what the seven moles are, but I&#8217;d bet I had more of them here than anywhere else, tasting a variety of sauces (which is all a mole is, really) in conjunction with a lot of locally grown things, from squash to quinoa. The downside was that I felt the execution level did not always match the ambition of the dishes; there were at least one dud (a charred romaine salad, which came out a neat rectangle of mushed lettuce with the consistency of a peat bog) and a very good dish of pork rib meat suffered from the meat having been roughly hacked off the bone, fat untrimmed. Still, at about $130 for 4 people it was a creative meal offering a lot of insight into Mexican flavors we didn&#8217;t get elsewhere, and I would recommend it.</p>

<em>Tortillas at Pitiona made of different kinds of corn—the top one made with agave (in some form).</em></p>
<p><strong>Pitiona</strong> was in some ways less adventurous in cuisine, but moreso in form—the chef worked at El Bulli and there was a lot of Adria-esque playfulness in the form of the dishes, and as the first full-fledged tasting menu for the kids (Myles and I went to Ing once, but that&#8217;s it) everyone had a good time waiting to see what they&#8217;d bring out next—usually, curiously, plated on something the shape and size of a brick, like the paint-covered block this plantain fritter arrived on. </p>

<p>Highlights included a venison taco, another with tocino (pork belly)&#8230;</p>

<p>and the most El Bulli-like item of the night, a tomato noodle soup with a spherical ball of cream in it, which you broke and stirred into the soup.</p>

<p>The meal was fun, the restaurant which rambled over several rooms of an old colonial era house was charming, the only downside here wasn&#8217;t execution but service, which raced through the meal and couldn&#8217;t wait to remove any plate that seemed possibly finished. I&#8217;m not sure what the cause of that was—it seemed unlikely they were desperate to turn the table. I think the kitchen probably wasn&#8217;t pacing it as well as they should and the servers were scrambling to make it work. Nevertheless, I&#8217;d recommend Pitiona too; not to dwell on price here, but $300 for four compared to the $500 and up for two you&#8217;d pay in the U.S. for a tasting menu goes a considerable ways toward covering your airfare to dine like this.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t planned to eat at <strong>Los Danzantes</strong>, named (somewhat macabrely) for the most famous carvings at Monte Alban, of captured, castrated rival chiefs, but on the last day before our evening flight, it was right there and seemed like just the place to kill 2 hours at lunch. Which it was; the room could not be more dramatic, surrounded by three-story concrete walls with a catwalk wandering through foliage to a lounge and the bathrooms. Choose your own movie descriptor for this space—Bond villain HQ, the wall of Kong, no matter what, it was undeniable spectacle. (I especially loved that the bar turned out to be made of cars crushed into cubes. Wild!)</p>

<p>The food would have trouble living up to this and despite a Slow Food designation and a high rating (from Americans, presumably) on TripAdvisor, it wasn&#8217;t as artful or intriguing as Origen or Pitiona, tasting more like upscale Mexican flavors on American-style dishes. An appetizer of duck with Mexican spices was best, a white ocean fish rubbed with ash and Myles&#8217; steak were fine, but something advertised as somebody&#8217;s grandma&#8217;s mole rojo didn&#8217;t have the kick or funkiness you&#8217;d hope for. This was the first that seemed more tourist-oriented than a local expression, but still, a grand setting from which to salute Mexico and say goodbye with a daytime drink in hand.</p>

<p>Other than taxis taking the shortcut over the hills, <strong>Itanoni</strong> marked my only venture even further north, into a neighborhood near the Park Llano that seemed sort of like the Upper West Side of Oaxaca, plenty of upscale shops and a relaxed air. Itanoni wasn&#8217;t nearly as upscale as the places above, but Alice Waters is said to have called it her favorite restaurant in Oaxaca and it&#8217;s easy to see why—it&#8217;s very serious, almost curatorial, toward the tortilla and what goes in it, dividing the menu by different kinds of corn from different microclimates, and the fillings specific to those (micro) regions— which you order like dim sum, checking them off on a sheet. (That said, my main inspiration for going here was less Alice Waters than Nick Kindelsperger and what he had to say about it <a href="http://thepauperedchef.com/2010/08/the-five-best-things-i-ate-in-oaxaca-mexico.html#node-578">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Could I really taste the difference in tortillas made by hand between corn grown on the mountains and corn grown on the isthmus? No, but everything bespoke really careful craftsmanship, everything tasted <em>clean</em>, the way Rick Bayless&#8217; Mexican food often does, and when I peeled open this flor de la calabaza tortilla to see its gorgeous petals inside, I felt like the peasant Juan Diego when the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe was found on his cloak.</p>

<p>One last food experience, which both kids would rank among the best things we did on the trip. Belatedly I had the idea of doing a cooking class for the four of us, and found <a href="http://www.themijachronicles.com/2013/11/five-cooking-classes-to-try-in-oaxaca/">this blog post</a> which talked about five popular classes. A couple were booked all week, one didn&#8217;t respond to the email form I sent through its website—and then I saw <strong>Casa Crespo</strong> as we were walking to Santo Domingo from the bus, across the street from Pitiona.</p>
<p>It was an American crowd doing it, save for one Swedish woman, including a couple from Logan Square—who asked me if I knew <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=3831">Grandma J&#8217;s</a> in Humboldt Park. Talking to another couple, a police officer from L.A. and his wife, they mentioned a recent trip to Chicago and how they liked going to places on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives—and said they&#8217;d been to Cemitas Puebla. I told them I&#8217;d had comments from Tony Anteliz, its owner, in response to my Tweets about this trip.</p>
<p>Anyway, we started off by going to a nearby mill to grind the corn for our tortillas, and then to the Sanchez Pascuas organic market to shop for ingredients (and sample some fruits you can only find in Mexico, like black zapote, which is like a plum filled with squid ink). </p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7495/16032650609_0a72756b0f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2626"></p>

<p>Back at the school, we began making an ambitious lunch ranging from handmade tortillas stuffed with cheese, flor de la calabaza and other ingredients, to chicken with mole, a cold avocado soup, and chocolate ice cream. I was really happy that the kids got into it and were proud of what they contributed to making. Gotta do more of that at home. It was a tasty lunch and a great experience.</p>

<p>And after working themselves up to it for most of the week, they tried bugs. At least, Myles put chapulines, grasshoppers, in his tortilla, while Liam at least tasted a salsa that had agave worms ground into it. Dad was proud.</p>

<p>A couple of final notes:</p>
<p>• <strong>Coffee.</strong> We didn&#8217;t have a coffeemaker in our villa so getting coffee before too much of the day had passed was a constant struggle. The only places serving anything like American-style coffee seemed to be in the touristed area between the Zocalo and Santo Domingo, so I pretty much had to be in one of those areas by lunchtime; finding caffeine in the rest of the city could be very hit or miss, or at least require you to sit down for a substantial breakfast to get a cafe con leche (not a fan, but it&#8217;ll do in a pinch). I relied mainly on two Italian-style chains, <strong>Cafe Brujula</strong> and <strong>The Italian Coffee Co.</strong>, with multiple locations in this area.</p>
<p>• <strong>Baked goods.</strong> One thing I&#8217;ve never been wild about is Mexican baking. Mexicans can make really nice French pastries, but their own styles seem bland and flavorless to me, and it was disappointing to see so much of it in the markets and never find anything particularly good. The Italian-style coffee shops were your best bet for sitting down with something to nosh on; buying in quantity, the best French style pastries we found were just west of the Zocalo on Independencia at Pasteleria Carmelita, while we got a nice panettone and some crusty bread for Christmas at Pan &#038; Co. near Santo Domingo.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8626/15605021124_93c08db3ae.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="IMG_1482"></p>
<p>• And one more ice cream place, just north of the Santo Domingo plaza: <strong>Manolo Nieves</strong>. This place had a somewhat unfriendly system— you had to order the quantity you wanted and pay for it, <em>then</em> tell them what flavors you wanted— but the flavors were top notch, a simple vanilla was terrific with burnt sugar notes. I had a rose petal one, which I knew I wouldn&#8217;t like but it was recommended by a woman there, Spanish or Italian or something, and as someone who gives a lot of advice, I sort of felt I had to take it. I&#8217;m still not a huge fan of rose flavor, but it was probably the most I&#8217;ve ever liked any thing rose flavored. By the way, tuna is not tuna ice cream—it&#8217;s prickly pear.</p>

<p>One of the things I most wanted to see in Oaxaca was a single hallway in the markets just south of the Zocalo, the main square, lined with meat vendors and blazing charcoal grills. Yet when I got there, it was frightening and overwhelming, a Dickensian vision of bloody carnage and belching inferno, vendors swirling around me telling me what to buy (onions from him! tortillas from her! drinks from him!) as I could barely keep track of it all. Oaxaca&#8217;s market wasn&#8217;t magical, as the equally frantic <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=3404">Grand Bazaar in Istanbul had been</a>, it was oppressive, a maddening hive of activity and din.</p>
<p>In another couple of hours I knew why I was having such a reaction: I was coming down with the cold two of my family had already had, coming down with it fast and hard, and my senses were already closing up shop in anticipation. The next day one son and I barely went out, and I was faced with the prospect of spending my entire time in Oaxaca in a hotel room as deprived of my customary diversions as a jail cell, while the very idea of spicy Mexican food turned me slightly green. To add to the postmodern preposterousness of my situation, one of the people whose Oaxacan recommendations I had followed, Rick Bayless, was tweeting from within a mile or two all the things I <em>should</em> be doing, as he lived in social media a Martha Stewartish vision of the celebrity&#8217;s glamour-filled, perfect in every way visit to Mexico:</p>

<p>Seeing the families turn out in the zocalo, the square, for Christmas Eve had been one of the goals of the trip— but we&#8217;d have been courting pneumonia to be out that night. Instead we found the only subtitled movie in town— <em>El Hobbit</em>— and plopped into chairs for three hours with big soft drinks on Christmas Eve, as if we were the stars of a Family Channel holiday special called &#8220;The Most American Christmas In Mexico Ever.&#8221; For dinner I ate a prefab ham sandwich at the movie theater. It was <em>great.</em></p>

<em>The zocalo, facing the Cathedral of Oaxaca.</em></p>
<p>And happily, that and 12 hours of sleep seemed to break it. I&#8217;m still snuffling— I can&#8217;t put out my next podcast until my nose and throat clear enough to record the narration— but energy and interest began to return on Christmas Day and stayed with us for the remaining week of the trip. By the end, Oaxaca had gone from a fate I was cursing to a place I was halfway in love with. The first day back in Chicago, I regretted not being able to wander down the street to a tent hawking tacos al pastor. It seemed so quiet, having to have actual buildings for restaurants, after Oaxaca where they sprout between cracks in every sidewalk.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite losing a day and a half in the middle to the cold, and operating at half speed for a few days after that, we saw our way to a lot of really enjoyable food in Oaxaca, a town of about 400,000 which sprawls over the valleys and hillsides a couple of hours inland from the southernmost side of Mexico as it curves toward central America. Booking late, we couldn&#8217;t find anything in the central area, and wound up with a condo in <a href="http://www.villasdelsol.com.mx">a hotel complex</a> up on 190, the Pan-American Highway, in an industrial/residential district of no particular loveliness. But in a lot of ways that was good; instead of being in an American B&#038;B bubble in town, we took the Mexican buses (about 50 cents) into town and got to see things like the Sunday used car market— where everybody with a used car lines up along 190 and, of course, taco tents sprout everywhere. </p>
<p>The Mexican buses alone were worth the opportunity to take— they&#8217;re a whole community unto themselves, the expression of the driver&#8217;s personality, decorated up in various fashions, often with a buddy riding along to call out the stops and occasionally picking up vendors demoing the latest release by local musicians or selling trinkets. Other than the fact that they&#8217;re built for people on average a foot shorter than me, they were always interesting to ride.</p>

<em>We&#8217;re all riding on a pink Mexican bus, a pink Mexican bus, a pink Mexican bus. This was actually a tour bus to Monte Alban, not a city bus, but you get the idea.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Best Tacos in Oaxaca</strong></p>
<p>Oaxaca is so fecund with itinerant taco stands that you could spend a decade here and not sample them all— on the way back from Monte Alban, we saw an entire taco row we&#8217;d never had a glimpse of until then, which had the best-smelling rotisserie chicken of the trip. Another time! The point of taco-hunting, I think, is less to look for some internet recommendation of the very best in town, than to have a sense of how to taco-shop. Look for places where things are being freshly made in front of you, like tacos al pastor being sliced off the cone, or carne asada sizzling on the grill. Up on 190, this friendly place made very good pastor: </p>

<em>Taqueria El Grillito, alas, did not grillito.</em></p>
<p>but another fooled us with the cone sitting out, but the meat being cooked on a griddle. Even there, though, we found something kind of interesting, tacos de papas— what would potato tacos with meat turn out to be? The answer was great drunk food, a baked potato finished on the grill and then topped with meat and cheese.</p>

<p>On the weekend, amid the used cars, a row of Michoacan-style carnitas and taco tents popped up. The carnitas were fantastic, pink as ham and maybe the best I&#8217;ve had, and the taco tent to its south not only served excellent carne asada but &#8220;enchilada&#8221; (which I think is just the same thing with a hotter seasoning). I&#8217;m not really recommending that you hop a bus out of town a couple of miles to try these specific places, but rather showing how high the level is, that almost anywhere you find a few tents making food, it has a good chance of being this good.</p>

<p>But I promised the best tacos in Oaxaca and maybe I can fulfill that promise. Here&#8217;s my theory— food gets better with close competition. So if you were going to find a great taco place, it would likely be in an area dense with competing places, close to the heavy traffic of downtown. The epicenter of tacodom, then, seemed likely to be a specific spot just south of Trujano on the Periferico road that half-circles the central district, a 30s-Shanghai-like warren of stalls next to the enormous Abastos farmer/flea/fenced goods market and right where both the buses and the ride-share taxis all come together in the most harrowing clusterfark of traffic I&#8217;ve ever seen. Naturally, my older son and I took off one night to explore it.</p>

<em>Working the comal at Taqueria Los Cuates.</em></p>
<p>The taco stands here are more permanent, often cramming into a tiny space both a pastor cone and a metal comal, sort of like a convex wok, on which different kinds of meat will be sizzling. One guy operates the comal, another the pastor cone, slicing off meat and then flicking off a slice of pineapple from the top onto the tortilla held a few feet below. Tacos here are small and dirt cheap— two or three pesos, which is 15 or 20 cents each, though like sliders, you&#8217;d probably order a bunch at once, meaning a full dinner could run to as much as $1.50. At the first we tried pastor and tasajo, which is chopped beef (but pretty much has the texture of hamburger):</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7494/15576542663_6fec076d73.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2679"><br />
<em>Our first stop— which part of the sign is the name? I&#8217;m not sure.</em></p>
<p>It was very good, but then we reached the next, Taqueria los Cuates. This time I ordered cecina, marinated pork. The pastor was letter perfect, crispy and with a citrusy tinge, but even better was the cecina, cooked with bits of grilled onion which made it taste like a 30s-style hamburger. The meat was flavorful, the tacos, warmed on the center of the comal, were crispy with little toasted edges&#8230; this was truly, The Best Taco in Oaxaca that we would find that night, or ever. We tried other things that night, including an empanada from a very peasanty-feeling stall which was however just fair (we abandoned it after a few bites), but nothing would top Taqueria los Cuates, and a few days later, we&#8217;d swing by there for another round, just as good, as a pre-dinner amuse-bouche.</p>

<em>Myles and I making notes on video before we forget what we liked.</em></p>
<p>A few more notes on low-end dining:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7489/16010271729_c1e218c3ec.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1335"></p>
<p>• We only tried Pollo a la Lena, grilled chicken once, on Christmas Day, and encountered an odd situation where they didn&#8217;t want to sell us any of the chicken because they were already out of tortillas. At that point I&#8217;d be giving the stuff away rather than waste it, but we eventually succeeded at talking them into charging us the full price without giving us any tortillas. Victory! It was perfectly fine, but you&#8217;d have to take another trip to try more chicken places to get a sense of what makes for the best. </p>
<p>• There was a Tacos Arabes place I saw, near the Abastos area, selling that doner-inspired precursor to pastor, but he must have taken the time after Christmas off, because it was closed every time after that, alas.</p>
<p><strong>The Mercado de Benito Juarez/Mercado de 20 Noviembre</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7557/15576487333_92513ce1b4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2531"></p>
<p>And what about that Dickensian meat hall I mentioned at the beginning? If you&#8217;re not out of sorts as I was, it&#8217;s a must-visit just for sheer chaos and atmosphere, as is the entire market complex just south of the Zocalo. There are actually two market buildings; the northernmost, the Mercado de Benito Juarez, is full of vendors of trinkets, sombreros, mezcal for tourists to take back, and so on, but it also sells a lot of retail foodstuffs, from chickens and fish to baked goods, the local <em>quesillo</em> cheese (which is a million times better than any Mexican cheese you can get here) and moles, and ladies selling chapulines, spicy fried grasshoppers. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/16170464356_c212ae8282.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2529"></p>

<p>The southernmost, the 20 de Noviembre, is full of restaurant stands serving comida (a homier sitdown lunch than taco stands), usually Oaxacan tamales, Sopa Azteca, that kind of thing. To be honest, although we had a nice meal or two there, after we had been to some of the other markets in the area the 20 de Noviembre seemed grimy and oppressive with both the restaurants and the vendors constantly hawking you (and some elaborate system of hoses bringing up foul odors from the nether regions of the building), and I&#8217;d recommend a much more relaxed experience at one like the Sanchez Pascuas organic market a few blocks north.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7465/16195537522_3a0ce8c2bb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1334"><br />
<em>A pleasant comida of Oaxacan tamales and soup in the 20 de Noviembre market.</em></p>

<p>But there are two food stops in the first building, the Mercado de Benito Juarez, that you want to make. One is the aforementioned meat hall, which is somewhat separate and difficult to find from the inside, most easily found by looking for its separate entrance on the east side of the building. It&#8217;s an elemental food experience well worth having, though I was a bit disappointed that all the steak seemed to be thinly sliced and grilled to chewiness; I&#8217;d have loved a thicker cut cooked to medium rare. You order by the kilogram; we got one kilogram, 1/4 the balls of spicy chorizo, 3/4 steak, plus onions, salsas and tortillas, each ordered from and paid to a different person, in an atmosphere of complete frenzy where it seems hard to imagine anyone really collects all the money they&#8217;re due, but apparently they do.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8570/16194419351_9bbfb1e775.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2511"></p>

<em>La Chagüita.</em></p>
<p>The second is La Chagüita, an equally chaotic ice cream stand. Rick Bayless talked about this on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thefeedpodcast/final-bite-oaxaca-ice">The Feed</a> but was vague about the precise location, and the rest of the internet is vaguer yet when not flat-out wrong (like Google Maps), so let me tell you the easiest way to find it: it is inside the Mercado Juarez, which has five main aisles, and the stalls in each are numbered something like 15, 115, 215, etc. La Chagüita is #27, so enter at the southeast corner, where the fresh fish are, and look for the first aisle, the two-digit numbers. Go straight north in that aisle and you&#8217;ll soon hit it (and other ice cream places). </p>
<p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16009038670_12029e7b53.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="IMG_1475"></p>
<p>Anyway, the reason that you want to do this is for the wildly exotic array of flavors of— what is it exactly? Sorbet? A slushy? I&#8217;m not sure, but it&#8217;s pretty great and the scene is highly entertaining. I ordered mango with chile and guanabana, which for some reason provoked hilarity from the staff, but I was happy as could be with my tangy, slushy choices.</p>
<p>That pretty much covers cheap eats; a post on fine-ish dining will follow. But I took two things away from taco hunting in Oaxaca— one, how good the street food is, but two, how good the Mexican food in Chicago is, in that I didn&#8217;t have things that made the food we have here seem a pale shadow of the real thing. Our batting average isn&#8217;t as high, but you can find things here that are about as good as most of the food we ate. Oaxaca is one of the great Mexican food cities, but in its own way, so is Chicago, don&#8217;t let anybody kid you. Well, except for the Mexican cheese.</p>

<em>Liam&#8217;s top 7.</em></p>
<p>I think this was a great year for food in Chicago—so great that everyone knows what was great about it and more or less agrees already. Who can’t love 42 Grams and Parachute and Baker Miller and so on? For one more list to justify its existence at the very end of the year— when it feels like they’ve been steadily appearing since October, like Christmas ornaments at Target— it has to show rigor and novelty and not just look like a subset of the monster lists of 100 best things that suggest we live in such a renaissance of culinary wonders that we don&#8217;t even need to make choices at all. </p>
<p>Pete Wells introduced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/dining/nyc-best-new-restaurants-2014.html">his New York Times list</a> with a similar viewpoint, and in particular called out the first fish-or-cut-bait point for a critic or, in my case, a reporter who attends media dinners: “Have I gone back, or wished I could?” Which of course really means, would I spend my own money there? In several of these cases I attended media events  or tried the food for free while taking its picture or something, but in every case that made the list, I returned happily on my own dime. Believe me, food writers don’t get any more sincere than that.</p>
<p>That helps get you past the other moral speedbump, which is that all these places are run by really nice people who are trying really hard and you want to be nice to them and like what other people like. Pick the place that everyone likes and no one will question your judgement, but no one will notice it that much either. So I try to name the places that really struck me, even if it means consigning some places I liked a lot from chefs I know to the seeming purgatory of a runners-up paragraph. <em>I’m sorry! It’s not you, it’s me! </em> But the heart wants what it wants, and it wants different things from all over town and at all levels, and a true list for me has all kinds of food side by side, and the presence of one is not an aspersion on another. I come back to what Duke Ellington said (but I got from Peter Schickele) about music when whether jazz could be as good as classical was a serious debate: if it sounds good, it <em>is</em> good.</p>
<p>As always, my only rules are that the citation is for at least one specific dish I loved (and more to the point, still remember), even if it’s also for the restaurant as a whole; and the dish has to be something new to me this year (so I couldn’t really credit Paulina Meat Market for the fact that their housemade pastrami seems to have taken a leap up in quality of late). Here goes:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2895/14245941560_22f7570e48_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_1665"> <img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8664/15962354980_4c7e84de5c_m.jpg" width="240" height="163" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-30 at 1.52.58 PM"></p>
<p><strong>10. Fried chicken threeway tie: [Evanston] Chicken Shack, Five Loaves Eatery, and Fork.</strong> Hey, I didn’t say only one restaurant per entry on the list was a rule! I did <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-chicago-fried-chicken">two</a> fried chicken lists for Thrillist and tried a bunch of fried chicken that was new to me this year, and three standouts deserve shared praise for being nearly as good as the platonically perfect homemade chicken in my head that I work to get ever closer to at home. The first two (one in Evanston, one a sweet breakfast and lunch cafe on 75th street) earn it for not only frying well but seasoning properly; so much fried chicken is texturally right but needlessly bland, but these places know how to use their salt and pepper shakers, and the smoky sweet barbecue sauce at Chicken Shack is the best argument high fructose corn syrup ever had for itself. </p>

<p>The third, a perennially overlooked farm to table place in Lincoln Square run by a former Lettuce chef, takes a far more baroque approach to the chicken half of chicken and waffles—it’s marinated in black tea and ginger and who knows what all—but the result is wonderfully complex and crispy. Also, it comes with candied bacon.</p>

<p><strong>9. Kohlrabi salad, gemelli with sundried tomatoes and bottarga, A10.</strong> Chicago has lots of Italian food and yet I seem to have more and more friends who find it disappointing. Worse yet, I have to agree with them at least a good deal of the time—Chicago knows how to make a lot of B level easy to like Italian (-American) food, not so much A level Italian cooking that shows the Italian love of beautiful ingredients highlighted simply like jewels in a setting. The A though is well placed in the name of Matthias Merges’ Hyde Park spot, which to me, more than Yusho, fulfills his promise of bringing Trotter-level technique and precision with flavor to reasonably priced, accessible food. </p>

<p><strong>8. Pate de campagne, tagliatelle with beef heart/pig&#8217;s blood ragu, etc. Tete Charcuterie.</strong> I tried Tete Charcuterie’s food at a preview where I took pictures, and found it very well crafted but thought, well, here’s a heavy meat palace I’m not likely to go back to over and over. And I’ve been back twice myself, and set up a business dinner for my wife there as well. So I guess I liked it more than I thought! Yes, it’s devoted to meat, often pretty strongly (I had a pork liver pate there with two other diners which was a bit too strong for all of us), but the chefs are clearly guys with high overall skills who can not only make a beautifully balanced pate or sausage, but do the same with a salad or a plate of pasta, too. We remain desperately short on French restaurants, but in its own, straight-out-of-the-butcher-shops-of-Les Halles way, this is the best French restaurant opening in some years.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3877/14724663857_4141fde245_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_1447"></p>
<p><strong>7. Pancit noodles, kare-kare, fried kawali, etc. Isla Pilipina.</strong> It may have been one step back for Filipino food with the quick closing of Laughing Bird, but a cuisine that baffled me for years is finally making progress toward becoming widely accepted like other Asian cuisines. For my own part, I’d tried Isla Pilipina years ago, as chronicled in a post at LTHForum that was mainly about the <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=399">transsexuals who dropped in for fried chicken</a> the same night, and not been inspired to return for a good decade. But the place soldiered on, in a Lawrence strip mall, and especially under the second generation, grew its skills and improved its menu—and returning at long last, I loved the homey yet brightly flavorful food as much as Chinese or Thai.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5611/15157353004_f470e230c9_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="IMG_1102"></p>
<p><strong>6. Oatmeal, toast, Baker/Miller Bakery &#038; Millhouse.</strong> Okay, I’ll be a partial exception to the universal love for this place, even as I know and like the owners—I’m not wild about the muffins and baked goods. They seem heavy and a bit hippie coop-whole-grain-good-for-you-ish. The bread is heavy, too, but in a good way, as in, a slice of this is like eating a bread steak. It’s the closest we’ve come to lembas bread, a few nibbles filling you satisfyingly for the whole day. As for the lusciously creamy oatmeal, how often do you eat something that’s an entirely new texture? It’s miraculous.</p>
<p><strong>5. Miso ramen pozole at Arami, by Rick Bayless.</strong> I considered leaving this off because it was a <a href="http://www.rickbayless.com/the-frontera-arami-mash-up-it-happens-october-12/">one-off at Arami in October,</a> which happened because Arami chef Fred DesPres is married to one of Bayless&#8217; chefs, but I decided, why not mention the kind of serendipitous collaboration that happens on our scene all the time? Anyway, it was the best of miso ramen, and the best of pozole, made into one hearty Japanese-Mexican dish with all the soupmaking chops of a chef who I think is sometimes more seen as a curator of food culture than the kitchen master technician he (also) is. I just remember on the first season of Top Chef Masters, Bayless was kind of condescended to by all these French and Italian food chefs, <em>like you&#8217;re gonna win this with tacos pal,</em> and then they&#8217;d go feed the people passing by or at an event— and they all went goggle-eyed when they tasted Bayless&#8217;s stuff, and he won the whole season. This was the kind of dish that did that. </p>

<p><strong>4. Dim sum in Toronto.</strong> There&#8217;s a whole post about that <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5450">here</a>, but to summarize, best xiao long bao I&#8217;ve ever had at 369, great pork dumplings and other things at Dragon, and the amazing King of King&#8217;s Pork candy at John&#8217;s. Thanks Renee!</p>

<p><strong>3. Bing bread, pork belly mung bean pancake, pat bing su etc., Parachute.</strong> I&#8217;ve believed Asian food is the future of American dining for a long time, but it took until Fat Rice to have a place in Chicago that hit the sweet spot of hipster, almost comfort food atmosphere with bright, sometimes challenging Asian flavors. And one of the joys of Fat Rice was watching it improve and grow more confident with each meal in its first year or two. Now I feel the same way about Parachute, which is one of our best new restaurants and gets better and more interesting each time. If you want to subscribe to a place that sells tickets for a new menu every four months, that&#8217;s all good, but for the same kind of experience, don&#8217;t forget to simply try a rising star like this place every few months during its most fertile early days of self-discovery.</p>

<p><strong>1 (tie). Charcuterie, Thuringer, Fried Brussel Sprouts, etc. at The Radler; and tasting menu at 42 Grams.</strong> I went back and forth on what should be number one before finally deciding to do the cop-out and call them a tie. The thing is, they&#8217;re such perfect examples of opposing approaches that they sum up so much about how I think about food. 42 Grams is ambitious, daring, a look-at-this! menu of magic tricks; it&#8217;s just fun to go on a journey like this, be part of the show, agree to be wowed time and again. Where The Radler is unassuming by comparison, so relaxed a neighborhood place that I feel it is underappreciated because it demands nothing of you, yet the skills at every level are so high and the finesse so exacting that you <em>should</em> pay it more attention. One is a special occasion, the other makes an ordinary occasion special; they&#8217;re both experiences I&#8217;m immensely glad to have had.</p>
<p><strong>RUNNERS-UP</strong></p>
<p>Places I feel guilty about leaving off:</p>
<p>Boka, especially after a more recent meal, Lee Wolen is making beautiful plates that are as finely executed as at any of the tasting menu joints, but in a more easygoing setting with the more traditional app-entree-dessert format. That is deservedly a recipe for packing the house every night.</p>
<p>MFK, which makes such nice simple stuff, I love the philosophy but maybe the very fact of being simple and direct like that makes it hard to say, &#8220;This was a wow!&#8221; about any one thing. It&#8217;s sure nice to go to and hang out in, though.</p>
<p>River Roast, I&#8217;m the last guy to just want a steak for dinner but I used my son&#8217;s birthday as an excuse to go here a second time and eat all the meats</p>
<p>Cellar Door Provisions: I have certain Kenny Z-like issues with $14 open face sandwiches with three slices of beet on them, but that great dark crusty bread and those great dark crusty croissants are, well, great, dark and crusty.</p>
<p>Low-end places I seriously considered: Red Hot Ranch for the fake In&#8217;N&#8217;Out burger that&#8217;s better than In&#8217;N&#8217;Out, <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2014/04/mezquite-pollo-express.html">Mezquite Pollo Express</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/12/02/double-happiness-is-hidden-in-plain-sight-on-argyle">this chicken soup</a></p>
<p>Place I just went that I&#8217;m still processing: Oaxaca</p>

<p>(1:55) First up, I talk with Don Curry, who recently launched the Negro League baseball-themed Southern Pitch Food Truck. You can follow it on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/southernpitchfoodtruck">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/southernpitchft">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>(12:10) Then I hang out with chef Nick Lacasse and owner Scott Worsham of <a href="http://mfkrestaurant.com">mfk</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the razor clams dish referenced multiple times above; <a href="https://www.eatmorsel.com/scottmfk/480-eating-in-america-part-i">here&#8217;s the piece</a> Scott wrote for Morsel. My favorite fact about M.F.K. Fisher is that she was a gag writer for Bob Hope in the early 40s, no joke.</p>

<p>(30:38) In 2012 I made a documentary about butchers called <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=3499">The Butcher&#8217;s Karma</a>; the part about Bartlett Durand and <a href="http://www.blackearthmeats.com">Black Earth Meats</a> was this segment, The Zen Butcher. We talk about what happened since then, none of it good. (There&#8217;s a longer version of this interview and a fuller telling of the story <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/11/11/wisconsin-vs-meat-part-two-the-end-of-black-earth-meats">here</a>.) <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598476613/save-black-earth-meats">Here&#8217;s</a> Black Earth Meat&#8217;s Kickstarter.</p>

<p>(40:30) And finally, Anthony Todd and I talk Michelin, Shake Shack and other things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been cranking out a ton of work for the Reader, Thrillist and other things, including two print pieces for the Reader in the next month, so blogging has been a low priority, alas. Nevertheless I want to make notes on some things before I forget them entirely, so here&#8217;s lots of notes, starting with the Montreal chunk of our Canada trip in August. If it doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot of new things to have tried, well, I also ate <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-ramen-in-chicago">all of these</a>.</p>

<p>MONTREAL: Other people (David Hammond) have thought nothing much of <strong>Schwartz&#8217;s</strong>, the famous Montreal deli, but besides gratitude for it being open late Sunday night when we got to town, it charmed me as old Jewish delis with the sheer exuberant life of such places always do, and the smoked meat (pastrami in other words) was plenty good. As for <strong>St. Viator&#8217;s</strong>, I wasn&#8217;t wowed by Montreal bagels, I see the virtues of the smaller, chewer bagel with a hint of woodfire smoke, but it wasn&#8217;t something that changed my life. That said, I wouldn&#8217;t be against them being more accessible, either. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/15079244036_384ced494d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0561"></p>
<p>The next night we ate at a cute pizza and sort of Bristol-ish meats and fresh things place called <strong>Dolcetto</strong> in the old city, which was nice, but a price tag of over $200 Canadian for a few small pizzas, salads etc. drove home just how expensive the town, especially that area, is. We decided not to even think about money for the next two nights. As I observed in the <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5450">Toronto section</a>, I typically go to other places for their unique low-end dining rather than the high-end dining which may be much closer to what I can get here. But in this case, Montreal&#8217;s high end dining seemed to promise a native Quebec cuisine you couldn&#8217;t find in other cities. Also, it was Susan&#8217;s birthday, or close enough. So we were ballers.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3899/15099251501_097ef494ae.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2048"></p>
<p>Joe Beef was booked weeks before, but it turns out that Joe Beef has another concept two doors down, <strong>Liverpool House</strong>, whose concept apparently is&#8230; &#8220;Just like Joe Beef.&#8221; Honestly, several of the famous dishes in the book were right there on the menu, like the breakfast sandwich with foie:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5573/14915628070_c42bf25dc9.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2050"></p>
<p>Foie would prove to be a major theme over the next two days (as would, I must admit, &#8220;excessive over-ordering&#8221;).  Joe Liverpool was, in the end, a lot like porky places in Chicago, but an excellent example of the genre and all I really remember specifically after that was that we had a good time and sweated butter on the way home. The next, we had&#8230;</p>

<p>More foie at <strong>Au Pied de Cochon</strong>! We just got into the last available early seating and watched the place (which looks very 80s, not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that) fill up around us. Clams with a beer cheese sauce were pretty great, Myles finally got to have poutine, in general we enjoyed Au Pied, I don&#8217;t think the kitchen is as accomplished as Joe Beef but it was satisfying, easy to see why it&#8217;s a neighborhood favorite. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5570/15099133861_5f0206c9be.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2091"></p>
<p>But what is Quebec cuisine? I left feeling that probably more than anybody wants to admit, it&#8217;s an invention of the marketing department, like the ploughman&#8217;s lunch in England (a &#8220;tradition&#8221; invented in the 60s to boost lunch traffic at pubs), at least I can&#8217;t imagine 1900s lumberjacks really making an entire cuisine out of foie and maple syrup like this. </p>

<p>One other thing we did there: Liam and I went to the Jean-Talon Marche, a food market with plenty of shops for charcuterie, bierocks, etc., and an area full of fresh fruit, which I bought for the long trip back.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5577/14915589508_b438795b62.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2042"></p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t really find anything mindblowingly different, but it was certainly a pleasant day with him; he&#8217;s a good, curious companion for such places. Especially when he gets a crepe. I made him try to order it in French. Did he succeed?</p>

<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>Now on to things eaten in Chicago!</p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7565/15591552309_6a6d5e08ed.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0723"></p>
<p><strong>River Roast</strong>— I skipped a media preview for this for some other more promising preview, the idea of a meatcentric (but not steak) place on the river from Tony Mantuano (which is to say, Levy Restaurants) seemed total tourist bait. And since then&#8230; I&#8217;ve paid my own not inconsiderable cash to go, twice, and had a great hearty time both times. The whole roasted meats are all satisfying (beef and fish outstanding, chicken tasty but a little dry, a new addition of Berkshire pork very nice but a tad plain, they need to think up something to go with it), while the kitchen sent us a charcuterie platter (head chef John Hogan says he&#8217;s known for his pates; I didn&#8217;t know that, but I can believe it) that was excellent as well. I am not a steakhouse guy at all, but the hearty roastiness of everything at this place gets me right in the nostalgic comfy part of the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Dove&#8217;s Luncheonette</strong>— I&#8217;ve been to this Mexican food American diner from the Blackbird etc. crew twice on my own dime, too. The first time I had pozole, right after having a special miso pozole made by Rick Bayless (as in, standing there serving it himself) at a special event at Arami (the chef there is married to one of Bayless&#8217; chefs), which was fantastic. So Dove&#8217;s pozole was up against tough competition and I just thought it was all right; I also found it nearly impossible to dig out of the enormous bowl with the spoon, without having to tilt the spoon so far that all the pozole fell out of it. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7481/15157915263_7a71a0ac3f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_0833"></a></p>
<p>Better was a side of beets with a little mole, but I have to say I had philosophical problems with it; it was a substantial plate for $8, which to me is completely misunderstanding the nature of diners. They&#8217;re where you go to be among people when you don&#8217;t have anyone to be among. That melancholy separate-togetherness is what diners are all about (see <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-diners-in-chicago-thrillist-chicago">this Thrillist piece</a>) AND SO THERE&#8217;S NO SHARED PLATES IN THEM. (You can share a Sun-Times in a diner; you do not share food, that&#8217;d be like getting too chummy in a men&#8217;s room.) Should have been a single portion, half as much for $4. In a <em>diner.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, went back a few weeks later and had the one thing that wasn&#8217;t Mexican food, sort of a fried chicken and gravy plate, and I liked it a lot better. Which doesn&#8217;t really help, since it&#8217;s the only thing like it on the menu. Anyway, I have some mixed feelings (as I did about Big Star&#8217;s Mexican food in a blue collar 70s America context/concept, frankly) but as always with this group, even a straightforward concept turns out to have more than a few layers to tease through.</p>

<p><strong>Uncle Mike&#8217;s Place</strong>— One thing about doing that diner piece was that after a certain point, I felt like I was writing Ten Places To Get The Exact Same Thing For Breakfast. I needed a ringer that did something different, and I thought of this Filipino diner, which people like Cathy Lambrecht had written about at LTH but I had never been to. I got a big breakfast sampler that included a fried egg over garlic rice, hunks of both tocino (sweetly marinated pork) and steak, a salsa and some kind of sweetish bean puddingy thing. After trying a few better Filipino things, this seemed pretty simple in its flavors—like diner breakfast!—but a good time was had from all. I might do this once a year from here on.</p>

<p><strong>MFK</strong> and <strong>Salero</strong>—Two Spanish-ish small plates places, one I loved instantly, one I don&#8217;t know what I think yet. MFK does simple, direct things with seafood. It&#8217;s the kind of place you can drop in, have three things, be full and go. Well, it&#8217;s too popular to drop in easily at night, but it is open for lunch and in the afternoon. Did I love everything? You don&#8217;t have to, you just try things and some will be really good. Like Vera. </p>
<p>Salero is next to Blackbird, a somewhat more formal looking space, though they&#8217;re friendly at the bar. The sardine thing shown above, that I liked as easily as I liked things at MFK. Other things, like a red pepper stuffed with short rib meat, I didn&#8217;t equally take to. How do you get one place of this kind so quickly, while another kind of puzzles you? I don&#8217;t know, but that was my reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Bohemian House</strong>— The idea of an upscale Czech place downtown is improbable, and for that very reason endearing, surrounded as it is by all the blaring cliches of River North. The inside is like a hipper version of Smak Tak or Staropolska, River North&#8217;s idea of a medieval castle. The cocktails looked bizarrely sweet, the wine list, as my dining companion shelf said, looks like the middle shelf at Jewel, but the craft beer list was good. And really, what did you think you should be drinking in a Czech place, rum and coke?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d read a lot of praise for it, so it was disappointing that the opening courses were all about 3/4 of what they should have been, I thought. A cauliflower salad had too sharp a vinaigrette, a beet salad was all right, the short rib pierogi, gummy, were a particular disappointment. I was ready to write it off when the entrees turned out to be by far the best things—chicken paprikash was maybe a bit overwhelmed by the taste of hot paprika, but it was beautifully roasted, and a roast duck was pretty much perfect (hey, River Roast, where&#8217;s <em>your</em> roast duck?) So I don&#8217;t think this makes my best of the year list, but it definitely makes my Thank God It&#8217;s Not Another Italian Restaurant in River North list, and I&#8217;ll recommend it to those looking for something different.</p>

<p><strong>U Gazdy</strong>— The pierogi above belong not to Bohemian House but to a rustic Polish spot out in Wood Dale, near the southern end of O&#8217;Hare, which Cathy Lambrecht wanted to check out one day. Not that the Polish restaurants in the city feel like they&#8217;ve gone mainstream, but this definitely felt even more rustically out of Chicago, like the building was entirely carved by forest dwarves, starting with rye bread served with smalec, a lard spread, which you use like butter, except for the fact that you think every bite is a mortal sin. The pierogi were very good, a nice light dough, and the schnitzel was all right, but the out-of-Chicago feel was the best part. </p>

<p><strong>La Habanera</strong>— A Logan Square Mexican spot that immediately made me regret going there by confronting me with two strong suggestions of inauthenticity: a menu that translated basic Mexican food words, and a portrait of every white person&#8217;s favorite historical Mexican, Frida Kahlo. Well, that was too harsh a first judgement; it&#8217;s a real Mexican family place, with some accommodations to its neighborhood. I ordered a pambazo, the spicy sandwich where you dip the bread in a spicy chile de arbol sauce and crisp it up a little on the fryer, then stuff it with the usual stuff (steak, lettuce, crumbly cheese). I liked all that, but the chile de arbol sauce was too salty and made it a little hard to love the effect of the bread. I&#8217;d give it another try and see what the standout on the menu is.</p>

<p><strong>El Conde SA</strong>— There are two of these now, one in Pilsen and one closer to Little Village, specializing in a Mexico city treat called tacos de canasta, basket tacos. They&#8217;re premade tacos which steam and stay warm in a basket; they usually just have some form of meat in them. They&#8217;re a little soggy, so after trying them in two places (the other was La Chilangueada) I may not need to have them a lot more until I&#8217;m in their natural habitat, a bar in Mexico City where someone walks in like the tamale lady to sell them. I also had a sope with carne asada and the steak was very good, so I count the tacos de canasta as a bit of a novelty but this place as a whole as a good find to have.</p>

<p><strong>Baker Miller Bakery &#038; Millhouse</strong>— And one last thing which was, honestly, sublime. It&#8217;s the oatmeal at this new bakery from the former 2/3 of the Bang Bang Pie team, which makes a big deal of grinding their own flour. I talked to Dave Miller about it— he says the way they grind it leaves both big pieces and a fine powder, and then he cooks it in half and half, and the oatmeal plumps up into this lush, creamy viscous goo that has a wonderful mouthfeel. It was kind of magical, and when I redeemed my Kickstarter gifts (two bags of whatever grain I wanted), I made sure that the rolled oats was one of them.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>And finally, a cautionary tale, I guess. The irony is that food-obsessed me lives in one of the most whitebread neighborhoods for food, Roscoe Village, the epicenter of Sunday breakfast. So I was excited that we were finally getting a hip-sounding kind of place in <strong>Endgrain</strong>, which grew out of pop-up doughnuts from Nightwood, which is just about as hip as it could possibly get, right? And as it happened, a <a href="http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/05/preview_endgrains_comfort_food.html">preview slideshow</a> would be one of the last things I did for Grub Street.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I took the family for breakfast there. We made the mistake of arriving at 9:40 am, plenty late for breakfast if you ask me. They were open&#8230; but not open for breakfast, just for doughnuts and coffee. And the fact that we wanted to be seated, even if we had to wait to order, kind of flummoxed the (admittedly, very green) server and hostess. I basically had to tell them, look, other people are having coffee, you can bring us coffee too and menus, even if we don&#8217;t order for another 20 minutes. It was ineptitude, not malice. But it left a bad taste, to feel like we were supposed to sit there without so much as water, in a holding pen, for the crime of coming in too early for the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Some months later I went there for lunch. I walk in and there are people at the counter. But I immediately get the Serbian Social Club what-are-<em>you</em>-doing-here vibe. Uh, lunch, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing here? Oh, no, we don&#8217;t do lunch on Tuesday. We do doughnuts and coffee. I suppressed saying &#8220;Not nearly enough to stay open, clearly,&#8221; and left.</p>
<p>And even though I&#8217;d pass it and see it open and full of Logan Square type hipsters at night, I never went back. I often thought I should give it another try, but two tries and never once feeling really welcomed into a place right in my neighborhood meant I never worked it up to try a third time.</p>
<p>And now it&#8217;s closed. Turns out my neighborhood full of families can&#8217;t really sustain a place whose hours have nothing to do with the normal routines of family life. At Logan and Kedzie they might have made it, but they were too out of step for Roscoe and Wolcott. Ironically, I just saw them mentioned in a national article about hip places to eat in Chicago. I&#8217;m sure they were very excited to be in Bon Appetit or whatever it was. This will finally put us on the map! But they were already on a map; they should have paid more attention to where it said they were.</p>

<p>(1:15) I go frog-giggin&#8217; with Iliana Regan of the foraging-based Chicago restaurant Elizabeth and her friends Tonya Pierce and William &#8220;Getty&#8221; Sikora, and then see how she turns foraged frogs and childhood memories into a fine dining dish. It was a long drive, so we had a lot of time to talk about foraging as a trend and a lifestyle on the way.</p>

<p>(24:34) Henry Adaniya (right above) was back in town for Next&#8217;s newest menu paying tribute to his restaurant, Trio, where he gave Grant Achatz his start over a decade ago.

<p>(30:36) So wine retailer Craig Perman wrote <a href="https://www.facebook.com/craig.perman.7/posts/10203219613708991">this</a> on Facebook. Then Shebnem Ince, who works for him, wrote <a href="http://whatwedrank.blogspot.com/2014/09/in-which-i-review-three-italian-wine.html">this</a>, and my friend John Lenart wrote <a href="http://chicagoist.com/2014/09/05/exciting_wine_lists_in_chicago.php">this</a>. What are they all talking about? Wine lists, and why we don&#8217;t have more food writers critiquing them.

<em>Canada remains ever vigilant against American invasion at Fort George, near Niagara Falls.</em></p>
<p>People often ask me before I go to another big city if I plan to eat at [INSERT EXPENSIVE TASTING MENU PLACE HERE]. The answer is almost always no, for two reasons: one, I feel like I should be true to my school and spend those bucks on the people I cover in Chicago, not go chasing the shiny thing in New York. But two, I don&#8217;t feel a burning need to go eat the food of guys in New York who&#8217;ve staged at Alinea and Mugarritz and basically have the same background and outlook on international modern food as plenty of chefs here. If I&#8217;m going somewhere different, I want to eat what&#8217;s really native to and reflective of that area. Barney Greengrass means New York to me more than Eleven Madison Park does, so that&#8217;s what I want to go have. </p>
<p>Up to a point, anyway. So for Toronto, the most interesting thing to try for me was Chinese food; 20 years ago, before so many Hong Kong Chinese emigrated to Canada, I went to a place in Toronto&#8217;s urban Chinatown, but that&#8217;s now dwarfed by the area out in Markham and Richmond Hill, where hundreds of import businesses are served by dozens of Chinese restaurants in strip malls. But for Montreal—if there&#8217;s such a thing as Quebecois food, it&#8217;s at top restaurants like Joe Beef and Au Pied de Cochon, so I did what I never do and got two high-end reservations back to back at those two places (actually Liverpool House, Joe Beef&#8217;s other concept, though as far as I could tell the concept is &#8220;Exactly like Joe Beef two doors away&#8221;).</p>

<p>Montreal will be in part 2, Toronto in this post. But first—we had to drive there. And driving toward great food up through the back end of Ontario is a somewhat dispiriting experience, punctuated by rest stops whose choices are almost Stalinistically identical (Tim Hortons, KFC, Taco Bell, a convenience store called Marché). From there it got culinarily worse, as we went to Niagara Falls, the town of which is a nightmare of alleged fun attractions (wax museums! Dino mini-golf!) which even the kids couldn&#8217;t put behind them fast enough. More attractive for certain was Niagara-On-The-Lake, but it&#8217;s a typical weekenders&#8217; quaint little shopping and eating town, take Napa and replace all the wine geegaws with maple syrup gewgaws. We had lunch and walked around and shopped a little, and we were done.</p>

<p>Finally, Toronto in time for dinner. Online I found a noodles joint called <strong>Chinese Traditional Bun</strong> that sounded promisingly funky, down some steps into a ratty little room, but with ladies making food right by the entrance. They looked at us like we had to be lost, but we convinced them we weren&#8217;t and sat down. We had pretty good xiao long bao, soup dumplings—well, Liam had most of them:</p>

<p>There was also this interesting, sandwich-like thing with lamb in it. It was good, and very unusual— I wonder if it&#8217;s a Chinese thing or was invented in Toronto and has no antecedent back home to speak of. [UPDATE: see tweets at bottom.]</p>

<p>But the best thing was dan dan mien, with housemade noodles (below). Scissors were provided to cut them as you ate. I also ordered something that said it was a lamb stew with Chinese bread in it. I don&#8217;t know what Chinese bread is, there were lots of little pieces of what looked like pasta in an enormous, fairly flavorless bowl of weird lamb cuts. Sometimes the price of experimenting on something new turns out to be that you have to waste a huge bowl of something in front of the people who made it, alas.</p>

<p>On the way there we had spotted a tiny window where a guy offered lamb skewers, so on our way back we ordered the minimum order of four and watched as the guy took them out of a home freezer, rolled them in cookie sheets covered with spices, and grilled them by hand over an electric grill. This would have been more novel if I hadn&#8217;t had basically the same thing in Chicago a few weeks earlier at <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/07/21/the-chinese-police-have-nothing-on-lao-pi-bbq">the skewer place in the Richland food court</a> next to the Chinatown Square mall, but it was cool, nevertheless, to buy street food like this on the teeming streets of Chinatown.</p>
<p>We wanted to get to Montreal early in the week so as not to have all the driving back at the very end, so our last stop in Toronto for the time being was hitting a place in Markham for breakfast dim sum on the way out of town. We&#8217;d actually stayed in Markham, 20 years ago, when it was farm country and the TV series of Anne of Green Gables had been shot nearby (never mind that it&#8217;s set in P.E.I.) Now it was a busy suburban area loaded, absolutely packed, with strip malls of Chinese-oriented shops. </p>

<p>I knew there was a knockoff of Taiwan&#8217;s famous Din Tai Fung nearby, but an article in <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/restaurant-reviews/the-globes-10-best-places-for-chinese-food-in-toronto-hint-go-north/article9237179/?page=all">The Globe &#038; Mail</a> steered me to a place they said was both better and less likely to be packed, <strong>369 Shanghai Dim Sum</strong>. Indeed, at 11 we were the second table there, though it filled up fast. First choice was xiao long bao&#8230; which were the best I&#8217;ve ever had. I&#8217;m a little leery of saying that, since there has been a lot of xiao long bao obsessiveness online, so I didn&#8217;t haul out the micrometer to measure the wrapper. I&#8217;ll just say: most delicate wrapper, best tasting soup, you can&#8217;t argue with that.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/15079230146_c1bd2f9d91.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2000"></p>

<p>Most of the other things we had evidenced similarly quality, from shrimp dumplings to pastries filled with pork. At one point I saw something interesting on a nearby table, a bao with kind of a ridged top, something like a croissant, and quietly asked the waitress what it was, not wanting to seem intrusive toward the other table. &#8220;This?&#8221; she said loudly, sticking her finger right into the middle of their plates. I said yes and she explained that it was a snail. Or snails. I couldn&#8217;t tell if she meant it was just shaped like a snail shell, or actually had snails in it. I decided not to inflict an order of those on the family, but I still wonder.</p>

<em>Renee with the menus at John&#8217;s Chinese BBQ.</em></p>
<p>Coming back after a few days in Montreal I planned another Chinese-palooza with my friend Renee Suen, who writes for <em>Toronto Life.</em> As someone who often guides other journalists, radio hosts, etc. to places in Chicago, I was delighted when I told her that we had gone to 369 Shanghai Dim Sum based on the <em>Globe &#038; Mail</em> piece by Chris Nuttall-Smith— and she replied &#8220;Yeah, I took Chris there.&#8221; </p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/15079286646_5905ca61ec.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2107"><br />
<em>Piri-piri chicken.</em></p>
<p>We planned to meet for more dim sum the next day, so the night before we tried something else we don&#8217;t have in Chicago— we went to a Portuguese grilled chicken and meats place called <strong>Piri-Piri.</strong> To be honest, it wasn&#8217;t that different from all the South American grilled meats places we have, but it was likable enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3898/14915724937_9674384748.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2111"></p>

<em>You have not tasted the power of my Dragon Fu-sion!</em></p>
<p>Since we&#8217;d had Northern dim sum, Renee wanted us to try Southern dim sum too, and she directed us to a place called <strong>Dragon Boat Fusion Cuisine</strong>, which was packed and barely able to contain the crowds that hovered around the host stand and which she had to beat back out of the dining room regularly. We waited a half hour but finally sat, and it was worth it. Things maybe weren&#8217;t as delicate as at 369, which being Northern-style uses a different kind of wheat wrapper anyway, but they were well-made and the fillings were a cut above any that I&#8217;ve had here, from something as basic as pork in an egg white wrap to the BBQ pork bao and this cool-looking thing you dipped in mustard and plum sauce:</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14915726998_1f911e93bd.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_2120"></p>

<em>Custard buns.</em></p>

<em>BBQ pork pastries.</em></p>

<em>Yes, there were children deciding what to order.</em></p>
<p>We were full but not done; Renee wanted us to try one of her favorite dishes, something called &#8220;King of King&#8217;s Pork&#8221; at a Hong Kong BBQ place, <strong>John&#8217;s Chinese BBQ</strong>. It&#8217;s a hunk of meat somewhere in the vicinity of pork belly, double-glazed in a honey sauce. And it&#8217;s awesome, the ultimate meat candy. </p>

<p>My delight in it was slightly diminished by the display in the foyer as you enter the restaurant: an assortment of shark fin skeletons, a reminder that this is the <em>real</em> Chinese cuisine, eating endangered species to this day in north America. China really has set up shop in this corner of Canada, on a scale well beyond the ability of food writers or much of anyone else to fully comprehend.</p>

<em>A photo my son Liam took of the zoology building at the University of Chicago.</em></p>
<p>From the news our food scene seems like it&#8217;s entering a more corporate-concept phase— steak houses and ramen shops from the best-known restaurant groups, every day something interesting closes to <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/05/01/river-norths-last-non-italian-restaurant-to-reconcept-as-italian-restaurant">reconcept as standard Italian</a>, and so on. It would be easy to think that we weren&#8217;t going to see much in the way of personal restaurants this year.</p>
<p>And yet somehow we&#8217;ve had three restaurants open within the past year that seem about as good as they can be at giving three chefs who&#8217;ve been around the scene a while a platform for the expression of their mature selves, personal and without significant compromise. One is <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5353">The Radler</a>, for longtime Vie #2 Nathan Sears, representing his notion of a German beer hall with fresh food, meaty yet light and winning. One is Parachute, from Beverly Kim and her husband Johnny Clark, a Fat Rice-like hipster cafe with Korean flavors and fine dining execution. And surprisingly, the third is Matthias Merges&#8217; <strong>A10</strong>, in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>The surprising part is not that Merges was capable of such a thing— as the guy who ran the kitchen at Charlie Trotter&#8217;s for 14 years, he seems capable of pretty much anything. But his first two concepts were just that, concepts, and that seemed to be the direction he was going. Yusho seemed very smartly thought out as a kind of refined-Japanese-comfort-foody bar, and the concept was independent enough of who was actually cooking there that it would be possible to replicate at least a few times without losing quality— and so there&#8217;s one in Las Vegas, and one coming soon to the same stretch of Hyde Park as A10. His second place, Billy Sunday, seems <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=4639">less well thought out</a>— I liked the drinks (a tonic-based cocktail program) a lot, but the food (helmed by John Vermiglio, formerly of Table 52 and G.E.B.) seemed a weird mess of things that didn&#8217;t go together, or with the setting.</p>
<p>But the point is they both seemed conceived in terms of how to market them to a certain audience in Logan Square. Very smartly so, but still. A10 also originated in a business deal— Merges was <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2013/09/12/matthias-merges-and-why-the-u-of-c-wants-you-to-eat-in-hyde-park">approached by the University of Chicago</a>, which is trying to redevelop 53rd Street to help make Hyde Park more attractive to prospective students and job candidates. (You see U of C security all over the street at night, giving the entire neighborhood a kind of Universal City Walk feel even though there are plenty of non-U of C businesses along there.)</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5575/14506986309_aa14f33c66.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_2555"></p>
<p>So A10 seemed like a smart concept for the neighborhood, contemporary Italian with French and just plain modern touches. (The A10 is the highway that connects Italy and southern France, so the French part is more like the Rhone and the Riviera than Paris or Burgundy.) But it&#8217;s a surprise that it also turns out to be one of the best Italian restaurants in town, and the clearest example yet of how Merges&#8217; Trotter heritage translates to more accessible and reasonably priced food.</p>
<p>I should say that Vermiglio is the official chef here as well, so I have no idea who&#8217;s responsible for what exactly, but Merges did walk in soon after we arrived on Friday night, incidentally blowing my cover (I&#8217;ve interviewed him and videoed him for Key Ingredient; he sent us a couple of extra things and stopped by to say hi). In any case let&#8217;s assume a meeting of minds between the two of them on an approach to food. The salads seemed like pure Trotter&#8217;s, with hair just mussed a little for Italian rusticity— a blend of cucumber, melon, red pepper puree and grilled onions, or kohlrabi and apple slices shaved with downy parmigiano, the kohlrabi sourced, we were told, from the Cook County Jail&#8217;s gardens. Simple height-of-summer produce dressed just enough and no more, and despite the efforts at seeming more casual, nearly as perfect-looking as they would have at Trotter&#8217;s (note the spacing of the tiny bits of chopped green whatever on the kohlrabi salad above). I should note, though, that there was an exception to this that didn&#8217;t delight in the same way, a kale salad with tonnato dressing and pumpernickel (pumpernickel is the new Italian bread, apparently, to judge by this and Cicchetti). It was heavy and wintry, but that&#8217;s our fault for ordering it I guess, more than theirs for having the apparently-inevitable-at-the-moment kale salad on the menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3862/14691250464_a3a1703b18.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_2548"></p>
<p>More than one restaurant has gone downhill after the salad course in peak season, but not this one— the pastas, made in house, were superb. The best was this gemelli with some kind of sauce involving oil-cured sun-dried tomatoes, some kind of roe (bottarga maybe, under another name?), saffron (I think that was in the pasta itself) and lemon. I&#8217;m not sure of the precise composition of it, all I know is that it sang, it absolutely shone of lemony brightness with an undercurrent of brine and cello-deep notes of tomato. I want it for an alarm o&#8217;clock every morning, to jolt me into the light.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5558/14506988169_423d9f95a0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_2559"></p>
<p>My son Liam had bucatini carbonara, which he pronounced excellent (I&#8217;ve made it many times; he quizzed the waitress to see if it was heavy on the pepper like mine is), and we also nibbled on green tomato lasagna with blue crab and bearnaise sauce— I wondered if green tomato lasagna would mean the pasta or what was in between them, but it proved to be the latter. I don&#8217;t think anything was either French or Italian about this, except the basic idea of lasagna, but what it did remind me of was the one thing that I had really liked among the food at Billy Sunday— their version of a hot brown, which was heavy on sliced tomato and mornay sauce, as I recall it. There was also a special of corned short ribs with cabbage, which turned out to be what that would make if you think about it— a reuben in a pan without bread, basically.</p>

<p>Desserts were a little anticlimactic, fine but not as creative-seeming as the savory courses; they included a nice coconut panna cotta and, as at Yusho, soft serve (chocolate malt, which had a lot of barley tang). One other thing I noted about A10— the staff seemed a little older and enthused to be there. A lot of people have wanted higher-end choices in Hyde Park, but I suspect servers from the other restaurants around the area have wanted it even more than most, hoping to make more money than you can at, say, Mellow Yellow or Ragin Cajun. For now, at least, A10 has <em>very</em> interactive and conscientious service which is happy to see you.</p>

<em>Salt for your fries?</em></p>
<p>When I ran across <strong>Ivy&#8217;s Burgers, Hot Dogs &#038; Fries</strong> in Edgebrook, I thought I might have discovered a place right under the noses of many of the more active remaining LTHers who live on the northwest side. Turns out that Rene G, who lives in Hyde Park, had actually <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=14&#038;t=39724&#038;sp=474632">been there</a> and eaten a Japanese dog with seaweed salad (!) there, and there are a handful of other mentions, though more about it opening soon (a year ago) than about how it actually turned out to be. Actually, you know who <em>didn&#8217;t</em> mention it? The guy who wrote <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-chicago-hot-dogs-stands-restaurants">the best hot dog in every neighborhood</a> post at Thrillist, and tried to find every dog spot doing the Hot Doug thing of more exotic dogs. Oh well, it probably wouldn&#8217;t have beaten out Superdawg for that area anyway.</p>
<p>Still, let&#8217;s give it a nod, it&#8217;s always good to know a better dog and burger joint in every neighborhood, especially one close to something you might do, like bike on the forest preserve bike trails at Devon &#038; Caldwell; and while I like the sleepy-50s feel of that area (I spent a few moments reading the 80s and 90s clippings on the front of the Filipino restaurant on Caldwell there), I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a bad thing that something from this century has opened up along there, too. Great smoky Polish, good-looking burgers (haven&#8217;t had one yet), the chili dog was decent but the homemade chili a little watery, eating it was a race against time before the bun fell apart; there are more exotic dogs on the menu, fresh-cut fries— served saltless so you can salt them yourself from the exotic salt bar— and good-looking shakes, plus a message about sustainability in the wood they used for their tables, or something like that. Always happy to know about one more dog spot that&#8217;s pushing the envelope and trying to do something unique.</p>

<p><strong>Barbecue at Mariano&#8217;s.</strong> I wrote about the sushi bar at the Lawrence/Ravenswood Mariano&#8217;s <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5353">recently</a>, and after a couple of more visits around meal times, all I can say is Eataly missed a bet not being located here. The place gets packed every lunchtime and every night, it may not say the best things about a neighborhood if its local wine bar is where you also get toilet paper, but the neighborhood has embraced it for all those purposes. I&#8217;m going to be a little contrarian on barbecue though, at least contrary to my usual position vis-a-vis Mike Sula, who usually blasts a new barbecue place and then six months later I find it&#8217;s not bad. Sula had <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/06/16/supermarket-barbecue-thats-better-than-it-should-be">generally positive things</a> to say about &#8220;Todd&#8217;s BBQ&#8221; here even if he could never find out if there actually was a Todd. </p>
<p>Me&#8230; well, sure, it&#8217;s high among supermarket barbecue, of that I have no doubt, because how much supermarket barbecue isn&#8217;t simply meat that&#8217;s been sauced and got no closer to smoke than the Pall Malls rolled in the meat cutter&#8217;s sleeve? They use a Southern Pride smoker, which has the potential to make real barbecue, so give them points for that right off the bat. </p>
<p>I ordered brisket and pulled pork; the brisket was pretty good, if awfully loose and floppy, like it had spent a lot of time in a warming drawer steaming itself. Still, I&#8217;d put it on the thumbs-up side. The pulled pork (which was, incidentally, chopped, not pulled) didn&#8217;t have enough smokiness and basically, like most supermarket pork it didn&#8217;t have much flavor, but what flavor it did have was a little off, industrially vaguely unpleasing. The sauces (in help yourself bottles at the counter) were all way too sweet, but that&#8217;s easily remedied, just buy your own of something better. There&#8217;s rotisserie chicken behind the same counter which doesn&#8217;t appear to get smoke, and some other chicken, it appears, going on a gas grill. Anyway, a fair showing but better really isn&#8217;t that far away; I will probably drive an extra mile or so for Smalls or somewhere instead. On the other hand, if one person wants barbecue and the other wants sushi, this is <em>the place.</em></p>

<p>I did two roundup lists for <strong>Thrillist</strong> lately, the first on <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-chicago-hot-dogs-stands-restaurants">hot dogs.</a> I didn&#8217;t think there was really any way to rank hot dogs, given that you&#8217;re mostly using the same basic materials (a <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-07-09/features/ct-hot-dogs-20140710_1_doug-sohn-hot-doug-vienna-beef">conclusion</a> someone else came to shortly after), so I decided the sensible thing was to pick one good spot in 25 different neighborhoods. The north side I could pretty much cover from past experience, but it meant Son #2 and I had to make a couple of runs to the south side, trying one dog at each of several places.</p>
<p>Good news, bad news. The good news is that there is one glorious stretch for hot dog-dom on the south side, and that&#8217;s 35th street near Comiskey, not too surprisingly, with three joints— <strong>35th Street Red Hots, Johnny O&#8217;s,</strong> and <strong>Morrie O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s</strong>— making as good a dog as can be found anywhere.</p>
<p>The bad news is: it was surprising how mediocre the rest of the south side was. In particular the natural casing dog, with its snap releasing the garlicky juices, was almost impossible to find at places you&#8217;d think would have them like <strong>Donald&#8217;s</strong> (pictured above), <strong>Parisi&#8217;s, Fat Johnnie&#8217;s</strong> (which somebody ranked as best in town once) and so on. I had a lot of lukewarm dogs in every sense, crowned a few tallest midgets like Fat Johnnie&#8217;s (at least it has atmosphere, same for Parisi&#8217;s; Donald&#8217;s didn&#8217;t make it), and am forced to the conclusion that the best dogs are mostly on the north side, except for that one great stretch of 35th.</p>

<p>Another list was <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-chicago-soul-food-southern-food-restaurants">southern and soul food</a>. I only had to try a couple of places to fill out the list, but it was harder to do that, because you can&#8217;t go try four soul food places in one trip; more like try one, lay on the couch the rest of the day.</p>
<p>So it was a bummer when we went a long way for one that turned out not to be very good, like <strong>Dan&#8217;s Soul Food &#038; Bakery</strong> on 79th. It had some good Yelp reviews and sounded promising from what they said. And it could have been if they&#8217;d ever discovered the salt shaker, or hadn&#8217;t discovered instant mashed potatoes. in other words, if it had more soul! But it was just bland, and used a couple of dispiriting shortcuts.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5586/14674194911_13bb71def6.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1987"></p>
<p>But I did try some better things, and I stand by all the soul food places on that list. Back on the north side, <strong>Carriage House</strong> is a place that didn&#8217;t get a fair shake the first time I went there. Son #2 basically didn&#8217;t want to eat anything, and it kind of ruined everyone&#8217;s evening. So I wanted to try it again and when he got invited to a baseball game the rest of us went. The idea is to evoke Carolina Low Country cuisine, more than the deep South food more common here, and when it does that it can be very good. The balls of braised pork topped with country ham above, for instance, were great, and so were smoked/glazed chicken wings and the fried chicken thigh (though at small plate prices of $9 for one piece of chicken, it makes any of our new fried chicken joints look like a bargain). </p>
<p>The problem came with things that just seemed like upscale food without any interesting southernness. A shrimp and pork belly pie sounds like a deep, savory pot pie kind of thing full of funky, fishy pork and shrimp goodness— but turns out to be two empanadas, basically, tasting mainly of dough, for an absurd $16. The menu needs an editor&#8217;s hand that says, does this one make your eyes roll back in your head with Southern flavors that sing of the heritage of the south, or could you imagine having this same experience, basically, in any kind of restaurant? There are enough things that do the first that the ones that do the second need to stop dragging them down.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the course of this piece there was one long trip down south that I was so happy I made. I had actually gone to <strong>Maple Tree Inn</strong> when I first moved here, somewhere around 1990. It was kind of a Cajun diner in Beverly then, run by a self-taught cook (who learned during the Cajun craze of the 80s) named Charlie Orr. It was one of my very rare trips that far into unknown territory for food back then, and memorable, though I assumed it was long gone in later years. I was surprised when LTHers remarked on it and it turned out to still exist in the southern suburb of Blue Island, in an old speakeasy building. Charlie passed away in 2010, but his family still runs it. </p>

<em>The house special Voodoo nuts, andouille sausage around garlic cloves.</em></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s pretty great. Not just for the extremely well-executed classic Cajun food— my crawfish etoufée was as good as I&#8217;ve ever had, well-balanced and full of life— but for the total package of being in a vintage building on a sleepy, stuck-in-the-50s strip in a small town. We sat on the veranda, which is newer and sunnier, but there&#8217;s an equal case to be made for the dark tavern front room which includes an 1890s original carved bar. If you ever want a getaway from the city that&#8217;s actually fairly speedy to get to (I thought it might take hours, but we zipped right down there at 5:30 on a weeknight), yet feels like you&#8217;ve gone off to Wisconsin with some New Orleans thrown in, it&#8217;s highly recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Valois Cafeteria.</strong> You may think that I&#8217;ve been everywhere. I <em>want</em> people to think I&#8217;ve been everywhere! That&#8217;s part of the brand image! But there&#8217;s always another somewhere, isn&#8217;t there, and probably the most famous place left in Chicago I&#8217;d never been— famous enough that it had a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slims-Table-Respectability-Masculinity-Collection/dp/0226170314/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1405607969&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=slim%27s+table">book</a> written about it— was Valois Cafeteria, the Greek steam table cafeteria line place not far from the U of C. I&#8217;d never been because everybody considers it a breakfast place, really (there is a conspicuous silence on the virtues of any other meal here), and the logistics of hauling yourself to breakfast all the way on the other side of town aren&#8217;t that favorable when you have hungry kids and plenty of places serving the same thing in between.</p>
<p>But Son #2 took a computer camp at U of C and he loves breakfast joints, so there we were one morning at last. How&#8217;s the food? Standard, I&#8217;d say. You could certainly have it elsewhere, and closer (to me), Greek diner food. But even on a fairly sleepy morning with not that many people in the place, you could see why it&#8217;s more than a diner, it&#8217;s the heart of a community. If you&#8217;re a college student, it feels like they&#8217;re going to take care of you and make sure you get fed. If you&#8217;re a working joe with just a few bucks for breakfast, the Greek guys behind the counter in their white uniforms look like the staff of the Ritz, ready to take care of you with military precision. I thought it was interesting that it has a reputation as the great integrated place in a segregated town, because I thought the staff was maybe the most clearly defined by race I&#8217;ve seen anywhere— the Greek guys cook, the black lady takes your money, the Mexican ladies clean up. Those lines don&#8217;t look like they <em>ever</em> get crossed. But it&#8217;s a well-oiled machine that helps a whole community run. God forbid anyone should ever look at that and decide it needs changing.</p>

<p>This is the episode whose theme is no theme! Well, I&#8217;ve just been doing a lot of interviews lately, and here&#8217;s some of them.</p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5574/14437732229_971637b03a.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1908"></p>
<p>(2:04) First up, I go inside <a href="http://chdistillery.com">CH Distillery</a>, Chicago&#8217;s first distillery and tasting room, in the West Loop, and learn what&#8217;s brewing and distilling there from owner Tremaine Atkinson. Although you expect whiskey and bourbon, it&#8217;s interesting to learn that vodka, rum and amaro also play significant roles.</p>

<p>(21:08) Next up I talk with restaurant designer Karen Herold about how she makes restaurants work for success and to keep people wanting to come back. We talk about the design for <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=3615">Balena</a> in particular, but you can read more from her about specific restaurants in <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/05/14/karen-herold-looks-at-her-own-restaurant-designs">the second part</a> of this interview at the Reader.</p>

<p>(39:26) In <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=4476">Episode 3</a> I talked with Chicago Social dining editor Lisa Shames about 2013&#8217;s restaurant issue, and she&#8217;s back this time to talk about <a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/cs/digital-edition">2014&#8217;s. </a>Lots of restaurants get talked about in this including <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/cocello-chicago-2">Cocello</a>, <a href="http://www.nicoosteria.com">Nico</a>, <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5040">Cicchetti</a>, <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5177">42 Grams</a>, <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5080">Dusek&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://a10hydepark.com">A10</a>, <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5227">Tanta</a> and <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=5353">The Radler.</a></p>
<p><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5474/14437731779_4d24d8114d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_2052"></p>
<p>(54:48) And it&#8217;s Ramadan, so I talk about the fasting and the feasting that happens this month for Muslims with Yvonne Maffei, who has a halal food blog, <a href="http://myhalalkitchen.com">My Halal Kitchen.</a> We met at an event organized by <a href="http://culinaryhistorians.org">Chicago Foodways Roundtable</a> at <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2013/10/khan-bbq.html">Khan BBQ.</a> Other restaurants she mentions include <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/usmania-zabiha-chinese-restaurant-chicago">Usmania Chinese</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/delhi-darbar-kebab-house-chicago">Delhi Darbar (D.D. Kebab House)</a>, and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tahoora-sweets-and-bakery-chicago">Tahoora</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, as I mentioned I&#8217;ve been on WGN Radio twice recently with guest host James VanOsdol; <a href="http://wgnradio.com/2014/05/29/james-vanosdol-celebrates-national-brisket-day-with-smoque-bbq/">I appeared with Barry Sorkin</a> to talk about BBQ, and <a href="http://wgnradio.com/2014/06/28/chicagos-top-25-hot-dog-joints/">solo to talk hot dogs.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Radler.</strong> I love Vie and feel deep sympathy with its core philosophy, I&#8217;ve known Nathan Sears who was its #2 for a long time, and a kind of casual but updated German beer hall sounded right up my alley. So why didn&#8217;t I love The Radler the first time? Things were nice enough (except the fried spaetzle, which I think are too dry, like getting Chex Mix as a side at dinner) but somehow it didn&#8217;t click for me that first night, even things others loved like the onion tart were just&#8230; nice.</p>
<p>And that might have been the end of it, if I didn&#8217;t know the chef and respect his work. You try a place, it&#8217;s okay, you&#8217;re done. But there had to be more, I thought. I wasn&#8217;t going to give it up that easily. A month later I went with another friend.</p>
<p>I loved it. I felt entirely in tune with its philosophy. Back in one of my podcasts Nathan had said &#8220;Germans eat tomato salads, but you never see a tomato on a German menu,&#8221; which to me is the most succinct expression of this restaurant&#8217;s reason for being: things grow in Germany, which don&#8217;t fit an American idea of German food, but there&#8217;s no reason not to use them. (He&#8217;s also joked, or not joked, that it&#8217;s really an Italian German restaurant, Italian techniques and desire for fresh ingredients applied to German dishes.) So you get some slices of summer sausage with a salad and spring peas, or fritters with a beet puree and fava beans. What the hell is that? A kid might put that jumble on a plate, you think. Except it&#8217;s great, the combination of salty cured meat or friedness and spring green freshness. Another example came at a all-veal dinner he did with Scott Manley at Table Donkey &#038; Stick: slices of pink veal tossed in a tomato vinaigrette, as light and fizzy as a big hunk of cow could possibly be. </p>
<p>So how can a place be magical twice but strike you as a miss the first time? Is it because the seasons changed? A little, I think, things were greener the second and third time. Did I mature as a human being and a diner in a month? Hey, who am I to say. But mainly, I think it just goes to show that restaurants aren&#8217;t movies or plays or books or concerts. They&#8217;re ineffable, they&#8217;re about the moment on a certain night different from all other nights, and sometimes the moment just doesn&#8217;t work when it should. After three visits The Radler is one of my favorite new restaurants, maybe the best new restaurant of the year, doing wonderful stuff that&#8217;s different and full of life and freshness, with the stalest of ethnic cuisines. It has an easy atmosphere in a sometimes pretentious scene, it has a fine beer list of Germanish things which actually go with food because they&#8217;re not all IPAs. So go. And if it doesn&#8217;t work for you, wait a month and go again.</p>

<p><strong>Kinmont.</strong> I had a great dish by Duncan Biddulph, chef of Kinmont, recently— a kind of fish soup or stew with a puckeringly strong tamarind bite. But it wasn&#8217;t at Kinmont— it was at the Reader&#8217;s Key Ingredient Cook-off party, and I clearly wasn&#8217;t the only one who liked it, since it won among the tamarind dishes and I think won the whole thing. It was a well-crafted and imaginative dish, but when I went to Kinmont, the seafood restaurant Biddulph helms from the Element Collective group (Nellcote, Leghorn, etc.), only half that equation was at work there. Well-crafted, yes— everything was well-executed, certainly, but imagination seemed much more tightly reined in. The first thing we had was the most satisfying— a trout dip, relatively simple but timeless, smoky trout and cream cheese and bits of onion and greens in perfect proportion. It not only fit our mouths perfectly, it fit the faux-midcentury-Wisconsin lodge atmosphere just as well. To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t entirely wild about the concept going in— the faux-lodge thing has been done before, in a Lettuce Entertain You way, at places like L. Woods or The Canoe Club on Halsted a decade and a half ago— but at least it was being carried off really well here by this group.</p>
<p>Clam chowder was likewise nicely executed, satisfying, then the main courses came&#8230; and they were perfectly good pieces of fish, cooked just right, and no more. Is that enough for a concept? It&#8217;s true to that food, but I couldn&#8217;t get that excited about a straightforward fish place that, say, makes McCormick &#038; Schmick look really puny, but no more. It&#8217;s nice that they&#8217;re dedicated to sustainability, and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a market for a pretty straight fish place as there&#8217;s a market for conventional steakhouses, but that kind of safe business dining doesn&#8217;t excite me&#8230; and when I know the chef can do more interesting and eye-opening things, I wish they were on the menu of his restaurant. </p>

<p><strong>Laughing Bird.</strong> Is this finally the Filipino moment? We seem to have enough places trying to make Filipino flavors accessible through other styles of food (Pecking Order with fried chicken, Smalls with barbecue) and Laughing Bird gives us a nice, hip Filipino spot with a familiar chef (Top Chef alum Chrissy Camba, recently at Bar Pastoral). Hey, Portuguese-Macanese worked, why not this?</p>
<p>I hope it works. It&#8217;s not cohesive yet, at its best pulling off Filipino flavors with fine dining finesse, at its least successful (the pancit noodle dish, surprisingly) coming off like an overpriced version of delivery Thai. That&#8217;s the death for any attempt to do cheffy Asian food, the $16 dish that&#8217;s half as good as the $8 version. But the good was good enough that you hope it has the time and finds the audience to work its way to a menu that works as well as Fat Rice&#8217;s does. </p>
<p>A plate of charcuterie was interesting, ranging from super-smooth chicken liver to a block of grilled meat that, nobody wanted to say, was surely inspired by the ubiquity of Spam in parts of the world where Americans went in WWII. I&#8217;d have liked more Asian flavors (and fewer French or Jewish deli ones)— Mike Sula liked the little cubes of adobo gel, but I couldn&#8217;t taste anything in them. Octopus with dinuguan (a blood-based sauce) was great, though, and I especially liked the &#8220;crispy pork a la Nadim,&#8221; which seemed a train wreck by its description: a tough little piece of  tonkatsu (breaded pork) atop some Manila clams in a broth the color of a fire engine, with braised fennel at the bottom. Our server, the bartender, told us to eat it all together, and he was right— that spicy rich broth brought the gnarled pork to life and the fennel gave it complexity that made me wonder why bland things like bok choy are so common in Asian cooking when fennel exists. It was a wow dish; will it and a few others make the awkward space (the former Tank Sushi in Lincoln Square, which is about big enough to play softball in) and somewhat inexperienced servers (the bartender had previously been Tank&#8217;s delivery guy; that said, he was a great host) work in time? Here&#8217;s hoping.</p>

<p><strong>Sushi counter at Mariano&#8217;s, Ravenswood.</strong> Mike Sula <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/06/16/supermarket-barbecue-thats-better-than-it-should-be">reviewed</a>, and had unaccustomed praise for, the barbecue from the mega-Mariano&#8217;s at Lawrence and Ravenswood, and I live as close to it as he does, so I might as well toss in my two cents. I didn&#8217;t hit it for the BBQ, though— I was still detoxing after <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/chicago/best-bbq-joints-chicago">this</a>— instead I went to the sushi counter. And like him, I&#8217;m surprised how entirely respectable the grocery store version can be. It&#8217;s mostly rolls, but you can get sashimi and nigiri with pretty nice quality fish, and at least the dragon roll I had was done well, not gooped up as has become the common practice. It&#8217;s not Katsu, but it&#8217;s certainly as good as a better neighborhood sushi spot.</p>

<p>Disclosure: I was recognized every time at The Radler and comped this or that, including the veal dinner. The others were all paid for, though there might have been a comped dessert at Kinmont, I can&#8217;t remember for sure.</p>

<em>Ryan Kimura, Dave Rand and Gary Lazarski, Local Foods. </em></p>
<p>(2:20) I start off talking local food with, well, <a href="http://localfoods.com">Local Foods</a>, a distributor based in Chicago which is building a warehouse and retail space on Elston in Chicago to bring farmer produce directly to restaurants and customers. <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/04/25/local-foods-finds-a-new-home-for-its-vision-of-a-locavore-future">Here&#8217;s the Reader piece</a> I wrote from this interview. </p>

<p>(17:38) Then I talk with an Illinois farmer trying to grow the ingredients for local beer. He&#8217;s Eric Stiegman of Mammoth Malt, and I met him <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/05/05/meet-the-brewerand-meet-his-farmers">at an event</a> at Jared Rouben&#8217;s Moody Tongue Brewing Co.; I wrote about Stiegman <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/05/09/the-beer-farmer">here</a>. (You may remember that I spoke with Rouben in <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=4599">Episode 4</a>.) </p>

<p>(22:44) Adrian Miller is a Denver-based writer who just won a James Beard award for his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Food-Surprising-American-Cuisine/dp/146960762X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1400903107">Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time.</a></em> (And check out the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/600580615/the-presidents-kitchen-cabinet">Kickstarter</a> for his next project.)</p>
<p>Here are links for the Chicago soul food places he or I mention along the way: <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=2002">Ruby&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/morrisons-authentic-southern-cooking-chicago">Morrison&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pearls-place-chicago-3">Pearl&#8217;s Place</a>, <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2013/11/macarthurs-restaurant.html">Macarthur&#8217;s</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/soul-vegetarian-east-chicago">Soul Vegetarian East</a>, <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?p=3142">Yah&#8217;s Cuisine.</a></p>

<p>(43:45) And finally, May marks the 10th anniversary of a group of us founding <a href="http://www.lthforum.com">LTHForum.com</a>, the Chicago food chat site. I figure nobody wants to hear the history of a website, so I grabbed two of my comrades, Rob Gardner of <a href="http://www.thelocalbeet.com">The Local Beet,</a> and writer for the Sun-Times and everybody else David Hammond, to talk about it all on a more universal level— how did we all get into this business of talking about food online, and how has it changed our lives? I think it&#8217;s a pretty fun and funny conversation (that incidentally demonstrates what things were like back then when we&#8217;d get together). </p>
<p>It took place at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quebrada-cicero">La Quebrada in Cicero</a>, and <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/111045">here is the 2002 Chowhound thread</a> in which I recount my first visit there (David links to the Rob/Vital Information post that sent me there). </p>

<p>no, that&#8217;s not how it happened. It was crazier and more haphazard than that. Let&#8217;s go back. To <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/boards/7">Chowhound</a>. Chowhound c. 2002 was where a bunch of us, though we weren&#8217;t an &#8220;us&#8221; yet, first started talking about food and, more importantly, meeting about it with strangers. We would meet for lunch, at <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/114090">Spoon</a> or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/110562">La Quebrada</a> or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/109845">Kang Nam</a> or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/111717">&#8220;Little&#8221; Three Happiness</a> or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/111315">Los Mogotes</a> or <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/110659">Vito &#038; Nick&#8217;s</a> or whatever the enthusiasm of the moment was, and order the weird things with no concern— as we would have had with normal people— that something might gross somebody out. I learned so much and experienced so much in such an intense short time. But more than that, I came to feel that the city was mine at last. A decade after moving here, I no longer felt like a Kansan temporarily working here but that I belonged to the city, I understood the city, it wasn&#8217;t something too big and alien to ever comprehend. You want to know where to get great tacos? Here. <em>I</em> read a post about it. <em>I</em> made <a href="http://vimeo.com/840503">a movie about Maxwell Street.</a> <em>I&#8217;m</em> the guy that <em>knows</em> Chicago.</p>
<p>But Chowhound was an imperfect vessel for our aspirations. The management didn&#8217;t like us <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/114710">planning events</a> on the board, they didn&#8217;t like us seeming like a clique (even though we tried to be as welcoming as possible). I didn&#8217;t think they were necessarily wrong by their lights— we <em>were</em> taking something public and impartial and making it our clubhouse, even if we&#8217;d welcome anyone into it. But at the same time, I didn&#8217;t feel obligated to spend the rest of my days answering the same questions from tourists over and over, either, as remains Chowhound&#8217;s primary purpose. We outgrew it, plain and simple. </p>

<em>Me and <a href="http://chicago.grubstreet.com/2012/02/will_special_creator_passes.html">the late Will Philpot</a>, for whom the Will Special sandwich at Riviera was named, at TAC Quick, 2004. No idea who the mom and kid are, or who took this picture with my camera.</em></p>
<p>For a while we planned events on an email list, open to whoever wanted to be on it, but that was cumbersome, too; and there was an incident when Jim Leff (&#8220;Big Dog&#8221; of Chowhound) read some minor bitching about Chowhound on it and came unglued about its real purpose being ragging on him. It was time to declare independence from New York, and <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=18&#038;t=31890&#038;sp=375799">twelve of us</a> became the core group behind it. I suggested that we launch our own discussion board and researched open source software we could use; Gary Wiviott got his hosting company, a bunch of Turkish guys, to install PhpBB (the fact that they also installed a Turkish character set would prove to be a problem years later), Seth Zurer put up the <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=22&#038;t=4075&#038;sp=79311">first logo</a> which led me to design one that would be more distinctive (and easier to do on things like T-shirts), and through April and May of 2004 we slowly fiddled around with it, debating board organization, getting our feet wet with a few practice posts (here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=16&#038;t=8&#038;p=16#p16">mine</a>, a thread that was still active as of last August). </p>
<p>We were getting closer to going public when Rob Gardner mentioned it to somebody (Monica Eng, probably) in the press. Suddenly we were public before we meant to be. Hastily, we had to tell the email list what we were up to— and within about 24 hours, we suddenly had a board that had 125 or so members. In retrospect not at all a bad thing, to be off to a running start; and a very good thing to instantly not just be one homogenous group of friends but a large group with many varied interests, who from the start engaged in multiple conversations and revealed new sides of themselves that Chowhound&#8217;s more limited focus had not made room for.</p>
<p>We declared the date of that announcement, May 27, 2004, the official public launch date of LTHForum. Was this LTH&#8217;s golden age? You could argue it wasn&#8217;t, since unbeknownst to 97% of users, it kicked off with a big fight over who &#8220;owned&#8221; it, who would be the Big Dog, loudly argued on the sidewalk right in front of Little Three Happiness itself, as a legless beggar in a wheelchair, clueless about the argument but happy to join in the shouting, yelled something like &#8220;You tell it to The Man! The Man always be tryin&#8217; to rob you!&#8221; (I kid you not— or at least so I was told, I was out of town that weekend.) The issue of ownership (of what was supposed to be a communal hobby), and egos more generally as we started to get media attention, would simmer for years behind the scenes and eventually split us apart three or so years later. When the issue <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-29/features/chi-lth-forum-sold-for-40000-20110629_1_great-neighborhood-restaurants-awards-chowhound-boards-web-sites">became public</a> I had people tell me we should have nailed ownership stuff down right at the beginning, to prevent the embarrassing situation that finally ended the old LTHForum. In which case, I said, none of it would have ever happened at all. It was never about (phantom, to this day) internet riches; there&#8217;s nothing ownership would have given any of us that was worth more than a few good years of collective creative ferment and shared enthusiasm and adventure. Certainly none of the things I&#8217;ve done since— Sky Full of Bacon, Beard award, writing for Grub Street and the Reader, whatever— would have happened without it. (You can get a sense of what we were like in <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=131780#p131780">this podcast</a> I asked Michael Nagrant to do with us.)</p>

<em>Road trip to Milwaukee: Jake&#8217;s Deli, 2004.</em></p>
<p>It had its few years, and life moved on (remarkably, this blog has been around almost twice as long as I helped manage the many <em>unique personalities</em> of LTHForum in their interactions; only one of those seems like an eternity). A version of LTHForum exists, and some people still use that in <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=19&#038;t=39352">that generous, open-spirited way</a> and <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=16&#038;t=37961">discuss things in detail</a> that nobody else is talking about, and bless them for it, while others use it in, well, ways that end in screaming in Thai restaurants. Which is pretty much 180 from the spirit in which it was founded, I&#8217;ll just say that. But some friendships from those early days have lasted the decade and more; and in any case it&#8217;s a very good thing that the comrades of those days have spread out across the world and infiltrated all kinds of things from media to local organizations and farmer&#8217;s markets. </p>
<p>For me the legacy of that time is everywhere that LTHers have spread the gospel that Thai and Mexican food matter, that great food is all over the city, that there&#8217;s so much that&#8217;s interesting out there to taste and do and it all should be talked about in many different ways and places. It&#8217;s Cathy at Culinary Historians, and Hammond at the Sun-Times, and Melissa Graham with Purple Asparagus and Rob Gardner with The Local Beet and Seth Zurer with Baconfest and on and on. It&#8217;s the next generation of food writers— apparently 10 years <em>is</em> long enough for a next generation— for whom Burt&#8217;s and Lao Sze Chuan and Cemitas Puebla and the Will Special (whoever Will was) and mother-in-laws and 30s style burgers (wherever that description <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/112078">comes from</a>) are just part of the fabric of the city, places we <em>all</em> go and things we all eat, naturally, impossible to imagine a time when people didn&#8217;t. We all reap the benefits of that intensive, creative, crazily obsessed time, and take what we gained then with us to whatever we do now. That, it turns out, was the only part of LTHForum that anybody ever truly owned. </p>
<p>So I look back in fondness on this tenth anniversary, and thank all who were present at the creation or close enough, we happy few, we band of brothers (of both sexes). Let&#8217;s go grab a bite sometime.</p>

Mostly I had a pretty firm idea of what I thought the best for each list should be. But in each case, I felt there were a few places in each category that I had been meaning to try forever, and I should try before I passed definitive word on that category. Some made it onto those respective lists— Villa Nova lived up to its pizza rep, I was delighted to find that Duke&#8217;s on south Harlem, which I had blown past to go eat middle eastern food for ages, was as good as it was and used live charcoal for its sausages, and Green Street Smoked Meats turned out to be surprisingly good BBQ as well as by far the most faux-atmospheric fake honky tonk in town, one of those places like at Disneyland where it&#8217;s so dark and midnight-feeling inside that it&#8217;s disorienting to walk into straight from sunlight and early evening; you feel like you just blacked out for several hours.</p>
<p>But others didn&#8217;t quite make the cut— or didn&#8217;t come anywhere near. Here&#8217;s my report on the ones left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mgmax/14228702226" title="IMG_1274 by Mike Gebert, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/14228702226_0335ab89b7.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1274"></a></p>
<p><strong>ITALIAN BEEF</strong></p>
<p>There were several Italian beefs I felt I should try, including Duke&#8217;s and Bari (both of which made the list), and my son Myles had a day off from school the day I had open to do it, so we made an Italian beef expedition out of it, hitting both those places and more, eating only as much of each sandwich as seemed necessary to be able to write about it. Another one I wanted to try was <strong>The Patio</strong> on Taylor Street, and as long as we were there I thought we might as well establish a baseline and get a few pics at the original Al&#8217;s a few blocks east, so we started there. I don&#8217;t rank Al&#8217;s #1 but it&#8217;s clearly top-tier, and Myles really enjoyed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mgmax/14218767003" title="IMG_1278 by Mike Gebert, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7332/14218767003_bc9cefe4e6.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1278"></a><br />
<em>The Patio.</em></p>
<p>Commenters on the article plumped for The Patio but as far as I could see, its only merit is for people who think Al&#8217;s small, $7 or $8 sandwich isn&#8217;t enough food. For $6 at The Patio you get a bigger sandwich, but it has none of the spark that Al&#8217;s has— it&#8217;s a plain, fairly drab broth, and the meat is ordinary (but there&#8217;s lots of it!) Not top ten material, clearly.</p>
<p>Now, after the article came out people listed lots of their own choices in the comments. Some I flat out disagree with; Buona Beef isn&#8217;t much good at anything, and while Portillo&#8217;s is better, I still don&#8217;t think its beef is exciting enough to make a top ten, though I might give it a spot in the next ten. While the guy who suggested some place&#8217;s beef and cheddar croissant, well&#8230; One that really intrigued me, though, was <strong>Serrelli&#8217;s Food Mart</strong> in Elmwood Park. Now, being down the street from Johnnie&#8217;s may be as unpromising as being down the street from Al&#8217;s, but Serrelli&#8217;s is mainly an Italian grocery, and it&#8217;s primarily known for selling its premade Italian beef to people for their own parties at home— there are big tubs in the refrigerator case. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mgmax/14228818136" title="IMG_1495 by Mike Gebert, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5490/14228818136_f67de0a67b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1495"></a></p>
<p>That said, they also have a sandwich counter inside, so I ordered a beef there. I watched as the guy got out some fresh roast beef, portion controlled with white paper, and dropped it into the broth. A few minutes later:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mgmax/14175425356" title="IMG_1498 by Mike Gebert, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2912/14175425356_91f8138763.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1498"></a></p>
<p>The bread was good. The broth was as good as any in town, full of bright spice flavor. But the sandwich was done in by the unmistakable fact that the beef had just met the broth moments before; it had no real taste of its own. Admittedly, I was there at a very off-peak hour, which makes me think that this all might be better at lunchtime when the meat&#8217;s been in the juice for a while in anticipation of faster turnover. Even moreso, it&#8217;s probably better at home, when you make it and let it sit for a while. There&#8217;s promise here, for sure, but an IB from the counter at almost 3 p.m. was not a contender that day.</p>

<p><strong>TAVERN-CUT PIZZA</strong></p>

<p>There were only two pizzas I felt I needed to try, after trying so many <a href="http://skyfullofbacon.com/blog/?cat=387">Great Unknown Pizzas,</a> and only one was open for lunch, so I went to <strong>La Villa</strong>, which is just down the street from Smoque. (The other, as noted, was Villa Nova in Stickney, which made the list.) It&#8217;s really more of a banquet hall— there was a funeral lunch the day I went, but credit to our waitress for knowing how to keep a small order from getting lost behind the table of 30— and initially I was impressed by the pizza, which had a handmade, biscuity crust which was on the more substantial side of thin crust. </p>
<p>The problem was that after the crust, there just wasn&#8217;t much zip to this pizza. Both the sausage and the tomato sauce were too mild to make much of an impression. This wouldn&#8217;t be a bad pizza if it was your local delivery choice, but I can&#8217;t recommend it for any great distance of travel, which is essential to making a list like this.</p>

<p><strong>BARBECUE</strong></p>
<p>I actually had two barbecue lists in the works— one for Thrillist and one for Where Chicago which isn&#8217;t out yet— and of course I wanted them to be different in a way that was tailored to their respective audiences, so I&#8217;m not going to give away ones that didn&#8217;t make the former but did make the latter. Except that I do want to encourage people to check out one that made the latter list, which is <strong>Uncle J&#8217;s</strong> on 47th. If it sounds like Uncle John&#8217;s&#8230; yes, it&#8217;s his daughter and her family. Joe Roy turned it up in <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2014/04/uncle-johns-legacy-lives-on-in-richton-park-and-on-47th-street.html">this Serious Eats article</a> on the heirs to that beloved, now-closed BBQ spot, and I have to say, it&#8217;s awfully close. Maybe a touch Uncle John&#8217;s Lite, smokewise, but it jumps to being one of the best places that&#8217;s also pretty accessible (a pretty quick jaunt from 43rd on the Ryan). Anyway, the tips and links will bring you back pretty quickly to Uncle John&#8217;s (though that may not be so necessary; check out this intriguing <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=14&#038;t=40122&#038;p=476898&#038;hilit=vincennes#p476898">bit of intel</a> at LTHForum).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mgmax/14011957819" title="IMG_1320 by Mike Gebert, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/14011957819_10dffcfb5c.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1320"></a></p>
<p>And I&#8217;m going to put in a word for another place that didn&#8217;t make either list, but I think deserves more respect than it got by being stuck in a <a href="http://www.lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=18&#038;t=39944">bro-bashing train wreck of a thread at LTHForum,</a> which also takes <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/02/27/of-brisket-oysters-and-general-tsos-chicken-at-old-crow-smokehouse">Mike Sula&#8217;s review</a> as gospel, untried, which isn&#8217;t fair, I think. Admittedly, I had an unusual experience of <strong>Old Crow Smokehouse</strong> in Wrigleyville, which was that a PR rep and the chef stopped by my house with a box of things to try. (Curiously, they left off the Asian side of the menu that Sula describes entirely.) So take this hack plug with whatever tub of salt you want. But I thought the brisket and the smoked chicken were quite good, and I thought the housemade sauces had some real kick and complexity (I saved a couple of them for future use when the meat was all gone). The chef, a former steelworker turned midlife BBQ guy working long restaurant hours, has a good story, too (I wonder if a bit of the LTH antipathy has to do with perceived loyalty to a rival midlife BBQ guy). Anyway, if you actually try it for yourself and agree with Sula (who didn&#8217;t slam it as badly as some places), fair enough, but I think it deserves more of an actual trial than it seems to be getting. Again, we come back to Mike G&#8217;s Axiom of Modern BBQ: almost any BBQ place open right now would have been the best BBQ on the north side in the 1990&#8217;s.</p>

<p><strong>Boka.</strong> Well-off older people in Old Town and Lincoln Park have a new clubhouse and its name is Boka. Some might find a disconnect between Lee Wolen&#8217;s artful, slightly precious food and the more hipster room, which has the funky Tim Burtonesque touches of another Boka Group spot, Girl &#038; The Goat. But a packed, silver-haired Boka on a Saturday might be an argument that coherence is overrated; Avec has always had a disconnect for me between Italian-German comfort food and its severe Swedish sauna decor (and lack of comfort), and it&#8217;s taken that disconnect all the way to the bank. I suspect Boka will too, for a long time to come. </p>
<p>As at The Lobby, Wolen&#8217;s food is clean, precise modern food, executed flawlessly, that makes fairly classical flavors seem like they were just invented. Octopus in a pork broth that, as Mike Sula said, would make a great bowl of ramen (below); delicate yet muscular loup de mer (above) with artichokes and olives; his celebrated roasted chicken with brioche under the skin— there are resemblances to Izard&#8217;s hit-all-the-flavor-receptors-at-once approach, especially since every dish has its spot of citrus for a sweet note (which gets a bit expected when you try everything, like I did), but it&#8217;s all much subtler, more contained. You have to look at the menu description to see how complex the dishes can be, and that, rarely, there&#8217;s never anything on the plate that&#8217;s just there to fill you up— every vegetable, every little bit of something green, is in there for a clear reason in the conception of the dish&#8217;s overall flavor. (It has to be the fewest starches I can remember seeing on plates like these, ever.) </p>
<p>Once or twice a dish seemed to lack pop— I wanted more briny rusticness from the salt cod ravioli— but mostly you admire what he can do within the bounds of restraint and a dish plated in a neat little circle. Nobody colors within his own lines better at the moment than Wolen. The kitchen was a little slow on a packed Saturday night, but the room full of people happy to be there didn&#8217;t seem especially concerned by it. Disclosure: we dined like real people, but I was known to them, not least because I had <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/04/03/boka-chef-lee-wolen-im-a-simple-eater">just interviewed Wolen</a>, and he comped us to a complete set of the available desserts. I also attended Boka&#8217;s <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/04/29/happy-tenth-to-boka-group-alinea-back-in-top-ten-and-other-food-news">10th anniversary party.</a> On the other hand, Wolen, and especially Boka partners Kevin Boehm and Rob Katz, seemed to know a lot of people there that night, so that probably was close to a typical experience&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Homestead.</strong> The rooftop restaurant above Roots Handmade Pizza has promoted its previous #2, Chip Davies. The menu still looks a lot like Chris Curren&#8217;s, with some dishes carried over or evolved, but what I liked best was the new spin Davis brought to many of the dishes, of middle-eastern flavors and ingredients such as green almonds (which could have been favas if I hadn&#8217;t been told). The middle-eastern tinge gives Homestead something distinctive to hold onto as it otherwise serves up nicely comfy kind-of-rustic-Italian dishes like the orecchiete with smoked oxtails, or roasts a chicken but puts it in a tagine broth with golden raisins, which you might see anywhere otherwise. If we ever have a nice day and people can sit on its patio, it will be exactly the sort of unpretentious summer neighborhood restaurant experience that everyone hopes for in Chicago. Chris Teixeira&#8217;s desserts seem a bit too fancy for the room, but hey, disconnects and all that; I admire that he keeps the sweetness damped down and the combination of a chocolate one and a carrot one, after the rustic food, was pretty great. Disclosure: this was a media dinner, which my son and I attended. </p>

<p><strong>Les Miserables.</strong> As long as I&#8217;m disclosing, the same son and I went as guests on opening night to Drury Lane&#8217;s new production of Les Miserables, after seeing the movie some months back. 20 years ago, I saw it at the Auditorium Theater, from about six blocks away it felt like, and watching the famous revolving stage moving from that distance had all the excitement of watching a chair swivel. Better seats and a more intimate production made this a far more satisfying experience, a thoroughly professional one (led by a Valjean, Ivan Rutherford, who had been in the Broadway production&#8217;s long run and done it 2000 times around the country by now, and is, shall we say, very comfortable in the role), where the focus was on the actors over the (handsome but not overly expensive) setting. The slickly pro cast had two particular standouts, Mark David Kaplan giving the rogue Thenardier more humor and rascally charm than Sasha Baron Cohen&#8217;s muggy performance in the movie, and the one major example of race-neutral casting, Quentin Earl Darrington as a most ominous Javert, a regular Darth Javert in stentorian James Earl Jones-tones that set Javert even more apart from the citizens in the story.</p>

<p><strong>Isla Pilipina.</strong> I went to Isla Pilipina in <a href="http://lthforum.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=399">a rather memorably titled LTH post</a> many years ago, but hadn&#8217;t returned until almost a decade later when we went with some friends, who had just visited the Phillippines. Anyway, it is a very different place a decade later, much more professional in the manner of any well-run, well-packaged Asian restaurant, and packed on Saturday night. We ordered tons of food (with kids, there were eight of us), including two 20-piece orders of lumpia (devoured almost entirely by the kids), funky kare-kare (oxtail and green beans in peanut sauce), lechon kawali (deep-fried pork belly with a kind of gravy), fried chicken, grilled sirloin with a Filipino marinade tinge, garlic rice, pancit noodles and more (the spaghetti with hot dogs in it, which the kids were enthused about based on description, came late and went untouched, alas). Anyway, suffice it to say that it will not be another 10 years, and Isla Pilipina quickly zoomed to where it should have been all along on my list of Asian neighborhood gems.</p>

<p><strong>Paco&#8217;s Tacos.</strong> When I put Zacatacos on a Thrillist list of south side places, several people suggested Paco&#8217;s Tacos instead. But a year or so ago, for a Grub Street list, I had tried the two back to back and it was no contest. Titus of Tweets of Taco said, you need to go to the original Paco&#8217;s, inside a supermercado. So I gave it a try. We stood in a good-sized line. A guy behind us seemed to be talking legal advice for his crew on his cellphone, or maybe that was our recent <em>Breaking Bad</em>-viewing coloring the conversation. We got our tacos. He&#8217;s right, these are much better than other Paco&#8217;s, and rank highly among south side steak tacos. Still think I&#8217;d pick Zacatacos first, but always worth knowing another one.</p>

<p><strong>Taqueria Coacoyula.</strong> I spotted this place driving down Fullerton and thought it said it offered breakfast tacos, which would be a great find if true (and good). I must have conflated the signage, which does reference breakfast on weekends but not tacos. Still, I gave it a try at lunch, paying 50 cents extra for hand made tortillas. And I would still rate it a find, making very satisfying salty steak tacos in chewy, delectable freshmade tortillas, and doing a nice job on pastor tacos even without a cone (but lots of pineapple tossed in). That stretch of Fullerton (Austin to Cicero or so) is full of good things worth exploring, including <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2014/02/el-azteca-steak.html?ref=title">this steak place</a>, <a href="http://chicago.seriouseats.com/2014/01/el-huarache-de-maria.html?ref=title">this modest comida</a>, the tacos de canasta at La Chilangueada and more.</p>

<p><strong>Detroit Kabob House.</strong> Cathy Lambrecht and my kids and I tried to go here once after she did a canning demo for their 4-H chapter, and they chased us out 15 minutes before closing. But we tried again at lunch recently and got a decidedly better welcome, and I&#8217;m glad we went back. They don&#8217;t use charcoal like some of the Bridgeview-area middle eastern places (or ones in Detroit, that is, Dearborn), but even on gas grill, they did a terrific job grilling kebobs and other meats. I was less excited by the sides— baba ghanoush was fine, Jerusalem salad kind of a mess— but it&#8217;s a definite stop along the Niles stretch of Milwaukee for some simply, expertly grilled meats.</p>
