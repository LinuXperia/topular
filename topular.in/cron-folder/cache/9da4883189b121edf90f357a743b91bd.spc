Remote working is a significant trend in the US workplace, and it’s changing not only the way we work but the way we live, as well.  In new construction and renovations alike, making home offices that are more functional and appealing to use is a growing trend.

<a href="http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics">GlobalWorkplaceAnalytics.com</a> reports that 2.5% of all employees now work at home at least half the time, and 20-25% work at home some of the time. 22% of the self-employed population works at home. That’s an estimated 3.5 to 4 million working at home full or at least half time and another 28 million working at home less than half time.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1221" alt="Your Home’s Changing Role as a Workplace and Income Source" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/02/your-homes-changing-role-as-a-workplace-and-income-source-2.png" width="500" height="483" />

Employees support this trend, as <i>“80-90% of the US workforce says they would like to telework at least part time.” </i>

As remote working becomes more prevalent, the need for home offices becomes more pressing. A remote worker may not be working in the corporate headquarters, but they still have to do their work <i>somewhere. </i>The <a href="http://www.aia.org/press/releases/AIAB107953">American Institute of Architects</a> lists <i>“Need for space devoted to home offices, reflecting changing work patterns” </i>as one of their top 10 residential design trends for the next 10 years.

Better-designed home office spaces allow those who spend many hours working at home to be productive instead of “making do” in a common area, such as a kitchen table.  Among households with kids under 18 present, having a separate, well-designed office area can allow the worker to concentrate more effectively.

To be sure, while shared office spaces are a popular trend with Millennials as evidenced by <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2014/11/05/the-rise-of-wework/#2d26d6c28c11">WeWork</a> and other sources, the reality is when kids are present, schedules are tight, and commuting to an office, whether shared or other, takes time away from family.  And conducting phone calls and meetings in common areas (such as the kitchen) with young children present is challenging.  One dual career couple in Chicago designed their new home with two home offices (one for each person), as well as three bedrooms (two children and master).

President of <a href="http://www.zooinajungle.com">Zoo in a Jungle Marketing</a> Amanda Cullen recently completed a 500 square foot addition to her home in Cincinnati, OH. A large reason for this renovation was to expand her home office space. She explains:
<blockquote><i>“I run my business completely from my home office. As my business expanded, my company outgrew the spare bedroom previously used for the office. Designing a new office from the blueprint up allowed me to optimize the space, including a welcoming area where I can meet with clients instead of meeting at a local coffee shop.”</i></blockquote>
<h2>Boomer Entrepreneurs Need Space to Work, Too</h2>
Beyond telecommuters and entrepreneurs, retiring Boomers are also influencing the home office trend. Many anticipate an “encore career,” including the opportunity to work at home and be self-employed. According to the study <a href="http://familiesandwork.org/downloads/WorkinginRetirement.pdf"><i>Working In Retirement</i></a>:
<blockquote><i>“75% of workers aged 50 and older expect to have retirement jobs in the future…. A significant number of employees transition to self-employment for their retirement job…. In fact, nearly a third of those working for someone else in their pre-retirement job became their ‘own boss’ when they transitioned to retirement jobs.”</i></blockquote>
Ann Carrns writes in <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/boomers-near-retirement-changing-housing-trends/"><i>The Seattle Times</i></a>:
<blockquote><i>“A wave of retirements among baby boomers in the coming decades will have a big impact on residential real estate, in ways that are upending some conventional assumptions. Baby boomers are working longer or opting for ‘phased’ retirements, in which they work at least part time after leaving their primary careers.”</i></blockquote>
<i> </i>Lynne Snead of Coarsegold, CA provides <a href="http://encore.org/story/lynne-snead/">one story</a> of the newly self-employed retiree:
<blockquote><i>“At age 47, the company where I was a vice president, decided to eliminate the division of the company I was a part of. I had spent 15 years as a project management consultant, trainer and author but it was time for a change. I then obtained a graduate degree in Corporate Coaching and certifications as a behavioral and axiological analyst. I started a consulting practice providing assessments and coaching to organizations to assist with talent selection and leadership development. Now I do most of my work from my home office via phone and computer.”</i></blockquote>
Aging Boomers are enjoying the financial benefits and personal fulfillment of their “encore” entrepreneurship.   Senior living communities also need to adjust their offerings to accommodate home office spaces. This competitive industry needs to stay apace of Boomer lifestyles to stay relevant in the marketplace. Recent offerings in the industry indicate that senior living communities are striving to stay competitive.

One industry trend concerns offerings surrounding technology that enables independence. From <a href="http://www.seniorhomes.com/p/senior-living-communities/">SeniorHomes</a>:
<blockquote><i>“Independent living is at the top of the list for most seniors and most are serious about technology. That means that senior living communities must offer state-of-the-art systems for computer-savvy seniors. Those leaving the workforce today have become accustomed to and very adept at building their careers and a portion of their personal lives around computers. Seniors want services available that will allow them to maintain independence.”</i></blockquote>
Stepping up their technology, educational and common space offerings could pave the way for these communities to also start investing in office space for residents.

From Gen X and Millennial families defining their own career paths to Boomers with post-retirement, home-based businesses, working at home has become more popular and socially acceptable. The home office is changing from a secondary space used infrequently to an important living and work space in millions of homes.  Homes are increasingly used as income sources, whether as work spaces or with renting out space through airBnB, and this creates opportunity. Brands in this space need to anticipate these market changes and innovate to meet them.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Michal Clements";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7069:"<h2>How 32 Million Americans ‘Working at Home’ is Changing Our Lives and Living Spaces</h2>

Organic has been a food trend for many years, and most food brands have a market strategy perspective on the issue, ranging from actively dismissing organic to embracing it wholeheartedly. Just as the “natural” market starts to settle down, a new popular trend has emerged: Non-GMO.

Although Organic foods are, by necessity, Non-GMO, buying trends suggest that consumers may be on the path to prioritizing Non-GMO offerings over Organic ones. Consumers consider both Non-GMO and Organic to be “Natural” choices, as shown in this chart:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1209" alt="How Smuckers and Similac Navigate Non-GMO vs. Organic Brand Strategies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/01/how-smuckers-and-similac-navigate-non-gmo-vs-organic-brand-strategies-2.jpg" width="500" height="647" />

At present, Organic and Non-GMO are basically tied for shelf space and consumer preference, but Non-GMO appears to be the growing trend. Jacob Bunge <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/organic-vs-non-gmo-labels-whos-winning-1449619118">writes</a> in <i>The Wall Street Journal:</i>
<blockquote><i>“Last year, foods labeled non-GMO claimed 3.7% of total food sales in U.S. grocery stores, more than the 3.5% for organic items, according to market-research firm </i><a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/NLSN"><i>Nielsen</i></a><i> NV. About 49% of consumers polled by Nielsen called non-GMO an important factor in food-and-beverage shopping, versus 47% for organic.”</i></blockquote>
Non-GMO foods at retail are currently selling at five times the rate of Organic items, as highlighted in the same <i>Wall Street Journal </i>article:
<blockquote><i>“Non-GMO sales soared by an average of about 70% annually from 2013 through this year, and are expected to top $13 billion this year. That is five times the rate for food tracked by Spins that bears the organic seal, sales of which total nearly $11 billion for the 52 weeks ended Nov 1. The Spins data don’t include sales from </i><a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/WFM"><i>Whole Foods Market</i></a><i> Inc., a major seller of both categories.”</i></blockquote>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1208" alt="How Smuckers and Similac Navigate Non-GMO vs. Organic Brand Strategies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/01/how-smuckers-and-similac-navigate-non-gmo-vs-organic-brand-strategies-1.jpg" width="500" height="756" />

If consumer demand increases for Non-GMO over Organic products, brands may be only too happy to meet this demand. Organic certification is highly-regulated and fairly arduous. However, Non-GMO isn’t regulated by the federal government, and certification is conducted by private organizations, such as the Non-GMO Project.

One supplier is certainly seeing growth in demand for Non-GMO ingredients, as written about in <a href="http://civileats.com/2015/07/07/can-the-ingredient-supply-chain-keep-up-with-the-non-gmo-tsunami/">Civil Eats</a>:
<blockquote><i>“Rick Robbins, general manager at Colorado Mills, which processes sunflower oil, sees steadily growing interest in sunflower as a non-GMO alternative. ‘From what we hear, companies are being asked by their customers: are you using non-GMO products?’  He said, ‘Non-GMO is becoming as important as organic.’”</i></blockquote>
According to Ken Roseboro, Editor, <a href="http://non-gmoreport.com">Organic and Non-GMO Report</a>, companies are more aware of past Organic and Non-GMO supply issues that could hamper market growth:
<blockquote><i>“Both Non-GMO and Organic markets will continue to grow. And we’re starting to see initiatives to ramp up supply of Organic and Non-GMO crops here in the US. There have been shortages, and we’ve had to import a lot of organic corn from Romania and soybeans from India, China and South America. As bigger companies start offering more Non-GMO products, the supply chain will grow and prices for non-GMO raw materials will decrease. For instance, today, only 8% of soybeans grown in the US are Non-GMO, and supply is limited.”</i></blockquote>
With shifting demand and changing consumer awareness, should brands focus on Organic or Non-GMO brand strategies? Roseboro mentions that Smuckers and Similac are brands increasing their emphasis on Non-GMO and Organic offerings. Let’s take a look at how these brands navigate the complex natural market.
<h2>Smucker’s Deploys Natural and Organic Line Extensions</h2>
The J.M. Smucker Company, with its Smucker’s and Jif brands, offers both Non-GMO and Organic peanut butters, with an emphasis on Non-GMO “Natural” products.  It also has a line of Non-GMO fruit spreads, touted as “Made with Ingredients from Natural Sources.” As you can see, there’s quite an array of choices:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1210" alt="How Smuckers and Similac Navigate Non-GMO vs. Organic Brand Strategies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/01/how-smuckers-and-similac-navigate-non-gmo-vs-organic-brand-strategies.png" width="500" height="362" />

Smucker’s and Jif seem to be headed towards a “Natural” Non-GMO brand strategy, while evaluating the success of the Smucker’s Organic products. Note that the company doesn’t have any Organic Jif or fruit spread offerings.
<h2>Similac Pursues a Channel Strategy with Non-GMO and Organic Infant Formula</h2>
Abbott Laboratories, top producer of infant formula in the U.S., has offered Similac Organic since 2006. Even though the organic product is already Non-GMO, Abbott started selling Similac Advance Non-GMO in Target stores in May 2015. Abbott general manager Chris Calamari comments in the New York Times:
<blockquote><i>“‘We listen to moms and dads, and they’ve told us they want a non-G.M.O. option,’ said Chris Calamari, general manager of Abbott’s pediatric nutrition business. ‘We want to make sure we meet the desires of parents…. Over one-third of consumers say it would have appeal to them and give them peace of mind.’”</i></blockquote>
Similac Organic is priced somewhat higher than Similac Advance Non-GMO. Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save offers the formula varieties for $1.13/oz. and $1.11/oz., respectively. Reviewers also point out that the Non-GMO formula is less expensive if purchased at Target. Besides being a more economical option, Similac Advance Non-GMO is formulated to be more similar to breast milk.

Abbott’s channel strategy shows that the company is responding to increasing demand for Non-GMO offerings, but hasn’t decidedly chosen a side in the Non-GMO vs. Organic debate.

A large, established brand like Smucker’s or Similac can offer both Non-GMO and Organic products, either through increased shelf space or channel strategies.

Organic has been a food trend for many years, and most food brands have a market strategy perspective on the issue, ranging from actively dismissing organic to embracing it wholeheartedly. Just as the “natural” market starts to settle down, a new popular trend has emerged: Non-GMO.

Although Organic foods are, by necessity, Non-GMO, buying trends suggest that consumers may be on the path to prioritizing Non-GMO offerings over Organic ones. Consumers consider both Non-GMO and Organic to be “Natural” choices, as shown in this chart:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1209" alt="How Smuckers and Similac Navigate Non-GMO vs. Organic Brand Strategies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/01/how-smuckers-and-similac-navigate-non-gmo-vs-organic-brand-strategies-2.jpg" width="500" height="647" />

At present, Organic and Non-GMO are basically tied for shelf space and consumer preference, but Non-GMO appears to be the growing trend. Jacob Bunge <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/organic-vs-non-gmo-labels-whos-winning-1449619118">writes</a> in <i>The Wall Street Journal:</i>
<blockquote><i>“Last year, foods labeled non-GMO claimed 3.7% of total food sales in U.S. grocery stores, more than the 3.5% for organic items, according to market-research firm </i><a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/NLSN"><i>Nielsen</i></a><i> NV. About 49% of consumers polled by Nielsen called non-GMO an important factor in food-and-beverage shopping, versus 47% for organic.”</i></blockquote>
Non-GMO foods at retail are currently selling at five times the rate of Organic items, as highlighted in the same <i>Wall Street Journal </i>article:
<blockquote><i>“Non-GMO sales soared by an average of about 70% annually from 2013 through this year, and are expected to top $13 billion this year. That is five times the rate for food tracked by Spins that bears the organic seal, sales of which total nearly $11 billion for the 52 weeks ended Nov 1. The Spins data don’t include sales from </i><a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/WFM"><i>Whole Foods Market</i></a><i> Inc., a major seller of both categories.”</i></blockquote>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1208" alt="How Smuckers and Similac Navigate Non-GMO vs. Organic Brand Strategies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/01/how-smuckers-and-similac-navigate-non-gmo-vs-organic-brand-strategies-1.jpg" width="500" height="756" />

If consumer demand increases for Non-GMO over Organic products, brands may be only too happy to meet this demand. Organic certification is highly-regulated and fairly arduous. However, Non-GMO isn’t regulated by the federal government, and certification is conducted by private organizations, such as the Non-GMO Project.

One supplier is certainly seeing growth in demand for Non-GMO ingredients, as written about in <a href="http://civileats.com/2015/07/07/can-the-ingredient-supply-chain-keep-up-with-the-non-gmo-tsunami/">Civil Eats</a>:
<blockquote><i>“Rick Robbins, general manager at Colorado Mills, which processes sunflower oil, sees steadily growing interest in sunflower as a non-GMO alternative. ‘From what we hear, companies are being asked by their customers: are you using non-GMO products?’  He said, ‘Non-GMO is becoming as important as organic.’”</i></blockquote>
According to Ken Roseboro, Editor, <a href="http://non-gmoreport.com">Organic and Non-GMO Report</a>, companies are more aware of past Organic and Non-GMO supply issues that could hamper market growth:
<blockquote><i>“Both Non-GMO and Organic markets will continue to grow. And we’re starting to see initiatives to ramp up supply of Organic and Non-GMO crops here in the US. There have been shortages, and we’ve had to import a lot of organic corn from Romania and soybeans from India, China and South America. As bigger companies start offering more Non-GMO products, the supply chain will grow and prices for non-GMO raw materials will decrease. For instance, today, only 8% of soybeans grown in the US are Non-GMO, and supply is limited.”</i></blockquote>
With shifting demand and changing consumer awareness, should brands focus on Organic or Non-GMO brand strategies? Roseboro mentions that Smuckers and Similac are brands increasing their emphasis on Non-GMO and Organic offerings. Let’s take a look at how these brands navigate the complex natural market.
<h2>Smucker’s Deploys Natural and Organic Line Extensions</h2>
The J.M. Smucker Company, with its Smucker’s and Jif brands, offers both Non-GMO and Organic peanut butters, with an emphasis on Non-GMO “Natural” products.  It also has a line of Non-GMO fruit spreads, touted as “Made with Ingredients from Natural Sources.” As you can see, there’s quite an array of choices:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1210" alt="How Smuckers and Similac Navigate Non-GMO vs. Organic Brand Strategies" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2016/01/how-smuckers-and-similac-navigate-non-gmo-vs-organic-brand-strategies.png" width="500" height="362" />

Smucker’s and Jif seem to be headed towards a “Natural” Non-GMO brand strategy, while evaluating the success of the Smucker’s Organic products. Note that the company doesn’t have any Organic Jif or fruit spread offerings.
<h2>Similac Pursues a Channel Strategy with Non-GMO and Organic Infant Formula</h2>
Abbott Laboratories, top producer of infant formula in the U.S., has offered Similac Organic since 2006. Even though the organic product is already Non-GMO, Abbott started selling Similac Advance Non-GMO in Target stores in May 2015. Abbott general manager Chris Calamari comments in the New York Times:
<blockquote><i>“‘We listen to moms and dads, and they’ve told us they want a non-G.M.O. option,’ said Chris Calamari, general manager of Abbott’s pediatric nutrition business. ‘We want to make sure we meet the desires of parents…. Over one-third of consumers say it would have appeal to them and give them peace of mind.’”</i></blockquote>
Similac Organic is priced somewhat higher than Similac Advance Non-GMO. Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save offers the formula varieties for $1.13/oz. and $1.11/oz., respectively. Reviewers also point out that the Non-GMO formula is less expensive if purchased at Target. Besides being a more economical option, Similac Advance Non-GMO is formulated to be more similar to breast milk.

Abbott’s channel strategy shows that the company is responding to increasing demand for Non-GMO offerings, but hasn’t decidedly chosen a side in the Non-GMO vs. Organic debate.

A large, established brand like Smucker’s or Similac can offer both Non-GMO and Organic products, either through increased shelf space or channel strategies. Clearly, with the market still undecided if Non-GMO or Organic will prevail, the best market strategy is to offer both options to consumers. But for smaller brands, offering both might not be feasible. Stores might not provide the shelf space. Or becoming certified for and manufacturing two niche lines could be cost-prohibitive.  If you’re a smaller brand, do careful research before choosing your Natural strategy.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, my thoughts are turning more frequently to cooking and meal preparation.  In 2013, I had the pleasure of sharing consumer insights trends with the Butterball team, who had just <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/meet-butterballs-turkey-talk-line-men-20899320">welcomed the first men</a> as official brand spokespersons.

The Butterball brand recognized that 1 in 4 callers to the Turkey Talk-Line are men, and men are becoming increasingly involved in cooking. Some studies report that men love to cook more than women and that their favorite cooking method is to use the grill (while women prefer the oven).

<h2>Men More Involved in Cooking and Food Shopping Year-Round</h2>
These Thanksgiving insights tie into a year-round trend of men’s increasing involvement in food shopping and meal preparation.

There are a number of data points that support men’s increased involvement in shopping and cooking. For example, one study found that Gen X men go grocery shopping more than once a week and cook eight meals per week, which is much more than their fathers did.  The grocery store, <a href="https://nourish.schnucks.com">Schnuck’s</a>, found 6% more men as Primary Grocery Shopper (PGS) when compared to five years previously.

Cooking shows are very popular with both genders, with the Food Network estimating that men made up 42% of their viewing audience. Food ranks third behind sports and tech in terms of dad’s favorite information topic.

None of this is meant to infer that men are doing more of this than women, but the trend is increasing.
<h2>Cooking Among Retirees Is a Priority</h2>
Cooking in family households with kids at home is challenging, with time constraints, conflicting schedules (e.g., evening extracurriculars and sports for kids), and a number of mouths to feed (with competing food and taste preferences).   However, in retiree households, once the time constraints are lifted a bit, <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/lb/en/insights/news/2014/more-time-at-home-equates-to-more-time-in-the-kitchen-for-retire.html">Nielsen data shows</a> that more time is spent preparing meals and that the social dimension of entertaining can come to the fore. Nielsen Senior Vice President, Consumer &amp; Shopper Insights Todd Hale comments:
<blockquote><i>“When thinking about the shopping needs of an older demographic, we can forget that seniors live active social lives and enjoy entertaining with family and friends. A closer look at their shopping baskets reveals golden opportunities for marketers to better align products and services with not just their nutritional and medical needs, but their social desires too.”</i></blockquote>
<h2>Boomer Men Gear Up for Cooking Adventure</h2>
With Boomers increasingly moving into retirement (current ages are 50-69), many Boomer men are starting to take up cooking. Men’s approach is to spend a bit more time, with men more likely than women to spend “as long as it takes, 40 minutes or more” when preparing a meal. Men view preparing meals as an adventure, as described by Barry Calpino:
<blockquote><i>“Now they'll talk about cooking like guys would talk about a hobby 20 years ago. It's an adventure, it's an experience, it's fun, they talk about 'their signature.'"</i></blockquote>
And men also feel more relaxed about the outcome, according to Robin Ross, Associate Director or Culinary at Kraft:
<blockquote><i>“Men feel they have more latitude as cooks. Women want to please their families and for everyone to like what they make. Men have more of a free hand.”</i></blockquote>

In <a href="http://www.tuningintomom.com"><i>Tuning into Mom: Understanding America’s Most Powerful Consumer</i></a>, we explore how many moms use the strategy of “hiding” vegetables in homemade meals and also purchase pre-made products like Pirate’s Veggie Booty to increase vegetable consumption among their children.  This was such a common strategy among moms that we titled the chapter on Food “Stealth Veggies and Panini Making.” Recent <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/51200504_Vegetables_by_stealth._An_exploratory_study_investigating_the_introduction_of_vegetables_in_the_weaning_period">research confirms</a> that hiding vegetables continues to be one of mom’s most common strategies.

Do school cafeterias use this same strategy to meet nutritional guidelines and help students eat more vegetables? My research shows that stealth veggies in schools are actually fairly controversial.
<h2>Some Schools Love Hidden Vegetables</h2>
Historically, many schools have followed a <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2013/11/08/school-lunch-vendors-show-off-gourmet-goodies/3478831/">similar strategy</a> as Mom to increase vegetable consumption in their meals, for instance, by blending squash into spaghetti sauce or hiding legumes within the meat in burritos.

A typical comment from a Food Service/Nutrition Director in California:
<blockquote><i>“We already do that (hidden vegetables) and do that for years, we are the guinea pig for that. Like in our pizza, the onions and bell peppers were on top but now they are in the sauce and the kids don’t know they aren’t getting it.”  </i></blockquote>
In addition to blending in vegetables at the school, K-12 foodservice suppliers also offer popular foods with added vegetables.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1195" alt="‘Stealth Veggies’ Are Good Enough for Mom, But May Not Cut the Mustard in School Cafeterias" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2015/11/stealth-veggies-are-good-enough-for-mom-2.png" width="264" height="202" />One example is Uno Foods sweet potato-infused pizza crust.  Or consider American Pride’s “Whole Grain Sweet Potato Alaskan Pollock Nuggets.” These are fish nuggets with a sweet potato crunchy coating.  In addition to adding vegetable content, a K-12 foodservice director mentioned that the sweet potato crust on the fish actually made the students like the product more. This is a win-win where the hidden vegetable enhances the taste and adds nutrition.

One Food Service/Nutrition Director in Massachusetts says:
<blockquote><i>“It’s out of this world delicious. Fish is a hard sell, and when you get something that makes the fish appealing, it really helps.  It’s done well for us.”</i></blockquote>
<h2>Against Hidden Vegetables in Schools</h2>
But not all school food service and nutrition directors agree with Mom about stealth veggies.  In fact, another equally large group of food service directors are philosophically opposed to hidden vegetables, and also feel that hidden vegetables are not in line with the latest government guidelines.  By our estimates, this group is as much as 50% of directors.

Says one New York Food Service/Nutrition Director:
<blockquote><i>“I tend not to like the hidden vegetables, because kids need to know what they are eating. Hidden vegetables aren’t the answers. The state and federal guidelines are more whole and fresh.”</i></blockquote>
In Kansas, another director agrees:
<blockquote><i>“No reason to hide vegetables except to meet regulations.  The whole point is to get the youth to eat more fruits and vegetables as a lifestyle change, so when you hide the vegetables, that doesn’t really meet the objectives of them selecting more vegetables in their everyday life.” </i></blockquote>
<h2>The Bigger School Context for Hidden Vegetables</h2>
Regardless of how the school food service and nutrition director nets out on stealth vegetables, these individuals are juggling taste acceptance issues in light of national guidelines that can make the meal options in schools less tasty (e.g., whole wheat, reduced sodium).

Other topics that food service directors must consider are:
<ol>
	<li>Using more locally sourced, farm to table foods</li>
	<li>Doing more scratch cooking</li>
	<li>Modernizing their facilities</li>
	<li>More universal feeding (dinners, open sites).</li>
</ol>

Hidden vegetables, while potentially helpful or a deal breaker to individual directors, aren’t the top item on many school foodservice/nutrition director’s priority lists.

In <a href="http://www.tuningintomom.com"><i>Tuning into Mom: Understanding America’s Most Powerful Consumer</i></a>, we explore how many moms use the strategy of “hiding” vegetables in homemade meals and also purchase pre-made products like Pirate’s Veggie Booty to increase vegetable consumption among their children.  This was such a common strategy among moms that we titled the chapter on Food “Stealth Veggies and Panini Making.” Recent <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/51200504_Vegetables_by_stealth._An_exploratory_study_investigating_the_introduction_of_vegetables_in_the_weaning_period">research confirms</a> that hiding vegetables continues to be one of mom’s most common strategies.

Do school cafeterias use this same strategy to meet nutritional guidelines and help students eat more vegetables? My research shows that stealth veggies in schools are actually fairly controversial.
<h2>Some Schools Love Hidden Vegetables</h2>
Historically, many schools have followed a <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/2013/11/08/school-lunch-vendors-show-off-gourmet-goodies/3478831/">similar strategy</a> as Mom to increase vegetable consumption in their meals, for instance, by blending squash into spaghetti sauce or hiding legumes within the meat in burritos.

A typical comment from a Food Service/Nutrition Director in California:
<blockquote><i>“We already do that (hidden vegetables) and do that for years, we are the guinea pig for that. Like in our pizza, the onions and bell peppers were on top but now they are in the sauce and the kids don’t know they aren’t getting it.”  </i></blockquote>
In addition to blending in vegetables at the school, K-12 foodservice suppliers also offer popular foods with added vegetables.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1195" alt="‘Stealth Veggies’ Are Good Enough for Mom, But May Not Cut the Mustard in School Cafeterias" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2015/11/stealth-veggies-are-good-enough-for-mom-2.png" width="264" height="202" />One example is Uno Foods sweet potato-infused pizza crust.  Or consider American Pride’s “Whole Grain Sweet Potato Alaskan Pollock Nuggets.” These are fish nuggets with a sweet potato crunchy coating.  In addition to adding vegetable content, a K-12 foodservice director mentioned that the sweet potato crust on the fish actually made the students like the product more. This is a win-win where the hidden vegetable enhances the taste and adds nutrition.

One Food Service/Nutrition Director in Massachusetts says:
<blockquote><i>“It’s out of this world delicious. Fish is a hard sell, and when you get something that makes the fish appealing, it really helps.  It’s done well for us.”</i></blockquote>
<h2>Against Hidden Vegetables in Schools</h2>
But not all school food service and nutrition directors agree with Mom about stealth veggies.  In fact, another equally large group of food service directors are philosophically opposed to hidden vegetables, and also feel that hidden vegetables are not in line with the latest government guidelines.  By our estimates, this group is as much as 50% of directors.

Says one New York Food Service/Nutrition Director:
<blockquote><i>“I tend not to like the hidden vegetables, because kids need to know what they are eating. Hidden vegetables aren’t the answers. The state and federal guidelines are more whole and fresh.”</i></blockquote>
In Kansas, another director agrees:
<blockquote><i>“No reason to hide vegetables except to meet regulations.  The whole point is to get the youth to eat more fruits and vegetables as a lifestyle change, so when you hide the vegetables, that doesn’t really meet the objectives of them selecting more vegetables in their everyday life.” </i></blockquote>
<h2>The Bigger School Context for Hidden Vegetables</h2>
Regardless of how the school food service and nutrition director nets out on stealth vegetables, these individuals are juggling taste acceptance issues in light of national guidelines that can make the meal options in schools less tasty (e.g., whole wheat, reduced sodium).

Other topics that food service directors must consider are:
<ol>
	<li>Using more locally sourced, farm to table foods</li>
	<li>Doing more scratch cooking</li>
	<li>Modernizing their facilities</li>
	<li>More universal feeding (dinners, open sites).</li>
</ol>
Districts vary greatly in the percent of students who eat free and reduced meals, the taste preferences of their students, the underlying enrollment of the area and meal participation, adding to the complexity of the picture.

<h2>What A Difference 5 Years Can Make</h2>
Often overlooked, however, is that during their 20s, Millennials transition through dramatically different lifestages.

By the time they are 25-29, fully 45% of women are married and another 17% are co-habitating, with 7% divorced, widowed or separated.  Only 31% are single. By comparison, at ages 20-24, almost two-thirds of women are single (61%). Men follow a similar pattern, with a slight delay so that the age of first marriage is 28 for men and 26 for women.

Marriage or living together changes many spending dynamics and may also impact the outlook on work.  The impression of the SNL skit is of younger MIllennials (20-24) who are interested primarily in themselves.

The ‘twenty-something’ depiction also ignores the large group of Millennials who are 30+, many of whom are parents. Having a child in the household is another huge milestone that can impact work outlook. In fact, the demographic reality is that the average age of a 1<sup>st</sup> time mom is currently 25, though this does differ by multi-cultural group.
<h2>Diverse Voices Being Drowned Out by General Market Research</h2>
General market research usually doesn’t account for these two factors:
<ol>
	<li>Millennials are more diverse than other generations</li>
	<li>Some of the most challenging folks to capture through broad scale market research are younger males, especially younger African Americans and Hispanics</li>
</ol>
It’s not that hard to get the voice of a Caucasian, suburban Gen X mom in her late 30’s or 40’s. And Baby Boomers are easier to reach, as well.   But to truly understand segments within the Millennial generation, more effort than pulling a general sample is needed. There are many important diverse voices.
<h2>Millennial Research Insights Example</h2>
Let’s look at a category-specific example. It’s been <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/02/04/millennials-convenience-stores-fast-food-restaurants/22872685/">widely reported</a> that Millennials have a different outlook on convenience store prepared foods than previous generations, and are now using them more frequently. Some of the reasons given for convenience stores’ popularity with Millennials include upgraded product offerings, reasonable prices and convenient fit with these impulse buyers.  This top-level understanding is a starting point.

<a href="http://www.itoaction.com">Insight to Action</a> had the privilege to work with a leading manufacturer of convenience store prepared foods who took the time to go to a deeper level of insights, understanding Millennials by multi-cultural group and by age range, as well as gender and working status.

It may not seem intuitive from the SNL skit, but older Millennials (25-34) are more committed, regular users of convenience stores prepared foods. Here’s some insight into why. If you think about the lifestyle of a 25-34 year old, working, married man, with or without kids, he is in an established job and work routine. That makes him more likely to eat lunch and breakfast away from home at convenience store(s) along his work commute or travel from job to job.

By comparison, the younger male or female Millennial ages 18-24 is less likely to work full-time, and more likely to be a student.  These younger consumers have more mixed opinions about convenience stores, with distinct attitudes towards convenience stores, along with their preferences for food types within the stores.  The insights go even deeper when considering Spanish vs. English speaking Hispanics, African American, and Asian American Millennials.

This type of highly proprietary information gives our client a competitive advantage, and the company is sharing it selectively with their customers, convenience store chains.

Too often, research studies call for ages 18-49 (which goes beyond Millennials) without paying attention to the differences between younger and older Millennials, among multi-cultural groups or relating to gender. So, when you see a generalized finding of Millennials, it’s worth taking the time to understand the points of commonality vs. differences within this large group.

That makes him more likely to eat lunch and breakfast away from home at convenience store(s) along his work commute or travel from job to job.

By comparison, the younger male or female Millennial ages 18-24 is less likely to work full-time, and more likely to be a student.  These younger consumers have more mixed opinions about convenience stores, with distinct attitudes towards convenience stores, along with their preferences for food types within the stores.  The insights go even deeper when considering Spanish vs. English speaking Hispanics, African American, and Asian American Millennials.

This type of highly proprietary information gives our client a competitive advantage, and the company is sharing it selectively with their customers, convenience store chains.

Too often, research studies call for ages 18-49 (which goes beyond Millennials) without paying attention to the differences between younger and older Millennials, among multi-cultural groups or relating to gender. So, when you see a generalized finding of Millennials, it’s worth taking the time to understand the points of commonality vs. differences within this large group.

<h2>Marketing to Kids – What Worked in the Past</h2>
A few years ago, my colleagues and I worked on a Kid’s Landmark Study for Good Humor Breyers, known for Popsicle, along with a number of other iconic kid brands..  At that time, the Popsicle brand marketing approach was to appeal directly to kids ages 6 and under.

In advertising, Popsicle focused on an 8-10 year old boy as the protagonist in most of spots. Industry wisdom held that, in these age ranges, boys are aspirational to girls, but girls are not aspirational to boys.  Another time-honored strategy was to feature a slightly older kid than the core target. This campaign was designed to speak to both boys and girls ages 6 and under. (Since that time, Popsicle has undoubtedly evolved its marketing strategy, with a <a href="http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7QnY/popsicle-the-truth-fairy-vs-the-tooth-fairy">recent spot</a> showing a boy and a tooth fairy.)
<h2>Marketing to Kids – Looking to Future Trends</h2>
Released November 2013, Disney’s <i>Frozen</i> has become a cultural institution.

The movie features female leads (Elsa and Anna) and their development, with male characters like Olaf the snowman (who likes warm hugs), Sven the reindeer, and Kristoff supporting their journey.   There’s even the double-crossing handsome male character, Hans, who is no Prince Charming.  With these female leads in mind, the assumption might be that <i>Frozen</i> is only aspirational to girls, and not to boys, in line with conventional thinking.

The movie’s influence continues on, since it is a favorite, and children tend to watch their favorite movies over and over.  In 2014, kid’s expert <a href="http://kidsay.com/four-insights-kids-favorite-movies/">KidSay Research reported</a> in its Trend Tracker that <i>Frozen</i> was the #1 movie (by far) among younger kids age 5-7 and also older kids age 8-15.

Not surprisingly, <i>Frozen</i>’s popularity was fueled by girls, with 46.3% of girls ages 5-7 naming <i>Frozen</i> as their favorite movie, compared with 2.7% of boys in the same age category.  Similarly, 19.4% of girls ages 8-15 said Frozen was their favorite, compared with 3.0% of boys.  Still, this means that a lot of younger brothers, and young boys are watching Frozen regularly, and enjoying it.

<i><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1178" alt="The Future of Marketing to Kids: How Disney’s ‘Frozen’ Won Over a Surprising Segment" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2015/10/how-disneys-frozen-won-over-a-surprising-segment-3.png" width="200" height="306" />Frozen</i> Halloween costumes were very popular last year. Disney <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/business/media/frozen-princess-dresses-are-hot-sellers-disney-says.html">reported</a> that 3 million <i>Frozen</i> role-play dresses (Elsa and Anna) were sold in 2014., and that these were hot sellers among girls.

Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that the <i>Frozen</i> story is appealing to young boys and is quite popular with them.  This insight was prompted when talking with Hispanic kindergarteners at the Los Angeles Elementary School, as part of the <a href="http://www.readingtokids.org/Home/main.php">Reading to Kids program</a>.  The two boys in my small group both reported that they will be Olaf this Halloween. And a search of Amazon reveals dozens of Olaf costume options and hundreds of customer reviews and pictures of boys aspiring to be Olaf.

Next, in talking with Amanda Cullen of <a href="http://www.zooinajungle.com">Zoo in a Jungle Marketing</a>, she mentioned that her twin sons, age 2, both demand Olaf underwear:
<blockquote><i>“I was surprised how emphatic they each were about Olaf when we went underwear shopping. They pushed aside options like Thomas the Tank Engine and Sesame Street, insisting on the ‘snowman!’ I guess I should have known, since ‘Do You Want to Build a Snowman?’ is one of their favorite songs.”</i></blockquote>
Another friend reported that her neighbor’s son, age four, attended a girl’s birthday party where all the girls were Disney princesses, and so he now has his own Elsa costume.

To be sure, young boys still enjoy traditional male favorites, like Star Wars’ Darth Vader and Batman, and the National Retail Federation <a href="https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/minions-star-wars-characters-costumes-abound-adults-children-and-pets-this">reports</a> these are top kids’ Halloween costumes this year (along with the addition of a new favorite: Minions).

Still, I am intrigued by <i>Frozen</i> and Olaf’s appeal, and wonder if this might suggest a change in boys’ attitudes and preferences. It’s a trend worth watching, and it seems marketing to kids might see some strategic changes in the near future.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Michal Clements";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5533:"Brands in the kids’ space have historically known how to appeal to both girls and boys using a particular set of market strategies and marketing tactics.

<h2>Beer Players In the Cider Market</h2>
Boston Beer Company is an industry leader with its Angry Orchard brand growing over 81% in 2014.  In 2015, the brand recently <a href="http://www.shankennewsdaily.com/index.php/2015/09/23/13405/angry-orchard-sees-drier-style-ciders-broadening-the-categorys-appeal/">announced</a> a drier style for “year round appeal,” with its Orchard Stone Dry. In 2013, In-Bev <a href="http://www.shankennewsdaily.com/index.php/2015/09/23/13405/angry-orchard-sees-drier-style-ciders-broadening-the-categorys-appeal/">began offering</a> its European style cider, Stella Cidre in the US.

Seeing this market growth, MillerCoors recently launched its own hard cider, <a href="http://smithandforgehardcider.com/#about">Smith &amp; Forge</a> in 2014. It’s described as “a sturdy drink for the hardy gent,” and the product’s initial press release and packaging highlight its “strength” and lack of overly sweet taste:
<blockquote><i>“Smith &amp; Forge is a hard cider fermented in the tradition of days gone by.  With a rich amber color, 6% alcohol by volume (ABV), a distinct, not-too-sweet taste and a fantastically crisp finish, Smith &amp; Forge is built to refresh.”</i></blockquote>
Vice President of Insights and Innovation David Kroll goes on to say:
<blockquote><i>“There was a time when more hard cider was consumed in America than beer.  Now hard cider is exploding again, but the sweetness of many current ciders can be a turn off to beer drinkers, and some of them are looking instead to spirits and crafts for variety. Smith &amp; Forge is a strong, just-sweet-enough hard cider that encourages guys to discover -- or rediscover -- the world of hard cider.”</i></blockquote>
Will products like Smith &amp; Forge prevent local orchards from success? Gowans doesn’t appear to be concerned about market threats from large brands because her orchard has the authenticity Millennials seek out. For over a century, Gowans Orchards has developed apple varieties that focus on flavor, compared to large commercial orchards optimizing for varieties that ripen more quickly or are more aesthetically pleasing.

The apple is certainly having a moment in alcoholic beverage trends.

Retailing expert and Waypoint Partners principal Judy Harrison has surprising research that proves otherwise. While developing growth strategies for a fashion apparel brand, Harrison found that women ages 15-25 divide into three primary segments—and fashion-forward women comprise the smallest group.

The larger segments want clothing that “fits my style” or are focused more on comfort.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1164" alt="Comfort Seekers? Fashion Apparel Retail Expert Identifies Surprising Millennial Consumer Segments" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/files/2015/09/comfort-seekers-fashion-apparel-2.png" width="400" height="534" />

Fashion Forward consumers are an important segment, with 15% of young women ages 15-25 strongly agreeing that they “spend time to keep up with the latest fashion trends,” or that “wearing the latest clothing is very important,” or that “my family and friends often ask my advice when it comes to style and fashion.”

By comparison, though, 41% of women in this age range find it “extremely important” that the clothing “fits my style.” That Millennials desire customization is well proven in other categories, such as <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/marketing-strategist/2015/08/bespoke-beverages-how-how-freal-and-coca-cola-freestyle-satisfy-millennial-cravings/">beverages</a>. What’s unusual about this finding is that young Millennial women in large numbers value clothing that “fits my style” more than following the latest trends.

Another surprising segment is that nearly a quarter of these female consumers ages 15-25 (23%) say they would “rather be more comfortable and less stylish.” Typical fashion market strategies don’t focus on comfort for women’s fashion unless targeting an older demographic. For instance, as reported in the <i><a href="http://www.wsj.com/article_email/millennial-fashion-grows-up-1440022806-lMyQjAxMTI1NTI1MDkyMzAwWj">Wall Street Journal</a></i>, retailer Forever 21 recently announced an “aging up” strategy to offer “more forgiving silhouettes” in an effort to appeal to older Millennials. But retailers like Forever 21 seem to miss that personal style and comfort as just as important to younger Millennial women.
<h2>What Fashion Consumers Value Most</h2>
And what is the #1 criteria for all three segments when deciding where to shop for clothing/fashion?  It’s “good value.” Good value isn’t only defined as ‘the lowest price.’ It is also defined as benefits divided by price.  Meaning, there are different formulas or ways to deliver value to each consumer group.

The market is crowded with retail brands that target the Fashion Forward or “Fast Fashion” market segment, but three stand out from the pack: Forever 21, H&amp;M and American Eagle.

Harrison explains the market opportunity that most retailers are disregarding:
<blockquote><i>“Forever 21, H&amp;M and American Eagle are ahead with the under 25 female consumer who wants fast fashion and styles that change constantly.  While all consumers want value, these brands deliver the specific value Fashion Forward consumers are looking for. Other retailers may be overlooking the large segments of consumers who want fashion that ‘fits my style’ or delivers on ‘comfort.’”</i></blockquote>
Although it makes up just 15% of women ages 15-25, the Fashion Forward segment is saturated with choices. Competition is fierce. Meanwhile, retailers appear to more or less ignore the Fits My Style segment (with 41% of the market) and Comfort Seeker segment (with 23%).

It seems that fashion retailers are missing great opportunity for growth in delivering to the unmet demands of customization, comfort and value. Why target the most competitive 15% of the market when you could go for 23%, or 41%?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Michal Clements";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4280:"Many fashion retail executives think their competitive edge with Millennials will be found in offering the latest fashion.

Recently, the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/back-to-school-shopping-is-a-digital-holdout-1440612119">WSJ highlighted</a> how back to school is still an in-person shopping experience for a variety of reasons: (1) children/young adults can pick the notebook that they like (2) the ritual of back to school shopping may help transition the child’s mindset towards school, (3) it’s just a time together that both mom and child enjoy.

This was certainly true for me. For the past fifteen years, I looked forward to back to school supply shopping with my children, somehow imagining that getting them the perfect school supplies would help them get off to a great start in the new academic year.  For me, there is something reassuring about school supplies; they instill a feeling of organization and confidence.

My daughter was proud of me and shared in the excitement.  As a strategy consultant, my work is often less tactical, so it’s fun to see the tangible results in market.

We debated several critical factors in planner selection, including vertical or horizontal organization, hourly vs. daily vs. weekly, size and many others.  In the end, the perfect planner was selected by my daughter.  On this trip, we didn’t buy any notebooks or binders, since her college is over 1000 miles away.  Sensing my sadness at the lack of the complete back to school supply shopping experience, my daughter consoled me by saying that the planner is the most important school supply, and that with the planner, she was ready for college.   I know she is ready. I just loved the ritual of going together and buying the color-coded notebooks and binders.
