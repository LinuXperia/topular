There are many things many of us women take for granted.

Some of us don’t take heed of what we have taken for granted until something drastic happens, that is, until our world is shaken upside down and life as we know it is no longer the same.

I’m one of those people.

I deal in extremes, so my fall was no <i>slip,</i> it was hard, great and devastating on all accounts. My fall wasn’t about love, sex, or money.

<b>What I lost was my peace of mind and it nearly cost me my life. </b>

Mental instability is on the taboo side of the fence for a Black woman like myself; it’s that thing ‘they’ struggle with, not us.

<b>Far too many of us are told to get a drink, get laid or pray our way through life’s tough spots.</b>

While any combination of those quick feel-good fixes can provide some relief, the root of the struggle must be addressed.

For me, anxiety and depression lurked under the surface for years, masked by lovers, by bottles of “social wine” and by the bedside alike. For years I was NOT okay, but I maintained a façade that “all was well.”

<b>In fact I was ready to quit it all and <i>never</i> surface again. </b>

Depression is a sneaky thing that attacks your mind, be it at work, before you doze off, in the shower, at dinner, anywhere!  Evil thoughts told me it’s all my fault and that I’ll never have what I want because of this or that.

Haunting thoughts and demeaning ideas provoked my anxiety to desire destructive things. I also feared starting something productive because of thoughts of failure;

<b>I was literally a prisoner of my own mind.</b>

<b>I turned to alcohol because it’s more socially accepted than therapy. </b>

<b>I</b> <b>turned to sex because it’s more relatable than yoga or holistic medication.</b>

I was going down the rabbit hole of despair, but something was pulling me out of it in the midst of this storm.

Something told me to fight for myself, like I’d fought for love. Like I’d fought for money or success.

<b>My spirit was telling me to fight for ME!</b>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LXJ8IDzdXpM" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

No one else encouraged me to fight my way out of this depression because no one knew my private battle.
<blockquote>I knew if I didn’t fight, I would die.</blockquote>
I stopped taking the meds for anxiety, and the pills for insomnia and then I stopped drinking.

I did everything cold turkey with nothing but a will to live.

I got deeper into yoga, prayer and meditation.

I cleaned my diet and added foods that promoted hormone health.

<b>I got honest with myself and those around me; </b>they were far more supportive than I thought they’d be and I was strong enough to go on if they weren’t.

<em>I expanded my vocab and stimulated my mind</em>.

<b>Today I’m sober, celibate and more grounded in self-love than I’ve ever been in my entire life.</b>

I hold a certain audacity to set and maintain a standard for my temple with the<b> inner peace of knowing that I’m worth everything I desire. </b>

This road is long and lonely but ever most fulfilling, for it is a journey that I’ve committed my life to. Mental health matters and should never be taken for granted.

Designer Ashley Chew, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, created a free hand purse stating “Black Models Matter”; which went completely viral.  As a fashion correspondent

at the 2016 New York Fashion Week, I was able to take a look at if the frequent shun of African American artists, such as recent actor and musician awards, continues to rear its ugly head in the fashion world?

Surprisingly New York Fashion week heard our cry and more black and biracial models with textured hair and voluptuous curves have walked the runways in 2016, than preceding years.

There has been an increased movement, this year, in the fashion world towards the inclusion of all shapes and colors. The fashion momentum continues even off the runway. Sports Illustrated recently made history by placing a plus-sized model, Ashley Graham, on its cover. Even more exciting, the magazine went one step further, with their reveal of the first plus–sized African American women, Precious Lee, in an advertisement that exudes confidence, poise and sexuality.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/blackmodelsmatter.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12616" alt="blackmodelsmatter" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/blackmodelsmatter-254x300.jpg" width="254" height="300" /></a>

While the fashion world has made great strides with embracing beautiful brown women in healthy body acceptance images; there is still more work to do. Unfortunately, style remains biased and one-sided and diversity is rare in the fashion and modeling industry. Black models are still feeling pressure to chemically straighten or wear their hair in European textured styles to be even considered for a model audition.

As we slowly progress towards an all-inclusive world, throughout all fields of work, I can’t help but be proud of the growth that has recently been made…..at least at New York Fashion week.

<p dir="ltr">I have two companies, both service the television and film industry, some call me a Superwoman.  I say, I’m just me.  And I've  had a lifetime of experiences that have encouraged me to be who I am today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I spend my days and nights working excessively.  Building an empire, taking care of my family, motivating others in various capacities.  It's a rewarding experience, you know; to inspire people. Positively contributing to others lives, is about what sums it up.</p>

<h1>Self-Destruction</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>For many years, I was sleepwalking.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a kid,I could see the value in earning money and making other people happy, I was a little hustler.  My sisters knew I always had money. Even before my first job at 15, if I wasn’t running grocery errands for the neighbors or buying boxes of Little Debbie snacks and selling them from my book bag, I was making money by doing my friends' makeup.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Let’s just say I was destined to not ever have a “dry pocket.”</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Seems all good, right?  But it wasn't.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> I had a tumultuous childhood and through that I didn’t know my self worth.</strong>  I sacrificed all of me for the sake of others. I learned a lot of things, but I was not taught how to love me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">See, even at that young age, <strong>I was making things happen for others,</strong> like I said, it’s so rewarding, <strong>but I was hiding something underneath my smile,</strong> my compassion, and my determination to have more out of life.  <strong>My secret: I was making that money to survive. I was a child, a teen mom, thinking about how to feed and take care of my family, my mom and sisters.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Do you really understand what kind of burden that responsibility has on a teenager?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I was raised in the church </strong>and I was blessed to learn how important having a spiritual relationship would be for my life. It carries me today.<strong> I was taught to give,give,give,</strong> with the <strong>expectation that I would receive “blessings” in return.</strong>  See, I spent my youth giving everything away and that included me--and I didn’t even realize it, until life hit me with a number of uppercuts and I lost everything.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>And when I looked around for help, no one was there.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">That was my wake-up call.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I started my first company <strong>Edit Talent Group</strong> back in 2003, I was serving a dual career in the television and cosmetics industries and I had my first degree by then.  I was married with four children, the house, and the cars. <strong>People called us the Black Ken and Barbie</strong>...funny but, I was dying on the inside.  Still, I gave and I gave and I gave like I did when I was a kid. <strong>Not truly understanding why was I giving away so much of me.</strong></p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Self-Neglect</h1>
<p dir="ltr">In 2005, my family unit was forever changed and it was then that I became a single mom with two careers, a house, cars and more….it wasn’t easy at all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And to top it all off, <strong>I gave away my professional freedom by putting my business on hold to support someone else's dream;</strong> I became the COO of a private label cosmetics company that was housed in a few Macy’s Department Stores in the Midwest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I took my job seriously and at that time I was in my Masters Program at Xavier University.  <strong>I was there for <em>her</em> growth</strong> <strong>and as I gave, gave and gave to this woman and her company, I lost everything of my own.  </strong>See, not only was I an employee, I became an owner with the hopes that I would positively benefit in return...you know, what I learned in the church, “give and you will receive” right?</p>
<p dir="ltr">But, nothing transpired….not only did I give away my time and my money, I gave away me!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I ended up running a company that wasn’t mine and I did it for FREE!</strong> I was an employee and a shareholder and not making one dime!</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">People asked, "Why do you stay?"  I would reply, "How can you walk away from something you’ve invested everything into?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">She promised me that I would get it all back with interest.  Did that happen? ABSOLUTELY NOT!</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was left broken, in debt and I had nearly $60,000 of uncashed paychecks  (every deposit would bounce).  I worked for FREE and it wasn’t my company! I put my business on hold to help someone else's dream and I was left with no support.</p>

<h1>Self-Worth</h1>
<p dir="ltr">I took a step back during my MBA program; we had an International Business class that required for me to travel to ASIA, and that gave me time to breathe, think, and to evaluate life. Ultimately, that trip helped me to make some wiser decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I came home brand new!</strong> I looked at the big picture, checked my net worth, saw what this experience was doing--not just to me, but to my children as well--and it made me sick!  I expected others to be there, but the truth is, <strong>I hadn’t expected that of myself.  </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Was this what I needed to finally see?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I began to feel vulnerable, transparent and vocal.  I was angry, I was tired! I worked my ass off and I’m looking at my situation thinking….<em>this</em> is not what you worked so hard for! I told myself, <em>"You are worth more than this; you have gifts, talents and a business that needs attention With your work experience, your education and your knowledge, YOU are a valuable woman!"</em></p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Self-Love</h1>
<p dir="ltr">You must look at yourself in the mirror and recognize that <strong>you were placed on this earth to change lives</strong> but how can you set an example, if you are not practicing what you preach?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was tired! I was tired of feeling broken.  I was tired of allowing others to take advantage of my worth.   I was tired of giving away what I didn’t have; and I was tired of feeling like a victim!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So, I walked away from the parasites--everything and everyone that was in my life to take advantage of my giving spirit--and it hurt!</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Today, I am a confident woman who demands what she is worth and doesn’t settle or accept anything less. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">My wakeup call was enough for me to get myself together and truly understand my purpose. (I remain a giver; but the difference is, I LOVE myself enough <strong>to understand my own worth,</strong> what makes me happy and how <strong>MY JOY</strong> adds value to the successes in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong>I had to choose my happiness and today, I encourage you to do the same. </strong></strong>Know your worth, and don’t allow parasites to distract you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LOVE yourself enough to win!</p>
<p dir="ltr">LOVE YOU!</p>

<p dir="ltr">I began to feel vulnerable, transparent and vocal.  I was angry, I was tired! I worked my ass off and I’m looking at my situation thinking….<em>this</em> is not what you worked so hard for! I told myself, <em>"You are worth more than this; you have gifts, talents and a business that needs attention With your work experience, your education and your knowledge, YOU are a valuable woman!"</em></p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Self-Love</h1>
<p dir="ltr">You must look at yourself in the mirror and recognize that <strong>you were placed on this earth to change lives</strong> but how can you set an example, if you are not practicing what you preach?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was tired! I was tired of feeling broken.  I was tired of allowing others to take advantage of my worth.   I was tired of giving away what I didn’t have; and I was tired of feeling like a victim!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So, I walked away from the parasites--everything and everyone that was in my life to take advantage of my giving spirit--and it hurt!</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Today, I am a confident woman who demands what she is worth and doesn’t settle or accept anything less. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">My wakeup call was enough for me to get myself together and truly understand my purpose. (I remain a giver; but the difference is, I LOVE myself enough <strong>to understand my own worth,</strong> what makes me happy and how <strong>MY JOY</strong> adds value to the successes in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong>I had to choose my happiness and today, I encourage you to do the same. </strong></strong>Know your worth, and don’t allow parasites to distract you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LOVE yourself enough to win!</p>
<p dir="ltr">LOVE YOU!</p>

My Self-Love Journey: If I were honest…
By <a href="http://www.bdavis-designs.com">Brandi Davis</a>

If I were honest...I used to live life as a scared 12-year-old girl until I learned to love myself...

<strong>You see by the age of 12, I had dealt with various things that shaped how I viewed myself.</strong>
<h1>Sexual Abuse</h1>
By 12, my body was more developed than most girls my age. I was teased about my breasts, so I gave them a nickname. You can’t tease after I took over the narrative. I was also heavier than my friends. It was probably only by 5 or 10 lbs, but I noticed it and I wanted, so badly, to be thin like them.

My best friend at the time was always complimented on her “good hair.” I remember asking her, “How do you get your hair so curly?”

Her response, “my mom uses grease and water.”

That next morning, I tried it and FAILED. My hair was still <i>my</i> grade of hair, or “bad.” <strong>No self-love.</strong>

Unlike my curly-haired friend, I had short, super thick hair. My mom had to hot comb most mornings just to braid or pull into a ponytail. I complained, so my sister gave me a “sew-in.” I remember, my teacher rubbing her hand over my head as if to say, “There’s no way you grew this much hair over the summer.”

<strong>I felt so exposed. No self-love.</strong>

By age 12, everyone had their crush. I was never my crush’s type. Yeah, I know we were 12, but he didn’t like me. No one likes the girl that’s a tomboy. I compared myself to others and I thought something had to be wrong with me.

<strong>No self-love.</strong>

<strong>By 12, I had been sexually abused, by an older cousin and I felt as if it was my fault.</strong> <b><i>I must have done something for him to touch me.</i> </b>Then I felt ashamed and I was too scared to tell my parents.

My family didn’t find out about the abuse until I was 31; <b><i>it took me almost 20 years to speak up</i></b>. You see, I got tired of seeing this person and pretending that I was okay. I was angry. I finally spoke up for myself but I still felt bad.

<b>By 12, I was emotionally frozen.</b> I was the smart mouth kid that would cuss you and your mother out. I was angry because of how I felt about myself. Others thought I just had an attitude OR she’s a Capricorn, pay her no attention.

Little did they know, I didn’t pay attention to myself; I was invisible. I had no regard for others or myself. No self-love.

By high school, I had more popular friends and I always the funny/cool one. I only knew how to be smart.

I wasn’t the sexy-dresser. I remember one day, freshman year, I tried to be “sexy,” and it was major failure. It felt like everyone noticed. I felt exposed, yet again. No self-love.

<b>Around this same time, I started drinking because it was easy to get. </b>That habit landed me in the ER with alcohol poisoning. I felt like an embarrassment to my family. I felt shame for <i>them</i>. No self-love.
<h1>Emotional Abuse</h1>
Fast forward to college. I started dating an older guy. He was cool, funny and, um, older. He had a good job and his own car. I was sold. Well, he was also a playboy. <strong>I tried to front like I wasn’t the one for that BS. HA! Time served: 8 years and 3 kids; 2 during our relationship and NONE of them mine. No self-love.</strong>

We went to counseling. Even enjoyed learning the tango while working out our, well MY issues. BUT, CHILE, I had to wake up.

And I left.
<h1>Workplace Abuse</h1>
After I graduated from college, I started working for a major Black-owned publishing company, in Chicago. Yeah, <i>that one</i>.

I was soooo excited, but couldn’t figure out why they picked me. Everyday was like a weekend at grandma’s with your favorite cousins. My time there was exciting but damaging.

<strong>As an artist, I was challenged. Not in a creative way, but as if did I not really know what I was doing.</strong> <b>I was never good enough because someone always had a friend that they wanted in my position.</b> Every project came with a fight to prove that I knew what I was doing.

After years of that, they won. I began to doubt that I did know what I was doing and I gave up. Give them what they want. I was miserable, but didn’t think I could make it anywhere else.

<b>Fear had me. Fear controlled my entire life.</b> I couldn’t leave this great job. It’s a great company. I was underpaid, <i>but at least I had a job</i>. I was disrespected, <i>but at least I had a job</i>. I wasn’t happy, <i>but at least I had a job.</i> I took two steps back. <strong>No self-love.</strong>

<strong>Monday, February 28, 2011, I had a life-changing accident at work.</strong> I received electric shock while plugging up my computer. My coworker drove me to the hospital. They monitored me, and released me that evening.

While at home in pain, I still tried to work, because I felt obligated to the company. By Friday, I was over the obligation.

<b>The pain was very present.</b>

That Sunday was the first time in over a decade that I attended church. I never felt I needed church for a relationship with God. Well, that day, I NEEDED them both.

January 29, 2011, I was on my way to the worker’s comp doctor when I was involved in a car accident on the Dan Ryan. I was the last car hit in a 5-car/semi-truck collision. I suffered a concussion. Another low moment.

<b>For 18 months, I was healing from emotional and physical damage from car accident, electric shock, and worker’s comp.</b> I experienced more pain than ever, and I had hit so many lows. <b>I had to defend my pain; I had to defend my sanity. I didn’t think I would ever design again…it hurt too much. </b>(Editor's note: <em><a href="http://www.bdavis-designs.com">Brandi Davis</a> is a talented graphic artist. Scroll through her portfolio in the photo gallery below.)</em>
<h1>Fighting Back</h1>
I joined a women’s group, at my counselor’s suggestion. They were (and still are) very supportive. My family, friends and random encounters provided comfort. Yet, I wanted to give up.
<blockquote>Until a small voice said, "Go to prayer service."</blockquote>
I got a friend to join me. That night, <strong>I knew that God loved me</strong><i><strong>.</strong> (I’m cried as I wrote the words you’re reading now).</i>

As a woman was praying, she walked up to me and said that a diagnosis for my constant pain would come forth. I didn’t share this with my friend, but that is exactly what I wanted to hear.

Three weeks later, I was diagnosed with RSD, <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_syndrome/article.htm">Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy</a> and a treatment plan was set. I had to take painful numbing injections in my neck and back for three weeks. What did I have to lose?

<b>I was already down to my last hope.</b> I was kicked off worker’s comp because they said I was making up my illness. I was fired from the job. My accounts were all at ZERO. I couldn’t afford my last car payment. <i>MY LAST CAR PAYMENT!</i> Thank God for my father.

So, REALLY, what did I have to lose? I wanted another chance. I wanted to design again. Self-love was slowly creeping in.

<strong>The treatment worked and I felt much better. I was also cleared to get back to work.</strong>

One night, I applied to a job on my phone. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was for CareerBuilder as a web designer for one of their products. They gave me a 2<sup>nd</sup> chance and I will forever be grateful to them. God gave me what I needed in that moment. My first day, I knew I wanted to stay.

It was to be a 3-month contract. My contract was extended over a total of 2+ years. This was the first job that made me feel welcomed and respected. They would always say, “What do you think? You’re the expert. We trust your decision.” That felt good. They supported me. Self-love was slowly creeping in.

Career was great, but the insecure 12-year-old was still hanging around. And she had to go.  I was exhausted from carrying her around. <b>I wanted better, so I got myself a life coach. </b>

<strong>Monique Spence</strong> posts often on Facebook about positive thinking; w<strong>ell, all I knew was negative thoughts, but I was intrigued.</strong> I joined her group calls and did a couple of one-on-one sessions.

I was putting in work, along with my women’s group.

January of 2015 was the first time that I felt self-love. I was at Burning Bowl.
<h1>Reclaiming My Life</h1>
At the age of 33, I finally knew what I wanted; who I was…I loved myself. I moved out of my parent’s home into my dream condo. YES, I was that fearful. I couldn’t leave my comfort zone.

I was beginning to manifest my desires. In all of my life, the age of 33 felt damn good. I turned 34 in December; this year was going to be great! Then, my work situation changed.

January 14, 2016, I was informed that my contract was ending 5 months early. January 29 would be my last day.

Was I shocked? No. I knew my time had come to an end in November, but I stayed because it was familiar. (Doesn’t this sound familiar?)

Was I sad? Yes. I was part of an awesome family. We lunched. We laughed. We’ve even cried together; they supported me when my godson, Deionte, was murdered in September, and I was definitely sad.

On the flip side, I was super EXCITED!

For months, God placed on me that I should focus more on <b>BDavis Designs LLC.</b> Every time the thought entered, I allowed fear to push it away. During the Christmas holiday, I said to myself, “Brandi, it’s time to get focused.”

However, I continued to drag my feet.

Well, God has a way of pushing my hand. And that’s exactly what he did, that Thursday morning.

My manager encouraged me to pursue what I love (and to do standup; my compromise is to blog more lol).

<b>I mourned the loss, and then I got it together.</b>

Fear had no place in my life. At church service, one of the pastors stated:<b> “I cannot call myself a follower of Christ and live in a constant state of fear.” </b>SAY THAT!

In that same service, “my neighbor” told me that God gave her a message for me. Her exact words, “This is your window of opportunity. You are to focus on your business or company. Does any of that make sense for you?”

My response through tears, “YES, it’s confirmation. Thank you!”

I began my faith walk toward working for myself. I want to be my own boss. I want to design. I want to succeed. I want <i>greater</i>. I expect <i>greater</i> and it is so. <b>Self-love.</b>

<b>That has been my inner chant. Monday, February 8, 2016, I become my own BAWSE! Self-love.</b>

Will there be rocky times? Yes. Will I allow fear to stop me? NO! God has my back and has never failed me. I am, FINALLY, following my purpose that God has for me: Designing and spreading my faith. Self-love.

That 12-year-old girl is NOW a grown, confident, funny, creative and loving entrepreneur that loves a good basketball game and dance battles. Self-love.

I love my hair and MANY hairstyles. I love being active and getting in my FitBit steps. I also, love a good dessert. I love a nice graphic body con dress or Ankara print skirt or a great pair of sneakers. I love every part of me that makes me unique. <b>Self-love</b>.

I am ready for this moment in life! I am ready to love and be loved! I am ready to succeed! I am ready for <i>greater</i>. I AM READY! <b>Self-love.</b>

Self-Love is refreshing. I can’t believe it took me this long, but I wouldn’t change the journey.

<b>Self-love.</b>

I’m grateful for those that helped me along this journey, even those that had to fall off. God truly blessed me with a village. From family, friends, women’s group, life coach (and community), co-workers, Facebook, and random angels that seem to find me everywhere.

<b>I am blessed beyond measure; I just had to start loving me. </b>

I mean, who can love you better than God and yourself?! * in my Keith Sweat voice * NOBODY!

<b>SELF-LOVE. Get you some. It feels good.</b>

Thank you, God! More, Please!

PS. If I were honest…I have forgiven myself, my cousin, my ex and anyone else that I placed blame for my lack of love. <b>I’m free!</b>

<h1>Sexual Abuse</h1>
By 12, my body was more developed than most girls my age. I was teased about my breasts, so I gave them a nickname. You can’t tease after I took over the narrative. I was also heavier than my friends. It was probably only by 5 or 10 lbs, but I noticed it and I wanted, so badly, to be thin like them.

My best friend at the time was always complimented on her “good hair.” I remember asking her, “How do you get your hair so curly?”

Her response, “my mom uses grease and water.”

That next morning, I tried it and FAILED. My hair was still <i>my</i> grade of hair, or “bad.” <strong>No self-love.</strong>

Unlike my curly-haired friend, I had short, super thick hair. My mom had to hot comb most mornings just to braid or pull into a ponytail. I complained, so my sister gave me a “sew-in.” I remember, my teacher rubbing her hand over my head as if to say, “There’s no way you grew this much hair over the summer.”

<strong>I felt so exposed. No self-love.</strong>

By age 12, everyone had their crush. I was never my crush’s type. Yeah, I know we were 12, but he didn’t like me. No one likes the girl that’s a tomboy. I compared myself to others and I thought something had to be wrong with me.

<strong>No self-love.</strong>

<strong>By 12, I had been sexually abused, by an older cousin and I felt as if it was my fault.</strong> <b><i>I must have done something for him to touch me.</i> </b>Then I felt ashamed and I was too scared to tell my parents.

My family didn’t find out about the abuse until I was 31; <b><i>it took me almost 20 years to speak up</i></b>. You see, I got tired of seeing this person and pretending that I was okay. I was angry. I finally spoke up for myself but I still felt bad.

<b>By 12, I was emotionally frozen.</b> I was the smart mouth kid that would cuss you and your mother out. I was angry because of how I felt about myself. Others thought I just had an attitude OR she’s a Capricorn, pay her no attention.

Little did they know, I didn’t pay attention to myself; I was invisible. I had no regard for others or myself. No self-love.

By high school, I had more popular friends and I always the funny/cool one. I only knew how to be smart.

I wasn’t the sexy-dresser. I remember one day, freshman year, I tried to be “sexy,” and it was major failure. It felt like everyone noticed. I felt exposed, yet again. No self-love.

<b>Around this same time, I started drinking because it was easy to get. </b>That habit landed me in the ER with alcohol poisoning. I felt like an embarrassment to my family. I felt shame for <i>them</i>. No self-love.
<h1>Emotional Abuse</h1>
Fast forward to college. I started dating an older guy. He was cool, funny and, um, older. He had a good job and his own car. I was sold. Well, he was also a playboy. <strong>I tried to front like I wasn’t the one for that BS. HA! Time served: 8 years and 3 kids; 2 during our relationship and NONE of them mine. No self-love.</strong>

We went to counseling. Even enjoyed learning the tango while working out our, well MY issues. BUT, CHILE, I had to wake up.

And I left.
<h1>Workplace Abuse</h1>
After I graduated from college, I started working for a major Black-owned publishing company, in Chicago. Yeah, <i>that one</i>.

I was soooo excited, but couldn’t figure out why they picked me. Everyday was like a weekend at grandma’s with your favorite cousins. My time there was exciting but damaging.

<strong>As an artist, I was challenged. Not in a creative way, but as if did I not really know what I was doing.</strong> <b>I was never good enough because someone always had a friend that they wanted in my position.</b> Every project came with a fight to prove that I knew what I was doing.

After years of that, they won. I began to doubt that I did know what I was doing and I gave up. Give them what they want. I was miserable, but didn’t think I could make it anywhere else.

<b>Fear had me. Fear controlled my entire life.</b> I couldn’t leave this great job. It’s a great company. I was underpaid, <i>but at least I had a job</i>. I was disrespected, <i>but at least I had a job</i>. I wasn’t happy, <i>but at least I had a job.</i> I took two steps back. <strong>No self-love.</strong>

<strong>Monday, February 28, 2011, I had a life-changing accident at work.</strong> I received electric shock while plugging up my computer. My coworker drove me to the hospital. They monitored me, and released me that evening.

While at home in pain, I still tried to work, because I felt obligated to the company. By Friday, I was over the obligation.

<b>The pain was very present.</b>

That Sunday was the first time in over a decade that I attended church. I never felt I needed church for a relationship with God. Well, that day, I NEEDED them both.

January 29, 2011, I was on my way to the worker’s comp doctor when I was involved in a car accident on the Dan Ryan. I was the last car hit in a 5-car/semi-truck collision. I suffered a concussion. Another low moment.

<b>For 18 months, I was healing from emotional and physical damage from car accident, electric shock, and worker’s comp.</b> I experienced more pain than ever, and I had hit so many lows. <b>I had to defend my pain; I had to defend my sanity. I didn’t think I would ever design again…it hurt too much. </b>(Editor's note: <em><a href="http://www.bdavis-designs.com">Brandi Davis</a> is a talented graphic artist. Scroll through her portfolio in the photo gallery below.)</em>
<h1>Fighting Back</h1>
I joined a women’s group, at my counselor’s suggestion. They were (and still are) very supportive. My family, friends and random encounters provided comfort. Yet, I wanted to give up.
<blockquote>Until a small voice said, "Go to prayer service."</blockquote>
I got a friend to join me. That night, <strong>I knew that God loved me</strong><i><strong>.</strong> (I’m cried as I wrote the words you’re reading now).</i>

As a woman was praying, she walked up to me and said that a diagnosis for my constant pain would come forth. I didn’t share this with my friend, but that is exactly what I wanted to hear.

Three weeks later, I was diagnosed with RSD, <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy_syndrome/article.htm">Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy</a> and a treatment plan was set. I had to take painful numbing injections in my neck and back for three weeks. What did I have to lose?

<b>I was already down to my last hope.</b> I was kicked off worker’s comp because they said I was making up my illness. I was fired from the job. My accounts were all at ZERO. I couldn’t afford my last car payment. <i>MY LAST CAR PAYMENT!</i> Thank God for my father.

So, REALLY, what did I have to lose? I wanted another chance. I wanted to design again. Self-love was slowly creeping in.

<strong>The treatment worked and I felt much better. I was also cleared to get back to work.</strong>

One night, I applied to a job on my phone. I didn’t know it at the time, but it was for CareerBuilder as a web designer for one of their products. They gave me a 2<sup>nd</sup> chance and I will forever be grateful to them. God gave me what I needed in that moment. My first day, I knew I wanted to stay.

It was to be a 3-month contract. My contract was extended over a total of 2+ years. This was the first job that made me feel welcomed and respected. They would always say, “What do you think? You’re the expert. We trust your decision.” That felt good. They supported me. Self-love was slowly creeping in.

Career was great, but the insecure 12-year-old was still hanging around. And she had to go.  I was exhausted from carrying her around. <b>I wanted better, so I got myself a life coach. </b>

<strong>Monique Spence</strong> posts often on Facebook about positive thinking; w<strong>ell, all I knew was negative thoughts, but I was intrigued.</strong> I joined her group calls and did a couple of one-on-one sessions.

I was putting in work, along with my women’s group.

January of 2015 was the first time that I felt self-love. I was at Burning Bowl.
<h1>Reclaiming My Life</h1>
At the age of 33, I finally knew what I wanted; who I was…I loved myself. I moved out of my parent’s home into my dream condo. YES, I was that fearful. I couldn’t leave my comfort zone.

I was beginning to manifest my desires. In all of my life, the age of 33 felt damn good. I turned 34 in December; this year was going to be great! Then, my work situation changed.

January 14, 2016, I was informed that my contract was ending 5 months early. January 29 would be my last day.

Was I shocked? No. I knew my time had come to an end in November, but I stayed because it was familiar. (Doesn’t this sound familiar?)

Was I sad? Yes. I was part of an awesome family. We lunched. We laughed. We’ve even cried together; they supported me when my godson, Deionte, was murdered in September, and I was definitely sad.

On the flip side, I was super EXCITED!

For months, God placed on me that I should focus more on <b>BDavis Designs LLC.</b> Every time the thought entered, I allowed fear to push it away. During the Christmas holiday, I said to myself, “Brandi, it’s time to get focused.”

However, I continued to drag my feet.

Well, God has a way of pushing my hand. And that’s exactly what he did, that Thursday morning.

My manager encouraged me to pursue what I love (and to do standup; my compromise is to blog more lol).

<b>I mourned the loss, and then I got it together.</b>

Fear had no place in my life. At church service, one of the pastors stated:<b> “I cannot call myself a follower of Christ and live in a constant state of fear.” </b>SAY THAT!

In that same service, “my neighbor” told me that God gave her a message for me. Her exact words, “This is your window of opportunity. You are to focus on your business or company. Does any of that make sense for you?”

My response through tears, “YES, it’s confirmation. Thank you!”

I began my faith walk toward working for myself. I want to be my own boss. I want to design. I want to succeed. I want <i>greater</i>. I expect <i>greater</i> and it is so. <b>Self-love.</b>

<b>That has been my inner chant. Monday, February 8, 2016, I become my own BAWSE! Self-love.</b>

Will there be rocky times? Yes. Will I allow fear to stop me? NO! God has my back and has never failed me. I am, FINALLY, following my purpose that God has for me: Designing and spreading my faith. Self-love.

That 12-year-old girl is NOW a grown, confident, funny, creative and loving entrepreneur that loves a good basketball game and dance battles. Self-love.

I love my hair and MANY hairstyles. I love being active and getting in my FitBit steps. I also, love a good dessert. I love a nice graphic body con dress or Ankara print skirt or a great pair of sneakers. I love every part of me that makes me unique. <b>Self-love</b>.

I am ready for this moment in life! I am ready to love and be loved! I am ready to succeed! I am ready for <i>greater</i>. I AM READY! <b>Self-love.</b>

Self-Love is refreshing. I can’t believe it took me this long, but I wouldn’t change the journey.

<b>Self-love.</b>

I’m grateful for those that helped me along this journey, even those that had to fall off. God truly blessed me with a village. From family, friends, women’s group, life coach (and community), co-workers, Facebook, and random angels that seem to find me everywhere.

<b>I am blessed beyond measure; I just had to start loving me. </b>

I mean, who can love you better than God and yourself?! * in my Keith Sweat voice * NOBODY!

<b>SELF-LOVE. Get you some. It feels good.</b>

Thank you, God! More, Please!

PS. If I were honest…I have forgiven myself, my cousin, my ex and anyone else that I placed blame for my lack of love. <b>I’m free!</b>

As a teen mom in the early 90’s, <strong>I was judged and presumed to be a lost cause all because I had a child. </strong>The adults around me believed my future was bleak; I must say my image of self-worth was quite distorted and tainted by their views.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>Still, I had dreams and aspirations to do great things in life. </strong>
<h1>THE DREAM</h1>
As a high school senior, I found myself answering model calls and being solicited from major companies to begin a career as a print model.

However, just as my mother did not support my thoughts of attending college she was also unwilling to support my pursuit of a modeling career. <b>It was her belief that I did not “have what it takes” to become a model. </b>With low self-esteem it seemed like I was headed for a dead-end job just as my high school counselor had sternly stated to me; she suggested that I seek a factory job to support my baby, rather than to attend college or pursue my dreams of being in entertainment.

<strong>These dreams would later materialize after I had moved out on my own and found great success as a professional hairstylist.</strong>

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/andreanicole1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12540" alt="andreanicole1" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/andreanicole1-240x300.jpg" width="240" height="300" /></a>Although my life was stable I still felt unfulfilled and often struggled with depression when one day a good friend of mine asked me to assist him in building his photography portfolio as his model. I agreed:

Suddenly things seemed to be happening practically overnight from this point. My dear friend posted my picture on his website where I would be noticed by “SHOW MAGAZINE” representative. I was asked participate in an upcoming modeling competition and I won.

<strong>Although I decided not to participate in a photo shoot with this company at that time, I did meet the man that would later become my manager.</strong>

I trusted him and he urged me to pursue a modeling and acting career. I thought I had finally had the support I had so deeply desired my whole life.
<h1>THE STRUGGLE</h1>
I was experiencing success as both an actress and a model. I was happy with the direction my career appeared to be headed when I got the phone call from my manager informing me that I was requested to attend an upcoming casting call for the <b>TV Series “<a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/flavor-of-love">FLAVOR OF LOVE</a>.”</b>

At first I was excited and blinded by the incentives that I had been promised based solely upon how many episodes that I would appear. I was ordered to go home and study the first season and learn how I could stay on the show. I did. I watched the season with my daughter who was only13-years-old at the time.

<b>After watching the entire first season with me I turned to her and asked if she would be embarrassed if I participated in the taping; she answered, “YES.”</b>  I decided at that moment that I would not participate in the taping of the show. I was shocked to see how infuriated my manager had become with my decision. I then realized that my team did not have my best interest at hand. I realized that I was nothing more than another young face and a paycheck.
<h1> The COME UP</h1>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJz1zfI1zPk" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<b>At that point I decided to create my own path of success</b>. I decided to pursue my talents as a writer and director rather than to sit back and wait for Hollywood to come to me with the same type-cast, no substance characters. And I put skin in the game; I earned a B.A. from Columbia College to learn the trade while at the time I owned a hair salon and was a single mom raising two girls.

I went on to write, direct and produce as an independent artist.

My work as Writer/Director of Walt Whitman’s “<b><i>Soul Stories</i></b>” premiered the following year in Los Angeles.

I am currently proud and thankful that I did not allow my past hurt and struggle to keep me from pursuing my dreams and goals. I am happy to say I am currently writing and producing several more of my own independent projects including the upcoming short film “MANIC” which will premiere early 2016 along with another “POETIC JUSTICE” to premiere during the latter part of the year.

The point is, nearly everyone who was supposed to support me, told me that my dream would not become reality because I had a child at a young age.

I didn't listen to them, and neither should you. Never allow naysayers to block your vision, no matter your circumstances. Dream big, and do the work to get it.

From the very beginning…everybody always wanted something from me. Either it was my mind, my body, what I do, the rewards of what I do, etc.

I never felt loved.

Ever.
<h1><b>The Rage</b></h1>
A sharp pain erupted through my temples where a bandage bled red onto an unfamiliar place of rest. I was in jail, vaguely recalling the cause.

The evening prior was supposed to be a night of celebration; I received a new position in a field that I had no technical training in, yet somehow I managed to flourish.

God blessed me with intellect.

At the time, I moved from Chicago to Lake County and I was truly excited about the new life I had an opportunity to build. The city was controlling me and I was ready for an out. Besides, I wanted to give my then 3-year-old <i>sun</i>, a chance to live.

On the evening in question, I was having a few drinks with my cousin and a friend of hers. That night I was harassed by an officer in the military; he spit in my face and shouted racial slurs. I had a choice to make: call the police or get violent. I chose the latter.

If you know me, it didn’t end well for him…or me for that matter. <b>You can move me out of the hood but physically moving is not going to remove the hood from me.</b> One would say the fact that I was a certified thug and a business professional balanced each other out. I beg to differ. I mean, I learned a lot in the streets but I was a hot head.

My decision to get violent resulted in my facing 15 years for Double Aggravated Battery with intent to commit bodily harm with a firearm; which subsequently, after an expensive trial, was dropped down to a single battery. This was ONLY due to the fact I was in college with a 3.9 GPA, no prior convictions and cried all during court. Self-defense.

<b>God gave me another chance during those proceedings</b> that I would soon take advantage of over and over again. Right after I was released; I was right back to drinking--like it never happened.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/kenyattarage.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12522" alt="kenyattarage" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/kenyattarage.jpg" width="350" height="724" /></a>Drinking and smoking weed had become tools of a familiar comfort as my life transitioned in many different directions. After the court case, it was still hard for me to find a good/permanent job due to the background checks.

The next few years were rough. Still fighting off the inner G that kept popping up and sticking its finger in this mosh posh of a life I had. I was all over the place. I couldn’t find my foothold in this novel town after this court case. I eventually packed up and moved further north to Wisconsin. <b>I became so withdrawn and lonely during this time that I went back to what was a familiar comfort.</b> By this time, I had acquired a taste and ‘feeling’ from alcohol that I began to desire regularly.  <b>I was drinking from sun up to sundown; surprisingly enough, I was able to go for YEARS undetected.</b>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>The Hell </b></h1>
Over the next few years I would live an uncontrolled kind of life if you will. The one thing that kept me from falling totally off the cliff was the fact that responsibility was placed heavily in my heart and no matter how messed up things were, I was always taking care of business.

I found success in some jobs but none were long lasting; two years or less. <b>I felt like my name was ‘Can’t Get Right’ </b>because God would put me in some of the best positions that I couldn’t seem to retain due to causes that ALWAYS felt like they weren’t created by my own devices.

It began to seem like no matter how much I tried, the ‘hood’ in me was in charge; almost like a defense mechanism.  I was a very no nonsense type of person who rarely dealt with emotions unless they were, what I felt as, warranted emotions/reactions. I was scorn. I hid things deep inside.

<b>I never felt feminine by no means, really.</b> Lost my TRUE virginity to an older woman and eventually dated women 15 years straight; taking on the role of the aggressor. It’s all I knew. It just felt right. I later found out that no matter how ‘right’ it felt, none of it was. I was out of control doing what I wanted and when I wanted. Funny thing about me is, my responsibilities never fell to the wayside. Another blessing. At this point in my life… NOTHING but GOD was keeping me alive!

I eventually found a job through a temp services that hired me permanently based on my academics in college, my willingness to learn and the fact that I worked hard and was dedicated. Why not; their internal HR attorneys overlooked my court case and gave me the opportunity to prove myself. I proved myself alright. I proved that I was still the SAME misguided soul I had always been regardless of what God was showing me and doing in my life. I was a victim of pattern living. So came “going through the motions.” I was playing both sides in my mind only to survive.  Why was this happening to me?

Going through the motions for me meant I tried to behave as if everything was okay. I had a job with benefits and bonuses, a wife, my sun was the child most parents were in awe of, and we had two incomes which allowed for travel and many recreational activities.

<b>In the eyes of others; life was perfect. I still wasn’t right, though. I was worse</b>.

She, and others, began using me and taking advantage of my kindness because it became clearly apparent to them that I was seriously trying to be a good girl. I eventually became a bitter asshole because no matter how much success I had or positive changes I made, I was still viewed as the thug/worthless/dead inside. I wanted them all to love me but for the life of me, I couldn’t get from underneath that stigma so I was like, why not be a disregarding ass. <b>I changed my name to Ke-Sera and lived as such; whatever will be will be. </b>To top it off, jealousy of my individual accomplishments throughout life, created wedges in relationships. It was all driving me crazy. <b>So you know what I did, I drank and drank some more which eventually spilled all over my world.</b>

Driving with one eye open, I stomped hard on the breaks to avoid a pedestrian. The sound of my heartbeat sang melodic hymns of fear as it began to harmonize with the clinking sounds underneath my seats.  <b>You would think that after falling asleep at the stop light in Skokie, of all places, and attaining a DUI months prior, that I would stop. I didn’t.</b> There were beer cans everywhere; in the armrest, under the seat, in the trunk, all over my night stand at home, each of the garbage cans were full…of beer cans and alcohol bottles.

<b>I was falling apart at the seams.</b> I cried out for help but was given the football arm of tolerance and was told, “You are strong, and you will get over it.” I heard that so much in my life that I coached myself into thinking I could. No one ever knew I was broken down in the inside; I needed love.

I had most recently lost my job of almost ten years. I was fired because I was wrongfully accused of “cheating on my time card.” Like for real; they said I cheated on my time card.

I was making about $71,000 annually, with bonuses, yet accused of stealing $400 worth of time. See why I said, “FOREAL!?!” I was working for one of longest standing Pharmaceutical companies in the world and had worked my way up from File Clerk - Contract Management to Executive Assistant to a divisional Vice President. It felt as if this was the place I would retire; it was all over.

That was not true.

Transition of the company due to changes in the health care laws created a plateau of fear as the company was laying off as well as going through a major restructure to comply with costs and new provisions. My current VP was demoted and I received a new one. He didn’t like me from the start. It was all downhill from there. It became hellish to work there and they knew I didn’t like it. <b>I was taken advantage of real bad after that and then fired under, State noted, false pretenses.</b> I, to this day, think this is karma for me taking advantage of my role by drinking before work and never getting caught; and all the other stupid things I did knowing I wouldn’t get CAUGHT.

<b>I began to feel as if I was cursed. </b>

I lost everything down to my socks. <b>I was homeless, </b>wife and I were no more and I had to unnervingly move my sun to Chicago to finish school. I couldn’t take care of him anymore. <b>They fought my unemployment tooth and nail for months.</b> I had no income. I would go on to experience the worst three years of my life. <b>I turned into a monster.</b> I was so angry at life, so withdrawn from everything. I was alone, AGAIN, and deeply misunderstood.

I just wanted someone to love and understand me.

Notice I never said, “I turned to God.” I just kept trying to repair everything on my own. It was almost like I can hear the words “you still haven’t learned yet, I see.”

<b>It was during my time in the performance realm that I began to perceive and comprehend it all.</b> Every setback was God trying to get my attention to show me where I should be in life and what I was to do with all of the experiences I encountered over the years.

<b>The end result: God wanted all of me and not just what I was willing to give.</b> I had stories to tell that needed to be heard and I had no choice but to comply. Life was finally beginning to make sense.

At first, the stage was a place for me to digress and leave it all, but it ultimately became my plinth of peace and survival. I talked about everything that transpired in my life, in my pieces.

I started to notice that folks were really taking to the realism of my writing, the emotion in my interjections and the power of my projections.  I began to be considered for more and more venues that was okay at first but began to drain me.

<b>It wasn’t until mid-performance at a church women’s retreat that I felt the spirit take over me.</b> I cried so hard after that performance. I realized my calling and why my spirit felt led to go back to the stage. I used to be an accomplished performer in Chicago but walked away from it all to find a new life. I had stopped performing years prior. It was time for me to take my appropriate seat. I’m glad I finally adhered to God’s voice that spoke to me thru supporters who would express to me after a performance that my poems spoke directly to them and how my work has brought increase to their sprit. Go figure.

My troubled life and accounts of survival were exactly what was needed to bring them into a mental and emotional state of freedom. Me too. I was trapped there for a very long time and needed to be genuinely loved past these self-created traps.

But, again, I was so rigid on myself that I couldn’t even FORGIVE myself. I eventually found the answers in self, through thine third eye.

<b>God sent me leaders and spiritual assessors, dads, wives, and pastors that I utilized in my journey to peace. </b>

<b>I was sent folks who truly loved on me and let me know it’s okay to not have all the answers.</b> Some let me know it was okay to cry and to be weak if it leads you back to peace. Some were even strong FOR me when I was tired of being strong for myself.

<b>I began to decipher the voice of God talking to me. I began to love…ME! </b>

Over time, with a conscious mind, I started doing research. I reached and prayed. Prayed some more and I forgave myself. I eventually began to forgive others<b>. I went to therapy and literally left it on her couch and in God’s hands.</b> I became more conscious of how I presented myself in the community because as an artist who desires achievement, you have to maintain appropriate positive imagery. Also, as a promising woman of God, I had to be wary of what I do before the eyes of the people and most importantly, the Most High.

<b>I became a mentor and that pushed me to want to be a better illustration of empowerment and strength to those I chance upon.</b>  I dropped the name Ke-Sera and went back to my Earth day name; <b>Kenyatta, as I was ready to be accountable for my actions which was the opposite of Ke-Sera.</b> <b>I was sent a man to show me how it feels to be preserved as Queen and accept nothing less. The desire to drink was slowly beginning to fade.</b>

Today, I no longer abuse alcohol. I am still a work in progress. I’m working towards not drinking at all but I haven’t arrived at that plateau yet. Almost.

I can tell you that cans and bottles no longer clink J I no longer yearn to be accepted and I am very comfortable in my skin so the desires to ‘drift off’ are fading.

I have found a balance in my sexuality as I continue to walk in deliverance of the many, MANY demons I once hoarded in my universe as comfort. My pen is now moved to heal and remove; uplift and breathe life.

I am working permanently in the small town that saved me with its nothingness.

I have no choice but to hone in on God’s promise. It was all I had.

<b>I am so removed that I can’t really grasp anything outside of my spiritual alignment</b>. I can honestly say I am truly happy for the first time in my life. Gave it all up, including poetry (for a little while, that is) only get it back triple fold (I am now doing High School tours through my job). My God is a good God. Forgave me to save me so I can teach and heal those still trying to find someone who genuinely cares.

I am still a walking work in progress. Won’t you come take a walk with me?

Today, I no longer abuse alcohol. I am still a work in progress. I’m working towards not drinking at all but I haven’t arrived at that plateau yet. Almost.

I can tell you that cans and bottles no longer clink J I no longer yearn to be accepted and I am very comfortable in my skin so the desires to ‘drift off’ are fading.

I have found a balance in my sexuality as I continue to walk in deliverance of the many, MANY demons I once hoarded in my universe as comfort. My pen is now moved to heal and remove; uplift and breathe life.

I am working permanently in the small town that saved me with its nothingness.

I have no choice but to hone in on God’s promise. It was all I had.

<b>I am so removed that I can’t really grasp anything outside of my spiritual alignment</b>. I can honestly say I am truly happy for the first time in my life. Gave it all up, including poetry (for a little while, that is) only get it back triple fold (I am now doing High School tours through my job). My God is a good God. Forgave me to save me so I can teach and heal those still trying to find someone who genuinely cares.

I am still a walking work in progress. Won’t you come take a walk with me?

<b>1.   </b><b>Believe in yourself: </b>When on a journey to becoming the healthiest version of you, believing that you can achieve your goals is the first step. YOU matter. It’s important
that YOU consistently eat right and exercise. But YOU have to change your mind about food and working out. I don’t care who told you that you can’t do it or that you’ll give up. They are irrelevant and their opinion does not count. You can do any and everything that you set your mind to. If your doctor says that it may be wise to lose a good 30lbs, lose 35!! Because eating clean isn’t a punishment and working out isn’t a chore. You’ve gotta wake up every day and tell yourself “I’m a boss, and I can do this.” Change your mind, change your body.

<b>2.     </b><b>Ditch the steady state cardio and get to HIIT! HIIT cardio </b>will lead to increased aerobic capacity and a higher fat burn! You will be burning calories hours after you’re done with the workout! Try my favorite 2:1 work-­‐to-­‐rest  ratio, like  squat
jumps for one minute followed by 30 seconds of rest time or one minute run with a 30 second walk; you get it! You don’t have to be bored on the treadmill for long periods of time anymore. Keep it short and sweaty.
<b>3.     </b><b>Get rid of your scale. </b>Weighing yourself everyday can easily become an unhealthy obsession. Just remember, muscle weighs more than fat. If you are doing what you
need to do to tone up your body then the scale will go up and down. Adequate cardio, strength training and proper nutrition will get you where you need to be. Instead of scale hopping, take pictures and pay attention to how your jeans fit. Do you have more energy? Do you find yourself not cravings sweets at night anymore?
That just means to keep going ;)

Add a couple slices of avocado to your omelet in the morning, thank me later.

By<a href="http://rhondaealexander.com/author-page/"> Rhonda Alexander</a>

I discovered the green smoothie lifestyle as a result of actively working to reduce my carb intake. Initially, I was in search of a healthier way to enjoy fruity drinks, which have always been my weakness. It's the one part of my diet that I've always struggled to overcome.

<strong>As a child, I loved a particular strawberry flavored milk drink, but as an adult, I found that the powder was nothing but sugar. When I checked the label, the nutrition label showed that an 8-ounce serving was 150 calories and 15 g of carbohydrates.</strong>

I would fix 12-16 ounces for my "serving" at the very least!

By the time I reached my mid-thirties, my doctor had begun to talk to me about possibly starting diabetic medication since my A1C (blood sugar level measurement over time-typically the last 3 months) levels were creeping up.

Normal A1C levels are typically 4-5.5%. Mine was staying on the higher end of the scale and getting closer to 6 every time she measured it. In addition, my family history was strong for Type 2 Diabetes and my lifestyle was sedentary, at best.
<h3>In short, I exhibited every risk factor there is for developing Type 2 Diabetes as an adult.</h3>
<b>I had seen how it ravaged my loved ones, taken away their independence and reduced them to a life spent in the doctor's office or hospital and I wanted no part of that legacy. </b>

Because I was determined to stay in charge of my life, I loved my fruity drinks and I'd always dreamt of having a healthy body and possibly even helping others, in some way, I began to research healthy drinks.

I must admit, the first time I tried an all-vegetable drink outside of V8 Juice, I didn't like it very much, but I wasn't deterred.

I continued to educate myself and even incorporated juiced fruits into my recipes. I continued to tweak recipes, research food nutrition and stayed committed to leaving the fruity drinks behind.

<img alt="" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/six-brown-chicks/files/2016/02/Man-Yana-Nirvana1.jpg" />

<b>Six months after I began the "green smoothie" journey, I found that I'd lost 28-lbs and I hadn't fully incorporated exercising into my lifestyle, at that point. </b>The only change I'd made was leaving the fruity drinks behind for the healthier versions of them and I had lost this tremendous amount of weight, I'd begun to sleep more regularly and I had more energy to get through my day.

Seeing the changes for myself inspired me to keep going and begin to compile my recipes (the good ones, anyway) into a collection that has become part of my lifestyle and I haven't looked back since. That is how <a href="http://rhondaealexander.com/author-page/"><i>Green Smoothie Bliss</i></a> was born.

<strong>Change is a good thing, especially if a healthier version of you is the end result.</strong>
