                                        At the age of 13, Kamasi Washington started a lifelong quest discovering the many wonders of music. One night, his father left his soprano saxophone lying on the piano. Kamasi, filled with curiosity for all the beauty he heard from the instrument, picked up his father&rsquo;s horn. Even though he didn&rsquo;t know anything about the saxophone &ndash; in fact, never even touched one &ndash; he played Wayne Shorter&rsquo;s composition &ldquo;Sleeping Dancer Sleep On,&rdquo; his favorite song at the time. 

At the prestigious Hamilton High School Music Academy, within two years, Kamasi earned the lead tenor saxophone chair in the top jazz ensemble. At the same time, Kamasi joined the Multi School Jazz Band (MSJB) where he reunited with several childhood friends who were pursuing their passion for music. During his senior year of high school, Kamasi formed his first band, &ldquo;The Young Jazz Giants,&rdquo; with childhood friends including Ronald Bruner, Stephen Bruner and Cameron Graves. After high school, Kamasi received a full scholarship to study ethnomusicology at UCLA, where he explored many of the non-western musical cultures around the world. During the summer after his freshman year, Kamasi recorded his first album with &ldquo;The Young Jazz Giants&rdquo; to spread new sounds of jazz all around the country. In his second year at UCLA, Kamasi went on his first national tour with the west coast hip-hop legend Snoop Dogg. Later that year, Kamasi joined the orchestra of one of his biggest heroes, Gerald Wilson, and later went on his first international tour with R&amp;B legend Raphael Saadiq.

Over the years, Kamasi has performed and recorded with many of his musical heroes from various genres, including Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, Freddie Hubbard, Kenny Burrell, George Duke, Lauryn Hill, Jeffrey Osborne, Mos Def, Quincy Jones, Stanley Clark, Harvey Mason and Chaka Khan. Kamasi&rsquo;s own band &ldquo;The Next Step&rdquo; is a modern spin on a big band, which includes two drummers, two upright bass players, keyboard players, three horns players, a pianist, and a vocalist. In addition, Kamasi is part of a west coast musical collective called the &ldquo;West Coast Get Down.&rdquo;

Most recently, Kamasi worked on Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s acclaimed 2015 album &ldquo;To Pimp A Butterfly.&rdquo; On May 5th, Kamasi released his groundbreaking solo album &ldquo;The Epic&rdquo; on the trend-setting record label Brainfeeder. &ldquo;The Epic&rdquo; is a 172-minute, triple-disc masterpiece, featuring Kamasi&rsquo;s ten-piece band &ldquo;The Next Step&rdquo; along with a full string orchestra and full choir. &ldquo;The Epic&rdquo; debuted #1 on several iTunes Jazz charts, including the US, Canada, Australia, Russia and UK.

                                        While crafting his debut album, Vince Staples revisited one of the most pivotal periods in his life. The Long Beach, California rapper did so because it is the time that inspired the things he&#39;s discussed throughout his music. For him, it was a line of demarcation for his evolution. 

With Summertime &#39;06, Vince Staples delves into the crucial season of his life, one where he discovered what his life was about and what it was shaping up to be. It was a wild, a coming-of-age time depicted on Hell Can Wait, his acclaimed 2014 Def Jam Recordings EP. &quot;That&#39;s the prequel to what we&#39;re speaking about on this album,&quot; he says, &quot;the point where we kind of had to grow up and fend for ourselves.&quot; 

On Hell Can Wait and his revered mixtapes, Vince Staples rapped with a masterful blend of observation and first-person passion. With Summertime &#39;06, he takes listeners to the very streets in which he was raised in a way that&#39;s rarely been done on an entire album. In fact, this change in presentation is as gripping as it is revolutionary.

&quot;I&#39;ve never heard anything that literally in the moment of when it&#39;s happening,&quot; he says. &quot;I tried to capture that. Even with Biggie, it was, &#39;It was all a dream.&#39; It wasn&#39;t happening at that very moment. I wanted to capture the energy and the emotion of actually being in that environment, something that nobody really knows about because not a lot of people rapping really had to go through that.&quot;

Case in point is lead single &quot;Senorita.&quot; The ultra-dark, piano-accented and thunderous beat serves as a stellar soundbed for one of the California artist&#39;s explorations into what really matters to people. There&#39;s a rebellious energy in the song that&#39;s equaled by his furious rapping, a quality that marks a new stage in Vince Staples&#39; artistry. &quot;If the music doesn&#39;t grow with you, you&#39;re done,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#39;s the next step.&quot;

Throughout Summertime &#39;06, Vince Staples showcases what he&#39;s learned about life and about making music. As the album progresses, we enter the mind of a young teenager whose life consisted of robbing people and getting into fights. He and his friends knew that they were wrong and that they were putting everything on the line for questionable objectives. They also knew that their lives had the distinct possibility of repeating this desperate cycle until the end of their lives. 

It&#39;s a situation tens of thousands of kids find themselves in, at least in part because of the actions of their parents. On the murky &quot;Birds + Beez,&quot; Vince Staples addresses this reality. &quot;I&#39;m speaking about how my parents&#39; actions and ways lead to what happens to me,&quot; he explains. &quot;It&#39;s the same thing with my grandmother prioritizing money over everything growing up. That led to, &#39;OK. So we need to get money from somewhere.&#39; They come from a completely different time period and don&#39;t think about what their words mean to us. It&#39;s an example of what their downfalls could lead to for me and my generation because it&#39;s a generational thing. We&#39;re really the first generation that was a product of it. My grandparents were at the tail end of the Black Panthers turning into these &#39;gangs.&#39; My parents were at the beginning of Crips and Bloods.&quot;

This mindset plays perfectly into the mesmerizing &quot;Get Paid,&quot; a dissertation on how money is a means of control. &quot;If everybody had money, nobody would be dying,&quot; Vince Staples says. &quot;The song is about a first-person perspective of that. When you&#39;re young and you don&#39;t have nothing and you watch TV and you see a rapper or an athlete from your area that has something you&#39;ve never seen before, it builds up an anger. That anger gets translated when you find a way to make a means for yourself. That&#39;s the easiest way to do it.&quot;

With &quot;Street Punks,&quot; Vince Staples examines how people don&#39;t come to grips with life-and-death situations until they are confronted with them themselves, while the mind-blowing &quot;Jump Off The Roof&quot; explores the danger of putting too much stock in something you have no control over. &quot;It&#39;s about faith,&quot; Vince Staples says. &quot;It&#39;s about letting yourself go and relieving yourself of that stress by things that don&#39;t matter at the end of the day because nothing matters at the end of the day &ndash; and that&#39;s the scary part about life. Nothing at all matters. You pick what matters.&quot;

But people often find themselves ill-equipped to deal with life&#39;s harsh realities. Part of that is familial circumstance or the lack of a support system, a reality addressed on the album&#39;s title track. &quot;It&#39;s about figuring things out at a very young because nobody&#39;s going to help you,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#39;s something everybody can relate to. They might not relate to an action itself, but you can relate to the energy and emotion because it&#39;s the energy of confusion, pain, aggression, anger. Everybody deals with that when you&#39;re 13, 14, 15 years old, whether it&#39;s, &#39;Mom, you never let me do anything&#39; or, &#39;Mom, you don&#39;t care about me.&#39; It&#39;s still that frustration stemming from a lack of guidance, lack of better judgment.&quot;

Born and raised in Long Beach, California, Vince Staples has emerged as one of rap&#39;s preeminent rising artists. He&#39;s released two installments of his Shyne Coldchain mixtape series and paired in 2013 with Mac Miller (under the alias Larry Fisherman) for the revered Stolen Youth mixtape. Successful tours and collaborations with Earl Sweatshirt and ScHoolboy Q also dot his resume, as does 2014&#39;s Hell Can Wait EP, his sterling debut Def Jam project. 

Now, with Summertime &#39;06, Vince Staples has crafted a full-length album on rap&#39;s most important label. For Vince Staples, it&#39;s about much more than just being a well-paid, high-profile artist. 

&quot;I don&#39;t care about money because I&#39;ve always been broke,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&#39;t care about attention because I&#39;ve got a gap between my teeth and a speech problem. I don&#39;t care about fame because it&#39;s corny. I don&#39;t care about being a rapper because those dudes embarrass themselves. What I care about is that when you die, were you full of crap. That&#39;s what matters where I come from.&quot;

It&#39;s a lesson Vince Staples learned during the Summertime &#39;06.

                                        DIIV is the nom-de-plume of Z. Cole Smith, musical provocateur and front-man of an atmospheric and autumnally-charged new Brooklyn four-piece.

Recently inked to the uber-reliable Captured Tracks imprint, DIIV created instant vibrations in the blog-world with their impressionistic debut Sometime; finding it&#39;s way onto the esteemed pages of Pitchfork and Altered Zones a mere matter of weeks after the group&#39;s formation.

Enlisting the aid of NYC indie-scene-luminary, Devin Ruben Perez, former Smith Westerns drummer Colby Hewitt, and Mr. Smith&#39;s childhood friend Andrew Bailey, DIIV craft a sound that is at once familial and frost-bitten.  Indebted to classic kraut, dreamy Creation-records psychedelia, and the primitive-crunch of late-80&#39;s Seattle, the band walk a divisive yet perfectly fused patch of classic-underground influence.

One part THC and two parts MDMA; the first offering from DIIV chemically fuses the reminiscent with the half-remembered building a musical world out of old-air and new breeze.  These are songs that remind us of love in all it&#39;s earthly perfections and perversions.

A lot of DIIV&#39;s magnetism was birthed in the process Mr. Smith went through to discover these initial compositions.  After returning from a US tour with Beach Fossils, Cole made a bold creative choice, settling into the window-facing corner of a painter&#39;s studio in Bushwick, sans running water, holing up to craft his music.

In this AC-less wooden room, throughout the thick of the summer, Cole surrounded himself with cassettes and LP&#39;s, the likes of Lucinda Williams, Arthur Russell, Faust, Nirvana, and Jandek; writings of N. Scott Momaday, James Welsh, Hart Crane, Marianne Moore, and James Baldwin; and dreams of aliens, affection, spirits, and the distant natural world (as he imagined it from his window facing the Morgan L train).

The resulting music is as cavernous as it is enveloping, asking you to get lost in it&#39;s tangles in an era that demands your attention be focused into 140 characters.

                                        The early 1980s weren&#39;t the best of times to be an aspiring guitar player. Twenty years earlier, the head of Decca records, Dick Rowe, had made the biggest A&amp;R gaff in pop history with the legendary clanger &quot;Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr Epstein&quot;. But in 1982, Rowe&#39;s apocalyptic prophecy suddenly sounded frighteningly real. After the initial roar and storm of punk, British pop music had succumbed to a synthesizer-driven pursuit of new waves and new romanticisms. In an age of Vienna&#39;s, Tainted Love&#39;s and Too Shy&#39;s, the pure sound of six-stringed, melodic pop - be it as amorous as The Beatles, as lascivious as The Stones or as giddy as T.Rex - was fast becoming a lost cause with few willing to fight its corner.

That all changed with Johnny Marr.

Born in Manchester on Halloween 1963, of Irish heritage, Marr&#39;s earliest musical memories are the get-togethers of his extended family, perhaps - as his early guitar idol Marc Bolan would sing - dancing himself out of the womb to the traditional strains of Black Velvet Band. As a child he&#39;d be spellbound by his parents&#39; record collection: the forlorn dramas of Del Shannon, the prison doldrums of Johnny Cash and the heart-popping bliss of his mother&#39;s Four Tops singles. All these influences would linger at the back of the boy Marr&#39;s brain, waiting for the command to attack his finger tips at a later date.

That date finally came during the early summer of 1982 when Marr, just 18 years-old, formed The Smiths after seeking out the reclusive and elusive Stretford poet, Morrissey. Musically, the sound of The Smiths was a guitar noise nostalgically familiar yet equally dumbfounding in its pristine newness. The tunes were giant, euphoric and instantaneous but woven together with such nimble flair it appeared as if the guitar was playing Marr instead of the other way round. Lost for words, early critics of the day undersold him with the words &quot;jingle&quot; and &quot;jangle&quot; when, had they tried, they might better have described the sound of Johnny Marr as that of Van Gogh&#39;s Starry Night in angry animation. Or the echo of diamonds raining down upon zinc-plated cobblestones. Or the sound of kitchen cutlery bouncing off a gaffer-taped Telecaster (which, ridiculous as it sounds, is how Marr achieved some of the resonant clangs in This Charming Man.)

                                        &ldquo;Can I make it clear?&rdquo; Lorely Rodriguez asks within the opening moments of her debut album, Me. If clarity is what she seeks, Lorely has found it: her voice upfront, every word audible and strong. Her singular voice is the centerpiece of Me, her first full-formed vision of an album, following her previously shorter and more abstract releases as Empress Of. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me who I am,&rdquo; she sings seconds later.

On a cold January morning, Lorely sits at the kitchen table at her current sublet apartment, sifting through a composition book, pages of lyrics stained by coffee and cognac, shuffling through photo prints from the trip to Mexico where she wrote the initial sketches of the record. The album is filtered through imagery from this 5-week retreat, a lens through which Lorely looks both inward and outward, reflects and looks forward, finds strength and vulnerability.

Where her previous recordings worked in moody abstractions, layered soundscapes hinting at a voice deep under the surface, Me plays out like diary entries from one female voice musing on the personal, the political, and all the middle ground between. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living below the standard with a hunger that feeds the fire / I&rsquo;ve been eyeing your plate of diamonds,&rdquo; sings Lorely on &ldquo;Standard&rdquo;, a reflection on privilege and entitlement.

Before and after, she sings candidly on street harassment and water scarcity, but mostly Lorely&rsquo;s lyrics are more introspective; songs of broken relationships, new ones starting, and ultimately, self-reliance. &ldquo;I just need myself, need myself, to love myself, to love myself,&rdquo; she sings on &ldquo;Need Myself&rdquo;.

In 2015, at age 25, Lorely has found herself traveled a long ways from her childhood. Born in L.A. into a family of immigrants from Honduras, she grew up on the music of Latin America, Mexico, El Salvador, and her family&rsquo;s country; music driven by rhythm, music to dance to, drums and bass. &ldquo;I started singing when I was 11, and was super into jazz,&rdquo; she says, recalling how as kid she would spend days searching the Internet for rare jazz recordings.

Obsessed with music, Lorely spent her childhood living between Pasadena and San Fernando Valley, attending a 10,000 person high school and multiple others before eventually being admitted to LACHSA, the LA county arts high school. She says it &ldquo;saved her.&rdquo; She became a competitive jazz singer, and after high school received a full-ride scholarship to an East Coast music school, but quickly rejected the formality of it all. &ldquo;My first semester of college, I got a laptop and was like, these jazz classes are such bullshit,&rdquo; Lorely says. &ldquo;I started making beats in Reason and just wanted to make electronic music and write songs.&rdquo;

Over the summer of 2013, Lorely finally channeled those impulses into a song-a-day project while living in Boston. Every day, she&rsquo;d sketch out a new song idea, make a scrappy home-recording, and post 1-minute YouTube videos she called &ldquo;colorminutes&rdquo;&mdash;little snippets of her gorgeous, ethereal pop songs set to different color screens. The mysteriousness intrigued certain corners of the underground music world and on blogs. &ldquo;I feel like artists today feel so determined to present a polished product and I just wanted to let people in to my personal process as a creator,&rdquo; she said an interview with the Boston Phoenix at the time.

A 7-inch would soon be released for her first proper 3-minute Empress Of Single, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Tell Me&rdquo;, which was adapted from one of the colorminutes. Soon after her first EP was released by Terrible Records who will also release Me. The industry immediately wanted to team her up with a producer, but Lorely felt like the whole process was drowning her voice out: &ldquo;It just ended up sounding like that person&rsquo;s music. I thought, &lsquo;this is my first record, I need it to sound like it&rsquo;s coming from me.&rsquo; At that point I decided, I&rsquo;m doing this myself.&rdquo;

The roots of Me start in an empty practice space in Brooklyn in the fall of 2013, where Lorely is dancing alone next to a little spinning silver disco ball. &ldquo;After touring the EP, I realized I wanted to make music that was fun to perform live,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;So as I was writing, I would make a beat and pretend I was performing.&rdquo; But ultimately the city put her in a less-than-inspired headspace: &ldquo;When I started writing it, a lot of the songs were about how much I hated living in New York, how much I hate capitalism, and Starbucks, and condos. And how every apartment has rats. I thought, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tour a record for two years that&rsquo;s about hating New York.&rsquo;&rdquo;

Her intuitive search for a more introspective and isolated writing experience led her to unexpectedly life-changing and mind-bending solo trip to Mexico, where she holed up at a friends&rsquo; family&rsquo;s empty lake house near Valle de Bravo&mdash;that means &ldquo;Valley of the Brave&rdquo; in Spanish. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best thing that ever happened to me as an artist, as a human,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I spent so much time writing. I had no internet, I barely had a phone. It was like being on a silent retreat.. It&rsquo;s in the middle of nowhere, an hour away from Mexico City. There are people there, people have vacation homes there, but it was during a season when nobody&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;

The isolation sent her deep inside her head, to pull out everything she wanted to pour into Me. &ldquo;Every lyric on the record, I could tell you exactly what I was doing when I wrote it,&rdquo; she says, flipping through an envelope of photos from the trip, which look more like postcards &ndash; a huge lake, big windows, a Monarch butterfly reserve in the backyard.

It&rsquo;s New Years Eve and Lorely is by herself in Mexico, alone on the lake with a pile of fireworks and thinking about water &ndash; the water around her, the water she can drink and can&rsquo;t drink, and &ldquo;Water Water&rdquo;, the song she was working on. &ldquo;I went into the village and bought tons of illegal fireworks and blew them off in the dark off a bridge by myself &hellip; I brought in 2014 making music, working on that track, and then I just made music the rest of the year.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Water water is a privilege, just like kids who go to college,&rdquo; she sings on the track. &ldquo;Water is this thing that&rsquo;s taken for granted, she says. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realize how badly you need it until there&rsquo;s no clean water coming from the faucet.&rdquo;

During the writing process of Me, the power in the village of Valle de Bravo would go out a lot, and she quickly had to teach herself how to make fires. &ldquo;The first night I was there the power in the village went out. I had to make a fire, but I didn&rsquo;t know how, so I threw a bunch of cognac onto wood and threw a match at it.&rdquo; And that was just one of the obstacles to overcome during a trip that was ultimately an enormous learning experience.

&ldquo;Kitty Kat&rdquo; was inspired by her experiences walking around Valle de Bravo and being cat called constantly &ndash; just like in New York. It&rsquo;s an aggressive track with huge drums taking down the seemingly inescapable social norm. &ldquo;I close the set with that song and I just scream,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my empowering moment live. I hope a lot of women feel empowered by it.&rdquo; And &ldquo;Threat&rdquo; was born out of a different type of fear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been by myself for two weeks,&rdquo; she says of her trip to Valle de Bravo. &ldquo;And had this really scary conversation with the cleaning lady one day. She seemed worried knowing I was there alone. I started sleeping with a machete I found in the laundry room under my bed.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Need Myself&rdquo; picks apart an old toxic relationship with an unresponsive partner, while &ldquo;Everything Is You&rdquo; details the beginning of a new one. &ldquo;How Do You Do it&rdquo; is a sex-positive, dance song about positive relationships, while &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; is a reflection on living in New York. The album&rsquo;s final track, &ldquo;Icon&rdquo;, is a metacommentary on the solitary process of writing a record: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonely, but I like having control of all my creative thoughts,&rdquo; she says.

&ldquo;I wanted to write songs that gave me this feeling of reliving moments, of looking at photos,&rdquo; says Lorely. &ldquo;As a musician I started out by hiding behind a bunch of reverb, layering my vocals because I was not a confident singer. I think that comes with being young and not being vulnerable. &hellip; There is a bunch of doubt that comes with putting yourself out there. Overcoming the doubt is a lot of what came out of writing these songs, writing these melodies and producing it myself.&rdquo;

&ldquo;This record is not about Mexico .. it&rsquo;s about me,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very much about my experiences. I learned how to let my voice out through this record. I learned how to record, how to produce. I learned how to write way better songs. I didn&rsquo;t realize this until i was almost done with it, but it was all about growth, and all about kind of being selfish and taking time for myself to really understand what events in my life have shaped me as a person.&rdquo;

                                        Inspired by their personal experiences with agoraphobia, sleepwalking, teeth grinding, time wasting, night terrors, toxic relationships, Web MD, and fucking up while trying to be better people, Wavves&#39; fifth full length studio album V sees the fuzzy LA noise pop outfit move into more mature, slightly hopeful territory, as they recognize that the momentary nihilism caused by their wicked hangover will soon end, thereby creating room for more and hopefully less wicked hangovers. &quot;It&#39;s not happy music, not at all,&quot; singer Nathan Williams assures, &quot;but it&#39;s inspired by learning to be happy about the shittiest lows, trying to express a realistic optimism in the knowledge that nothing is ever going to be perfect, and there will always be some fucked up shit in your life...but you can have a positive outlook on it, if you want.&quot; Hook-heavy and scrappy as ever, V is watershed album for Wavves on both a personal and musical level, wearing its bruised -- but humbled -- heart very much on its sleeve.

Featuring the previously released &quot;Way Too Much&quot; and &quot;Flamezesz&quot;, the 11-track LP was recorded in Los Angeles with the help of producer Woody Jackson (Daniel Johnston, Primal Scream, Tenacious D, Money Mark and Beck), who took the band&#39;s trademark distorted no-fi into crisper, even more visceral territory while still remaining true to their 90s influenced roots, which stem back to 2008 when Williams created two albums&#39; worth of work using &#39;80s Tascam cassette recorder and Garage Band software. The last seven years saw Wavves grow from bedroom experiment into Billboard Top 100 ranking four piece featuring Alex Gates (guitar, backing vocals), Stephen Pope (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Brian Hill (drums), all of whom contributed to the writing of V, which is set for an October 2nd release through Ghost Ramp/Warner Bros. V marks the high point in an exceptionally busy year for the band-2015 has seen an LP collaboration with Cloud Nothings&#39; Dylan Baldi, a GZA collab with Williams&#39; side project Sweet Valley called &quot;Planetary Energy&quot;, and releases by Courtney Love and Spirit Club (his side project with brother Joel Williams and Jeans Wilder) on Williams&#39; Ghost Ramp label.

The band&#39;s first solo album since 2013&#39;s Afraid of Heights, the songs on V were inspired by a dark and epic Waiting for Godot-esque idle stretch of around eight months that occurred in between the end of the Afraid of Heights tour and the recording of V. Caught in a creative and emotional stasis, the band had &quot;way too much time on their hands&quot;, leading to the kind of bored, compulsive partying that was no longer about having fun, but about &quot;just drinking, straight drinking,&quot; with 100 beers and two bottles of Jameson the per night band norm. Bassist Stephen Pope developed a mild agoraphobia, and became scared to leave his bedroom. &quot;I would order pizza almost everyday and hide in my room and pee in a bottle like in &#39;The Aviator&#39;&quot;. 

Williams tried to cut back on his drug and alcohol consumption, but fewer beers per day resulted in night terrors, as he adjusted to not being drunk every night. &quot;I get a two day hangover if I do drugs now, and you have to think &#39;is this worth it?&#39; I feel like that romanticized druggie alcoholism lifestyle is a sham.&quot; Then came the paranoia about his health. &quot;You can just ruin your own life by spending too much time on Web MD, convincing yourself you have cancer,&quot; he said. 

On top of all that, he was going through a breakup-no surprise, failed relationships are a major theme on the record. The song Heart Attack, for instance, is about &quot;doing anything for a girl, making decisions that you probably wouldn&#39;t normally make in an almost masochistic way. It&#39;s like putting yourself in harm&#39;s way, which I tend to do physically and emotionally. Sometimes that means I find it hard to think the best of people, although I am softening more over time.&quot; All The Same is about a loose series of negative events that occurred in Williams&#39; life and acknowledging that sometimes &quot;shit doesn&#39;t work out, but in the end the people that you love around you are what&#39;s the important part&quot;. Pony&#39;s chorus, &quot;it gets better and better&quot;, reiterates the &#39;light at the end of the tunnel&#39; narrative that emerges, perhaps for the first time in Wavves career, in V. 

By the time they got into the studio, the band members had gone through so much personal upheaval that it was a relief to start working again. The energy of the sessions was &quot;a lot lighter and not as drunk&quot; as on prior records, as V became something of a conduit for the kinds of feels that they wouldn&#39;t usually feel comfortable talking about. The album artwork -- the five of cups, the Tarot card of greatest loss -- sums it up, the cloaked figure mourning the three spilled cups, while two are still full behind him. The message is clear: don&#39;t cry over spilled beer, because there are two more right behind you. &quot;We&#39;ve never talked about this stuff in front of each other, outside the music,&quot; admits Williams. &quot;&#39;Cause guys are afraid to talk. It&#39;s not like we say &quot;Dude, I&#39;m feeling sad today.&quot; You know? That&#39;s lame, dude.&quot;

                                        California Nights is a brighter, more sparkly, more sophisticated, more psychedelic Best Coast album across the board, embodying the rich lightness and stinging darkness of a California state of mind. The love stories Bethany spins on California Nights all detail the highs and the lows of relationships, similar to the juxtaposition of a the band&#39;s native Los Angeles &ndash; a place tinted by candy-colored palm trees and pale blue skies while existing within the loneliness and desperation of waterless place. More than that, there is a literal meaning to the record&#39;s title &ndash; Cosentino is a well-documented insomniac whose creativity spirals out in the early hours of the morning, allowing her to write, undisturbed, the finest album Best Coast has made to date.

BETHANY COSENTINO on CALIFORNIA NIGHTS: 

If you have ever lived in California, you know what nighttime here feels like. You know what the sky looks like when those epic sunsets begin, and you understand that feeling and the way things change when the sun finally sets. In LA, or maybe just personally to me, when the sun sets &ndash; I feel like there is a large sense of calmness in the air, and I feel like everything that happened to me prior in the day, whether crappy experiences or good ones, at night, it all goes away and I sink deep into this different kind of &quot;world.&quot; 

When we decided to name the record California Nights, it just felt right because there is not only a song on the album &ndash; one of the biggest, most different songs we&#39;ve written &ndash; with the same name, but because I do so much of my thinking and creative work at night. It also ties in with the idea that, as natives of LA, Bobb and I know a lot of spots and places within and around the city that a lot of people don&#39;t really know or care to know. There is a grittiness to Los Angeles that isn&#39;t seen via &quot;E! Live At The Red Carpet.&quot; There is a darkness in this city that you don&#39;t see unless you know where to look. I think that to an outsider, California, or more specifically Los Angeles, seems like it&#39;s this amazing place with perfect weather and sunny skies with just the right amount of clouds and tall palm trees. And let&#39;s face it, it kind of is &ndash; but there are also a lot of other things here &mdash; crime, homelessness, and some of the most spirit-crushing elements of the entertainment industry that outsiders never see. That&#39;s a theme we very consciously decided to explore and play with when making this record. We related to the idea that things may LOOK or SOUND fun and upbeat, but they may not actually always BE that way &ndash; much like our songs. 

Writing this album, for me, was a way of taking myself though a step by step journey of learning so much about myself and the world around me. By the end of it, I got to a place where I was able to come to terms with just how much I can control, and how much I can&#39;t &mdash; with the dichotomy of fun vs. dark; happy vs. sad; crazy vs. sane; anxiety vs. calm; perfect vs. screwed up. I realized that I am, more often than not, the creator of my own anxiety and my own stress, and throughout this album, I talk to myself about that and challenge myself to cut the bullshit and just be okay with being okay. 

I have definitely been the cause for a lot of my own problems in life, and this is something that I am 100% able to own up to and admit. I may not have been able to admit that 5 years ago, when I started this band at age 23, but I can see it now and I can address it, so I decided to try and build a record around that idea. I understand that no one and nothing will ever be perfect, but I also realize that THAT is okay and it&#39;s just a part of life. 

A lot of the writing for this record consisted of me getting to know myself again and remembering where Bethany ended and Best Coast began. I took a much needed step back and I was able to breathe deep for a moment and really focus on what I was doing. The end result of all of that, is California Nights. It&#39;s about a journey, it&#39;s about self acceptance, it&#39;s about learning to let go, it&#39;s about accepting the things you have no control over, it&#39;s about dealing with life like an adult and at the end of the day reminding yourself that there really is no reason to be sad, and you have every right to feel okay.

                                        Ribbon Music is pleased to announce the return of Baltimore&rsquo;s Lower Dens with their third album, Escape from Evil.

On Escape From Evil, Lower Dens&rsquo; Jana Hunter emerges: cerebral and hot-blooded, rash and incorruptible, and, crucially, possessing of a loud, clear voice. The album sees Hunter stepping up and taking center stage, and emboldening every aspect of the band.

Escape From Evil is a cinematic, tonally rich work. The sounds are clean and warm. The pulse of the album is strong. Melodies are potent and songs are physical. Lyrics are direct, frank confrontations with life&rsquo;s common crises. The album title is brazen, and along with the grimly funny title of lead single, &ldquo;To Die in L.A.&rdquo;, almost theatrical.

Lower Dens&rsquo; 2010 debut, Twin-Hand Movement, was a stunning evolution of guitar brilliance and murky emotiveness, while its 2012 follow-up, Nootropics, was a stark, textured paean to experimental bands of the krautrock era. Escape From Evil marks a bold, monumental step forward for the band and the welcome manifestation of a singer we&rsquo;ve never quite seen until now.

                                        Jet Plane and Oxbow, Shearwater&#39;s second original full-length for Sub Pop, is their career-defining album-the leap forward those of us who&#39;ve been watching them for years have always believed they would make. Lush, powerful, and grand, with a confident edge heard more often in their live shows than on record, it feels like the musical statement they&#39;ve been working toward through five albums and a decade on the road. It&#39;s an album that captures the light and darkness of our time through the lens of one of our most unique and, for a growing number of ardent fans, treasured bands.

This is definitely Shearwater&#39;s loudest record; it&#39;s easy to imagine these songs roaring from the stage. But it&#39;s also, strangely, their most intricate and beautiful one. Front man Jonathan Meiburg and producer/engineer Danny Reisch (who also recorded 2012&#39;s Animal Joy and the off-the-cuff collaborations of 2014&#39;s Fellow Travelers) spent two years crafting Jet Plane and Oxbow in studios in Austin and Los Angeles, with help from drummer Cully Symington, longtime Shearwater associates Howard Draper and Lucas Oswald, and tourmates Abram Shook, Jesca Hoop and Jenn Wasner.

But their secret weapon this time is film composer and percussionist Brian Reitzell, whose credits include The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation, The Bling Ring, and 30 Days of Night. Reitzell&#39;s arsenal of strange instruments and equipment emphasizes the album&#39;s cinematic depth and scope, and reflects the band&#39;s choice to anchor the record in the era when digital technology was just beginning to transform the world of recorded music. In Shearwater&#39;s hands, this doesn&#39;t feel like nostalgia; the racing synths and hammered dulcimers of heart-pounding opener &quot;Prime&quot; or the addled motorik of &quot;Radio Silence&quot; sound more like a metaphor for our own technologically bewildered moment.

Lyrically, Meiburg describes Jet Plane and Oxbow as a protest record (see attached interview); the title comes from a moment when he looked out of a 737 as another plane, passing below, bisected a loop of the Mississippi. In recent years, Meiburg&#39;s been working as a writer as well as a musician, but he doesnt seem distracted here; in fact, hes never sounded more present on record. His voice is urgent, angry, and tender by turns, and the songs are as multilayered as the production. &quot;Quiet Americans&quot;, the obvious single, wraps a deep ambivalence inside a call to arms; Only Child, perhaps the most straightforward song Meiburg&#39;s ever written, is shot through with warmth even as it describes a life fracturing under pressure. And though the album begins in closeup: (and you were lying on your back in the grass/counting backward from a thousand) it ends wide, as &quot;Stray Light at Clouds Hill&quot; evokes the dark side of the earth-luminous, eerie, and vast. Shearwater have always worked on a huge canvas, but with Jet Plane and Oxbow, their reach finally equals their grasp.

Shearwater begin touring in Europe in February 2016, and the United States in March.

                                        For mercurial L.A. music-maker Will Wiesenfeld, Baths has been a long time coming. The 21-year-old has spent the better part of his days living amidst &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; and &ldquo;unremarkable&rdquo; in the suburbs of the San Fernando Valley, so perhaps it&rsquo;s due to a general lack of local inspiration that Wiesenfeld&rsquo;s own work has never fit into a prefab box of its own. Over the last six years, under the handle of [Post-Foetus], Wiesenfeld has gainfully explored the intersections and outer reaches of both electronic and acoustic music. With Baths, his eclecticism finds its greatest focus yet, in a hail of lush melodies, ghostly choirs, playful instrumentation and stuttering beats.

Wiesenfeld&rsquo;s trip began at age 4, when he willed his parents into enrolling him in piano lessons. (The family upright, purchased that same year, sits in his bedroom today.) By 13, he&rsquo;d begun artisting his own music using Digital Performer and a MIDI keyboard &ndash; a brief, ill-advised foray into Eurobeat that was set right when Wiesenfeld heard Bjork for the first time. Mind blown, he quickly boned up on viola, contrabass, and guitar and took the name [Post-Foetus], stringing together countless live configurations to execute his increasingly inimitable compositions. [Post-Foetus]&rsquo; fourth album &ndash; a Dntel-ish, song-based melange dubbed The Fabric &ndash; was released on Mu-Nest in January.

Though Baths represents the next evolution in Wiesenfeld&rsquo;s oeuvre &ndash; which also includes the excellent ambient project Geotic &ndash; it came together under nigh-opposite circumstances. Last September, [Post-Foetus] was invited by L.A. electronicist Daedelus to share a bill with a handful of local Beat Music luminaries. Witnessing a burgeoning movement firsthand sparked something in Wiesenfeld that the &lsquo;burbs never could. In a fit of inspiration, Baths was born, though not into a preexisting scene. As is to be expected, this music goes its own way: fueled by spontaneity, tempered by Wiesenfeld&rsquo;s background in classic songwriting. Those two influences collide in glorious ways on Cerulean, Baths&rsquo; stunning debut.

                                        St. Lucia is BACK with an infectious new single &ldquo;Dancing On Glass&rdquo; and a brand new album Matter. And with those comes a series of North American dates, following up on the band&rsquo;s sold out fall 2014 headline tour. 

St. Lucia&rsquo;s 2013 debut LP When The Night earned raves everywhere from Entertainment Weekly (&ldquo;an absolute smash&rdquo;) to Elle (&ldquo;we have an obsession for this group&rdquo;) to Billboard (&ldquo;essential listening&rdquo;).  The last two years have also seen the band touring with the likes of Ellie Goulding, Empire Of The Sun, Charli XCX, Foster The People, performed at Coachella and Lollapalooza, and appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!,  and Late Night With Seth Meyers.

                                        New View, the third solo album by Eleanor Friedberger, was rehearsed in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park and recorded in upstate New York. The former is a place where characters in Warren Zevon songs get clingy with their old lady while toughing out heroin withdrawal; the latter is where Bob Dylan got clingy with Robbie Robertson after flying off his motorcycle and revisiting the highway with his face. Fittingly, there&#39;s a fair amount of recovery in the songs of New View (though you won&#39;t find much in the way of smack or motorcycles). &quot;Today I&#39;m frozen but tomorrow I&#39;ll write about you,&quot; Friedberger sings, and much of the album seems set in that post-traumatic tomorrow, when stuff&#39;s calmed down, the figurative road rash has healed, the metaphorical junkie sweating up your mattress has finally packed his bags. 

Counting the albums she made with her brother Matthew as the Fiery Furnaces, this is Friedberger&#39;s twelfth full-length. I&#39;ve been listening since the beginning, and to me New View seems like just that -- a vista that&#39;s opened up when I thought I&#39;d seen everything Friedberger had to offer. (Then again, I believed her last album Personal Record was indeed her best to date, so maybe I&#39;m just susceptible to album titles.) Before she entered the studio with New View producer Clemens Knieper, Friedberger made a playlist of reference songs. A live version of &quot;Warm Love&quot; by Van Morrison was on there, as was 80s-era Dylan, Neil Young at his most bummed out, a scattering of Robert Wyatt-era Soft Machine, and the odd gem by Slapp Happy, Fleetwood Mac, Funkadelic, et al. There are ghost notes of all of those influences on New View, but mostly you hear Eleanor Friedberger. She&#39;s never lacked confidence -- this is someone who once took a fractured nine-minute ballad about the international blueberry trade and put it across like it was &quot;Thunder Road&quot; -- but there&#39;s a new kind of confidence on this record. You can hear it on the warm, stately &quot;Your Word,&quot; which holds a special place for Friedberger. She says:

&quot;It was the last song I wrote for the album.  I finished the lyrics with lines taken from a dream that Jonathan Rosen had about me.  I stayed at a friend&#39;s house in LA who had a bunch of later George Harrison CDs-- already a huge fan, I thought I knew it all.  But I heard &#39;Love Comes To Everyone&#39; and it kind of blew me away.  Everything I love about Harrison-- beautiful slide guitar and vocals and vaguely spiritual lyrics-- plus a weird disco thing.  That was the big influence for the sound.&quot;

The songs on New View were recorded live to tape with simple instrumentation: drums, bass, Wurlitzer and 12-string acoustic guitar on almost every track, courtesy of the band Icewater (Malcolm Perkins, Jonathan Rosen, Michael Rosen, Noah Hecht), with Dorian DeAngelo contributing a handful of well-placed guitar solos. Producer Knieper (son of Jurgen Knieper, the German composer whose credits include the score to Wim Wenders&#39; Wings of Desire) gives the album a classic sound, like something that&#39;s existed forever on a record collector&#39;s shelf, wedged in with Dylan&#39;s New Morning and John Cale&#39;s Vintage Violence. 

For everything new about New View, it still fits comfortably in the continuity of Friedberger&#39;s work. By coincidence, Knieper&#39;s studio in Germantown, NY where the album was recorded is in a barn that was once rented by Matthew Friedberger and stored the furniture of their grandmother -- the same grandmother whose spoken word reminiscences were the basis of the Fiery Furnaces LP Rehearsing My Choir. You won&#39;t hear much of that album here, but songs like &quot;Open Season&quot; recall the Furnaces at their most magisterial. The wry, plainspoken &quot;Because I Asked You&quot; builds on the style Friedberger first polished on her solo debut Last Summer. And then there&#39;s &quot;A Long Walk,&quot; the sun-striped finale that lends a memorable afterglow to New View. It&#39;s a sweet, aching goodbye from an album that seems full of them.

                                        Firmly a phenomenon in their home country of Iceland, the four-piece band Kaleo is set to descend upon foreign shores in 2015, bringing their gorgeous blend of folk, blues, country, and rock to a wider mainstream audience in America. Their isolated heritage inspires a unique take on familiar sonic elements, resulting in diversity and freedom on each and every breathtaking track.

Best friends since attending elementary school in the small town of Mosfellsbaer outside of Reykjavik, bandleader JJ Juliusson, drummer David Antonsson, and bassist Danny Kristjansson began playing cover songs together at the age of 18. Honing their skills with the songs of others, they began writing their own music and gigged around the nation&#39;s capital for a few years, playing countless shows before adding guitarist Rubin Pollack to the mix in 2012. They named the band Kaleo, which means &quot;the sound&quot; in Hawaiian, and started their career in earnest with a handful of well-received shows at the 2012 Iceland Airwaves music festival.

They recorded their first pair of original songs in early 2013, the fiery &quot;Rock N Roller&quot; and laid-back, bluesy &quot;Pour Sugar On Me,&quot; which earned Kaleo some radio airplay and press in Iceland. Then, that spring, their cover of the traditional Icelandic ballad &quot;Vor &iacute; vaglask&oacute;gi&quot; during a live radio show was videotaped and posted to YouTube, where it quickly went viral. The band recorded a studio version of the song in June, which went straight to Number One in virtually every radio station in the country. &quot;It&#39;s a different kind of cover, more dramatic and the tempo is taken down,&quot; says JJ. &quot;We had played it for friends and people seemed to react to it. I always liked the old song; somehow it spoke to me.&quot; The buzz for Kaleo had begun; in fact, the video&#39;s views now number greater than the entire population of Iceland.

The band signed to Iceland&#39;s largest record label, Sena, in the fall of 2013 and recorded their full-length debut, Kaleo, in just six short weeks. Five singles would reach Number One and the album would go Gold, receiving high praise and sending the band to shows and festivals in Europe over the next year, including an appearance on the biggest stage in their home country, Culture Night, where they played to 100,000 people and reached 90 percent of Iceland&#39;s population in broadcast. Then, in the spring of 2014, Kaleo recorded the lush, introspective song &quot;All the Pretty Girls&quot; and in one night their destiny to outgrow their small, island nation was cemented.

&quot;It&#39;s different from the others, a very delicate song. It seemed to speak to a lot of people,&quot; says JJ. &quot;From there everything started to happen. We got contacted from other places: managers, labels, publishers&mdash;they all went crazy over one night.&quot; Drawn to Kaleo&#39;s multi-layered dynamics, their ability to play different genres with equal skill, the vocals and mood reminiscent of everything from Bon Iver and Iron &amp; Wine to Coldplay and David Gray, and wise-beyond-their-years songwriting, the world came calling.

Now, signed to Atlantic Records in the US, Kaleo has moved to Austin, Texas, and will begin recording new material with producer Mike Crossey (Arctic Monkeys, Jake Bugg) in London for an EP due this year. Get ready for the sound.

                                        It is said that society has lost its way. We have all but entirely lost hope in the possibility of revolutionary progress instigated by the young people of Jamaica. The pessimists have yet to consider the notorious innovation of Jamaicans, that therein lies a rich history of focusing and refocusing in perilous times, pinpointing the tiny loopholes and then widening them into gaping gaps for not only Jamaicans to see the truth, but the entire world. This is what a certain exciting breakthrough musician has committed himself to doing. His name... Protoje.   Born in the 80&#39;s but wishing he was birthed in the 60&#39;s, Protoje (Oje Ollivierre) is the fresh face with the freshest lyrical delivery, still having a feel of vintage reggae music but being a suitable update for the present time.   Indeed, Marley&#39;s mantra was to &quot;free the people with music.&quot; Protoje&#39;s mantra is to free the people with art. Music &ndash; his appointed contribution to the artistic revolution - is only one of the many distinct art forms. He takes up the mantle of spokesperson for the Movement and represents the evident unity among a large group of talented musical, literary and visual artists who have silently and patiently developed under the radar and are about to march together into a new era of prosperity for all.   Despite being the cousin of regular chart-topping producer, Donovan &#39;Don Corleon&#39; Bennett, Protoje continues to resist the urge to lay his vocals on every other riddim in the dancehall mainstream. He is meticulously piecing together his debut album, The Seven Year Itch, while focusing the rest of his efforts on the perfection of his live performances. Already, a pattern has been detected whereby Protoje invariably sees a significant hike in his fan base the day after his last performance. This invokes the truth in the saying, &quot;you have to see to believe.&quot;   Rolling with Protoje is rolling with the Movement

                                        The formation of The Revivalists was all about chance, but everything since then has been a combination of hard work, awesome music, and friendship. The septet has been playing nonstop since 2007, crafting a genre-hopping sound that rounds out traditional rock instrumentation with horns and pedal steel guitar and mixes the divergent backgrounds of its individual members with the humid, funky undercurrents of the band&rsquo;s New Orleans home. The result is like English spoken with an exotic accent: familiar, yet difficult to pin down.

Religion aside, a revival is all about the tangible electricity that can only be created when enough like minds are crammed under a single roof for a singular purpose. It&rsquo;s a spiritual spectacle, a carnival of the divine, a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The same could be said for The Revivalists&rsquo; searing live performances. The band has a knack for bringing music to life on a stage, and they have tuned their talents to Swiss-watch precision over years of relentless touring. Their bombastic showmanship is the outgrowth of a desire to connect with audiences on a personal level, and that intimate connection is what elevates their shows above simple entertainment.

True to their name, The Revivalists lean more heavily on the older styles and warmer sounds of the golden age of rock &lsquo;n roll, but the band isn&rsquo;t afraid to dabble in electronics and sleight-of-studio when it&rsquo;s right for the song. The group tends not to bother with questions like &ldquo;does this sound like us?&rdquo; or &ldquo;does this fit with our other stuff?&rdquo;, instead allowing songs to define themselves and take shape organically, each on its own terms. Is this a dark, heavy rock manifesto driven by a steel guitar line that borders on electronica, or is it an airy, acoustic story about star-crossed lovers, rich in vocal harmony and sparsely arranged until the coda? This one&rsquo;s funky, that one&rsquo;s sweet, this one&rsquo;s heavy&hellip; To The Revivalists, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. They just write songs that they want to play.

                                        The formation of The Revivalists was all about chance, but everything since then has been a combination of hard work, awesome music, and friendship. The septet has been playing nonstop since 2007, crafting a genre-hopping sound that rounds out traditional rock instrumentation with horns and pedal steel guitar and mixes the divergent backgrounds of its individual members with the humid, funky undercurrents of the band&rsquo;s New Orleans home. The result is like English spoken with an exotic accent: familiar, yet difficult to pin down.

Religion aside, a revival is all about the tangible electricity that can only be created when enough like minds are crammed under a single roof for a singular purpose. It&rsquo;s a spiritual spectacle, a carnival of the divine, a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The same could be said for The Revivalists&rsquo; searing live performances. The band has a knack for bringing music to life on a stage, and they have tuned their talents to Swiss-watch precision over years of relentless touring. Their bombastic showmanship is the outgrowth of a desire to connect with audiences on a personal level, and that intimate connection is what elevates their shows above simple entertainment.

True to their name, The Revivalists lean more heavily on the older styles and warmer sounds of the golden age of rock &lsquo;n roll, but the band isn&rsquo;t afraid to dabble in electronics and sleight-of-studio when it&rsquo;s right for the song. The group tends not to bother with questions like &ldquo;does this sound like us?&rdquo; or &ldquo;does this fit with our other stuff?&rdquo;, instead allowing songs to define themselves and take shape organically, each on its own terms. Is this a dark, heavy rock manifesto driven by a steel guitar line that borders on electronica, or is it an airy, acoustic story about star-crossed lovers, rich in vocal harmony and sparsely arranged until the coda? This one&rsquo;s funky, that one&rsquo;s sweet, this one&rsquo;s heavy&hellip; To The Revivalists, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. They just write songs that they want to play.

                                        Mortality. It&rsquo;s the primary reason we don&rsquo;t live forever. If not for our mortality, the number of years each of us would have to roam this earth would be as infinite as the sands of time running through the earth itself. When extraterrestrials eventually make first contact with us within the next twenty years, the first glaringly obvious thing they will notice...is that we die. They will come to our planet with sinister intentions and they will immediately have the upper hand because we die...and they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a simple as that. And it&rsquo;s all because of our mortality. 

While aliens (and the government!!!!!) will always be there to kill us, we have for generations used our cold dead hands to clutch onto whatever silver lining we could sew into the dark cloud of our everlasting mortality. Specifically, we tell ourselves that we can live forever, not in corporeal form, but through our creations of art...and our expressions of love. 

Thusly, art and love are more important than ever, because they are now the conduits that preserve our life forces. If you don&rsquo;t create art and you don&rsquo;t love nobody...well then, you will be forgotten, rather quickly. No one wants to be forgotten rather quickly. No one more so...than Electric Six.
 
Electric Six understands all this stuff as it prepares to unveil its eleventh studio album Bitch, Don&rsquo;t Let Me Die!, which will be released on October 2 on Metropolis Records. The album is steeped in themes of mortality, death, discorporation and discoloration...all while it tries to convince you it is actually a work of art, a labour of love.

From the pounding, driving opener, &ldquo;Drone Strikes&rdquo;, through the 1970s guitar anthem &ldquo;Two Dollar Two&rdquo;, Bitch, Don&rsquo;t Let Me Die! reveals that Electric Six knows that it is going to die, but will not go out quietly. From there, the album moves through the pop goodness of &ldquo;Kids Are Evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Variation of Elaine&rdquo;, the prog-rock showmanship of &ldquo;Slow Motion Man&rdquo;, and even a tribute to Elvis Presley in his more rotund years with &ldquo;Dime Dime Penny Dime&rdquo;. 

&ldquo;Big Red Arthur&rdquo; is the anchor track of the album, as it emits a rock-opera bombast that is reminiscent of Radiohead sodomizing David Bowie in the center of his mind. It, like most of the songs on this record, is about death...but it&rsquo;s kind of funny because it&rsquo;s only about the death of a fake, out-of-shape drunk Santa Claus who is too fucking stupid to make it down the chimney correctly. In this case, we just end up laughing at death. And that&rsquo;s uplifting. 

To summarize, mortality is everywhere, and this fall, thanks to their new record Bitch, Don&rsquo;t Let Me Die!, Electric Six will be everywhere too. Everybody gonna die someday, 
but with Electric Six&rsquo;s new album, you no longer have to worry about any of it. Bitch, Don&rsquo;t Let Me Die is Electric Six&rsquo;s brand new record for 2015 and it is available on Metropolis Records on Oct. 2. You can come see Electric Six play in your town on the I Wanna Lick The Screen tour, starting in their home state of Michigan on Sept. 25.

                                        Critically acclaimed pop duo Chairlift has released new music in the form of the infinitely danceable &ldquo;Ch-Ching.&rdquo; The R&amp;B laced, vibrating drum infused pop track serves as the first musical offering from their forthcoming album Moth, which will be released in January 2016 via Columbia Records. Although the single is the first work to be released from Chairlift in three years, the duo &ndash; comprised of writer/producers and multi-instrumentalists Caroline Polachek and Patrick Wimberly &ndash; has hardly been quiet. They collaborated with Beyonc&eacute; on her groundbreaking self-titled album via the track &ldquo;No Angel,&rdquo; which was written and produced by Caroline and co-produced by Patrick. Caroline released and toured Arcadia, a self-produced solo album under the alias Ramona Lisa and collaborated with SBTRKT, Blood Orange and others, while Patrick produced and collaborated with artists such as Solange Knowles, Wet, Kelela, and Tei Shi.

An evolution from their last album, 2012&rsquo;s Something, Moth proves to be an emotionally uninhibited and markedly stronger, more pop inspired body of work. A very New York City inspired album, listeners can expect to be led through an aural mix of big, rich pop inspired hooks, vibrating bass, lively brass and sensuous R&amp;B inspired vocals, all anchored in the duo&rsquo;s meticulously crafted instrumentation.

                                        Plaza is the third album by Quilt; a name implying a meeting place, a crossroads, a coming together. In the space of ten songs, Plaza clarifies Quilt&#39;s musical stance of a congregation, mixing folk, pop-psych, and wanderlust into a common ground where each form takes on the characteristics of one another to create something wholly satisfying, styles and sentiments hand in hand, the purest and sharpest distillation of Quilt&#39;s group aesthetic to date.

Plaza came together through the happy collisions of friends, family, and well-wishers, individuals who came to realize that home for one is escape for another. Quilt had made its home on the road for the better part of 2014, coming to rest in Atlanta for three weeks by a collaborator of sorts. A bizarre cosmic boomerang had led them here: while on tour in Oregon, the band randomly met a man named Matt Arnett who turned out to be responsible, along with his father, for the &quot;Quilts of Gee&#39;s Bend&quot; traveling art exhibition from which many of the quilts were sourced as visual material for Quilt&#39;s first record in 2011. The serendipitous meeting led the group to stay in touch with Arnett, who in turn invited the group to start demoing and constructing new material at his Grocery On Home; the historic building near Atlanta&#39;s Grant Park district in which Arnett hangs his hat.

                                        Murder By Death will release a new album Big Dark Love on February 3rd, 2015 on Bloodshot Records (pre-order available here). This is the band&rsquo;s seventh full-length album and first since their 2012 Bloodshot debut Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon.

For a band that has built its formidable, nearly 15-year career around a meticulous consideration for the effects of pressure, release, bombast, ecstasy, and highest-highs vs. lowest-lows, it is something to say that this is Murder By Death&rsquo;s most dynamic release to date. On their seventh full-length album and first since their 2012 Bloodshot debut Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon, the band&rsquo;s signature sound (rootsy indie rock, cinematic gothic ballads, and rousing pub rock shout-alongs) mixes with enlivening new stylistic elements (touches of pop, synth-y electronics, and psych rock) only hinted at on previous albums. 

Big Dark Love reflects a different, bigger, more complex side of Murder By Death. As hinted in the title, the 10 songs circle a central theme of love, only in this case, the oft-traveled topic is examined through non-traditional kaleidoscopes: the love of a parent for their child, the struggle between unconditional love and morality, loving to excess. Throughout life, as in song, there can sometimes be a dusky patina of despair overlaying glints of hope.

What characterizes the album is the tension inherent in a balancing act between the melancholic and the inspirational - much like signature Spiritualized or Morphine - and textures both synthetic and authentic in a way that late &lsquo;90s-era Flaming Lips hadn&rsquo;t figured out yet. The opener &ldquo;I Shot an Arrow&rdquo; leads with a romantically sullen warmth of shapely electric bass and swaying synth chords, backed by a boomy groove laid down by drummer Dagan Thogerson. Lead singer/guitarist Adam Turla pounces between notes and commands with his gravelly timbre, &ldquo;I had a dream too big for the world/ Get me out of here/ Take me to the edge of town/ To the underground/ It can&rsquo;t be that far.&rdquo;

Elsewhere, there are currents of lustrous simplicity: take the pop-affected magnetism as heard in the fanfare of punchy horn lines supplied by keys/horns/auxiliary player and new addition David Fountain in &ldquo;Solitary One&rdquo; and Turla&rsquo;s heat-seeking vocal harmonies and show-stopping high notes of &ldquo;Send Me Home.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last Thing&rdquo; is ruminative, driving folk, propelled by banjo, jangly acoustic guitar, tambourine, and Matt Armstrong&rsquo;s charging bass. And later, &ldquo;Natural Pearl&rdquo; scuffles along like a punk rock Flying Burrito Brothers, replete with weepy pedal steel and dancing snare pattern.

Through all sounds and textures, sometimes it is the space between the notes that makes Big Dark Love so deep. The vast dynamics take on new meaning through layered, far-ranging and deftly orchestrated songwriting of the album title-track and &ldquo;It Will Never Die.&rdquo; The sonic panorama features a minimalist backdrop of warbly synth, Sarah Balliet&rsquo;s melodic intertwining cello lines, and seismic shifts from a cavernous hush to a climatic, soaring summit, full of Explosions In The Sky reverb and a chest-thumping low end. 

Big Dark Love was recorded at La La Land in Louisville, KY in the summer of 2014. It was produced by Murder By Death and Kevin Ratterman, and mixed by John Congleton.

                                        Greg Dulli began his musical career as the front man and guitarist for the pioneering band The Afghan Whigs in 1987. Praised by critics and fans alike, the band originally released six studio albums, before originally disbanding in the late 90&rsquo;s. Dulli went on to form The Twilight Singers, who have released five albums including the critically lauded Blackberry Belle, Powder Burns and Dynamite Steps in 2003, 2006 &amp; 2011 respectively.  In 2008, Dulli collaborated with close friend Mark Lanegan to form The Gutter Twins.

In 2012, The Afghan Whigs reunited for a massively successful tour that found them performing at major festivals like Lollapalooza, sharing the stage with Usher at SXSW, and selling out prestigious venues throughout the U.S., Europe, and Southern Hemisphere. The tour was then followed in 2014 by the release of the band&rsquo;s first new album in 16 years; the critically acclaimed Do to the Beast.

                                        Of course you don&rsquo;t need to attach more importance to this piece of news than it necessarily has, but it certainly deserves to be mentioned: for the first time in more than 20 years, one of the most British rock bands in music history has recorded a studio album in their native country. Their latest offering is entitled A Conspiracy Of Stars, was cut by rock legend UFO and breathes that typically British easy-going confidence for which this band has been known for over 45 years. A strong release consisting of eleven songs which combine everything that the group surrounding frontman Phil Mogg stands for: meaty riffs, distinctive hooks, diverse songwriting, intelligent lyrics and that generally laid-back attitude which we have associated with UFO from the start. The fact that A Conspiracy Of Stars was produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore, among others) may be considered  another successful element in a thoroughly consistent release. To cut a long story short: their  22nd studio recording to date sees UFO prove that past and present can be blended in a homogeneous whole.

A Conspiracy Of Stars presents UFO&rsquo;s current line-up for the first time: along with the original members, Phil Mogg (vocals), Paul Raymond (keyboards, guitar) and Andy Parker (drums), lead guitarist Vinnie Moore has been a permanent member of the group since 2004, American bassist Rob De Luca joining the fold in 2012. De Luca is not only a brilliant instrumentalist but has also contributed two of the album tracks as a songwriter. The majority of the new material was composed by Vinnie Moore, the album also featuring a song by Paul Raymond and a collaboration between Raymond and De Luca. The lyrics were penned by frontman Phil Mogg.

Talking of which: once again, Mogg proves his talent as a keen observer of the human species. Despite his exceptional position in the international rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll genre, the British vocalist has remained a man of the people. Mogg continues to be sympathetic to the working class, that&rsquo;s where his roots are, those are the people that the UFO singer continues to feel close to. Listening to UFO&rsquo;s new material, you can hear his origins in his songs, in his lyrics, which &ndash; despite plays on words and conscious ambiguities &ndash; prove his unconditional down-to-earthiness and produce wonderfully poetic phrases such as: &ldquo;The scatter rollers coming down, summers been and turned around, it don&rsquo;t seem so long ago, that you were my precious cargo,&rdquo; he sings on &lsquo;Precious Cargo&rsquo;, an equally subtle declaration of love as the number &lsquo;Killing Kind&rsquo;, which has Mogg kick off with the words: &ldquo;Tell a story about love and what lovers find, a story of possession, the killing kind.&rdquo; In view of so much verbal aesthetics it comes as no surprise that the UFO vocalist is appreciated the world over for his sensitive and carefully written lyrics. 

Lyrics and music for A Conspiracy Of Stars were written and composed in summer 2014. The band met for rehearsals at the Barn Room studios in Kent in mid-August before UFO moved a few miles further east to Chris Tsangarides&rsquo; Ecology Rooms studio, where they recorded their latest oeuvre, supported by the Greek Cypriot-British sound engineer, from late August until mid-September. Coincidentally, Tsangarides was working at the studio as a 14-year-old trainee when UFO recorded their debut album UFO 1 in England in 1970.

So everything&rsquo;s ready: A Conspiracy Of Stars is all wrapped up, the tour to support the album in spring 2015 has been booked, and UFO are ready to embark on the 22nd chapter of their career. Respect!

                                        After being a band for a decade, it&rsquo;s easy to get disillusioned with the tedium of adulthood, but Need Your Light, the fourth full-length from RaRa Riot, is the sound of a band being reinvigorated by their own existence. Correspondingly, the album sees the group&mdash;which originated in Syracuse but has now dispersed all over the country&mdash;getting back to their house party roots without abandoning the more heady soundscapes they explored with 2013&rsquo;s Beta Love. The result is an album that&rsquo;s celebratory without being saccharine, and that sees the group collectively mining their prior experiences to craft something that looks toward the future with an optimistic gaze.

The original plan was for the band&mdash;which features vocalist Wes Miles, bassist Mathieu Santos, guitarist Milo Bonacci, violinist Rebecca Zeller and drummer Kenny Bernard&mdash;to take the first extended break of their career after the year and a half they spent on the road supporting Beta Love. After a few months, however, they couldn&rsquo;t help themselves from working on new music. &ldquo;The inspiration came very quickly,&rdquo; Miles says, explaining that he decided to fly out to Los Angeles to start fleshing out ideas with previous producer Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse, Elvis Costello). Shortly afterward, the group went on a writing trip to Milwaukee and began the process of creating what would eventually become Need Your Light. To fully realize their vision, RaRaRiot ended up working with a host of previous collaborators, including Ryan Hadlock (who produced 2008&rsquo;s debut The Rhumb Line); longtime friend and sound engineer Andrew Maury (who co-produced 2010&rsquo;s The Orchard); and Vampire Weekend producer Rostam (who is also half of the avant garde R&amp;B duo Discovery alongside Miles).

In fact, Rostam and Miles&rsquo; approach to that liberating project&mdash;which released its debut LPin 2009&mdash;helped influence the end result ofNeed Your Light as well. &ldquo;In January of this year, Wes came to stay with me on the West Coast for five days, and we set out to write songs not knowing where it would take us,&rdquo; Rostam explains. &ldquo;There was something I&rsquo;d heard in Wes&rsquo; singing in the earliest days ofRaRa Riot that I felt had never been captured on record.&rdquo; Influenced by their shared love of U2&rsquo;s Achtung Baby, the pair spent five days writing the songs &ldquo;Water&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Need Your Light&rdquo;. &ldquo;The attitude of these two songs was only able to come because of over ten years of collaboration,&rdquo; Miles adds. &ldquo;These two songs were written with no expectations, and wequickly realized that we wanted them to be played live.&rdquo; So the duo took another week to record bass, drums, guitar and violin in Los Angeles with the full band.

&ldquo;Working with people we had a history with was comfortable in the sense that it enabled us to continue growing and focus more on the music than relationships,&rdquo; Santos adds. &ldquo; We already trusted everyone.&rdquo; Additionally, the group collaborated with previous drummer Gabriel Duquette on the track &ldquo;Bouncy Castle,&rdquo; and with longtime friend Maury on&ldquo; Absolutely,&rdquo; &ldquo; Call Me Out,&rdquo; and &ldquo; Bad Times,&rdquo;&mdash; further expanding the reoccurring theme onNeed Your Light of a band incorporating their past into the future.

Listening to Need Your Light, it&rsquo;s quickly apparent that the heightened level of experimentation and expansive soundscapes wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the band&rsquo;s synth-heavy approach to 2013&rsquo;s Beta Love. This is clearly evident in the opening track &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; which starts off with a syncopated groove and minimalist instrumentation before gradually building into a triumphant, 90&rsquo;s soul call to arms. Alternately, &ldquo;Bouncy Castle&rdquo; resides on the opposite side of the sonic-spectrum with its carefree neo-soul refrain. Yet both of the songs were created with the group&rsquo;s incendiary live performances in mind. &ldquo;We wanted to make sure all of the songs on this album could be reproduced live because performing has always been our greatest strength and something we felt we got away from with our last record,&rdquo; Miles says. &ldquo;A lot of these songs incorporate the same instrumentation we&rsquo;ve used in the past, but the vibe is somewhere we haven&rsquo;t gone before, which is exciting.&rdquo;

Lyrically, Need Your Light parallels the transitional nature of the members&rsquo; lives as they enter their thirties and begin leaving Brooklyn to start families without abandoning the band that they&rsquo;ve spent their lives cultivating. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a grown-up record, but with our still invariably raucous attitude,&rdquo; Miles explains, adding that this evolution was entirely organic. In other words, the aforementioned &ldquo; Bouncy Castle&rdquo; may revolve around an adolescent&rsquo;s first erection, but it&rsquo;s not merely an attempt at humor. &ldquo;On this album we talk about serious things in kind of a funny context, but it&rsquo;s presented very earnestly,&rdquo; Santos says. &ldquo;We really tried to have that type of balance and dichotomy on all of these songs.&rdquo;

From the carefree, orchestrally tinged vibe of &ldquo;Absolutely&rdquo; to the shimmering falsetto pop of &ldquo;Instant Breakup,&rdquo; Need Your Light sees the band mining their career to come up with songs that transcend categorization. This ability to get back in touch with their roots was only encouraged by their decision todo a short tour of warehouses and basements late last year before they reentered the studio. The experience reminded them of why they began RaRa Riot in the first place. &ldquo;Because we started as a house party band, we never wanted to lose sight of having fun and engaging with the audience through visceral live shows,&rdquo; Santos says.

n the past RaRa Riot have latched onto cerebral concepts like the Singularity or futurism, but with this album they cast a wider net, focusing on everything from sexual relationships to the Challenger explosion. &ldquo; It was fun to write songs about Internet affairs and retain a kind of tech-aspect, but it&rsquo;s much more understated,&rdquo; Miles explains. The stories are conveyed in such a way that it leaves the listener the chance to attach a more personal meaning to each of the 10 tracks. Whether Miles is singing about something fantastic or mundane, there&rsquo;s an enduring energy to the songs onNeed Your Light, which illustrates that in many ways, RaRa Riot are still only getting started.

                                            <br/>
                                            
                                        As a musical breeding ground, Seattle is mistrustful of eager strivers.  Still suffering from a grunge hangover, the city would rather embrace its underachievers than hitch its wagon to the obviously ambitious. So for the past eight years, Hey Marseilles has played by the rules, earned their indie cred the usual way: by touring relentlessly across the US and releasing a pair of albums beloved by fans around the world. But even as they succeeded at their modest goals, the members of Hey Marseilles&mdash;singer Matt Bishop, guitarist Nick Ward, keyboardist Philip Kobernik, violist Sam Anderson, violinist Jacob Anderson&mdash;felt restless.  

With their third album, Hey Marseilles shakes off the past and takes a big, bold step. In all its panoramic grandeur, Hey Marseilles leans into a new, bright future. In its polished production, its narrative arc, its departure from the band&#39;s previous MO, the album is a leap forward. And it finds the humble quintet ready for the risk.   

Two years ago, Hey Marseilles met Anthony Kilhoffer, an A-list, LA-based producer and engineer who&#39;s won Grammys for his work with Kanye West and John Legend. Kilhoffer typically trafficks in the realm of Top-40 pop and hip-hop, among platinum-status megastars like Jay Z and R. Kelly and Rick Ross. After they were introduced by mutual friends, Kilhoffer saw something in Hey Marseilles that he couldn&#39;t resist: the radical adventure of veering down an uncharted road. He jumped at the chance to work with the band. For their part, Hey Marseilles recognized an unprecedented opportunity to push their usual creative in new directions. Up for the challenge, they went all-in.  

In early 2014, the group made a couple trips to LA, prewriting with Kilhoffer and a small cadre of songwriters, absorbing their almost scientific advice on how to hone the more accessible, &quot;pop&quot; elements of their sound. Later that year, Kilhoffer spent a couple weeks in Seattle, taking the helm at the mixing board at Avast and London Bridge Studios while the band completed recording. They found that the 41-year-old producer was&mdash;how to put this delicately?&mdash;eccentric in his approach. (Ask them about it; they have a zillion stories.) In his focus on immediacy and accessibility, they also believed Kilhoffer was right. His MO, as paraphrased by the band: Find the song&#39;s catchiest part. Get there faster. Do it more.  

What you hear on Hey Marseilles is a band has the guts to change course deep into their career, backed by the self-awareness to understand the exact place they were meant to go. It&#39;s self-titled because, at three albums in, the band announcing itself the world as if for the first time. All of the members have individual songwriting credits here&mdash;a first. The entire album, music and lyrics, is about adventurousness, finding faith in a new path.  

The spirit is there from the start: Album opener &quot;Eyes On You&quot; contains the most explosive climax in Hey Marseilles history, and at under three minutes long, it&#39;s the shortest song they&#39;ve ever recorded. Credit Kilhoffer&#39;s skills as producer and head coach: This is the kind of thrilling hit song he&#39;s known for. &quot;West Coast&quot; follows, inspired by endless hours on the road and the new beginnings found there, &quot;the moment everything had changed&quot; as Bishop sings, his tenor buoyed by Kobernik&#39;s elegant piano. &quot;My Heart&quot; percolates with electro-pop enthusiasm, ready to take a spot next to Kilhoffer&#39;s other Top-40 anthems. Reggie Watts, former Seattleite and current music director on Late Night with James Corden, lends uplifting vocals to the yearning, catchy &quot;Perfect OK.&quot; On &quot;Trouble,&quot; Bishop croons one of the album&#39;s most memorable lyrics, penned by Sam Anderson: &quot;What good is love or trust/If you never get in trouble?&quot; Thematically, &quot;Crooked Lines&quot; picks up where the band&#39;s previous album, Lines We Trace, left off. It&#39;s the album&#39;s only moment of hindsight, countered a few songs later with the band&#39;s simmering, scintillating cover of David Bowie&#39;s &quot;Heroes.&quot; The album closes with &quot;Horizon,&quot; its most introspective number. 

&quot;I&#39;m out on the horizon/with the darkness below,&quot; Bishop sings, Anderson&#39;s cello and Kobernik&#39;s keys resonating like a dirge. &quot;I&#39;m out on the horizon/But it seems like I&#39;m close.&quot;  

Closer than close. Hey Marseilles has arrived.

                                        Three years on from their critically acclaimed &ldquo;barbeque&rdquo; record Corsicana Lemonade, White Denim are back with more than just a new album to commemorate. Their sixth record, Stiff - out 25 March 2016 via Downtown/Sony Red - is a return to the Austin quartet&rsquo;s frenetic rock band roots, and is both a jubilant thrill ride and joyous celebration of their past ten years. Heading into the studio with an external producer to oversee a whole album for the first time - and even writing a tune with Cass McCombs (&lsquo;Thank You&rsquo;) - the band teamed up with the legendary Ethan Johns (Paul McCartney, Laura Marling, The Staves) to produce their first truly live record, one teeming with a cool &lsquo;70s undertow, tumultuous riffs and a feverish energy that&rsquo;s resulted in arguably some of their biggest and brawniest songs to date. 

With drummer Joshua Block and guitarist Austin Jenkins now pursuing other production ventures, vocalist/guitarist James Petralli and bassist Steve Terebecki spent a long time reassessing exactly what White Denim meant to them. &ldquo;The big thing for Steve and I was trying to define what made us want to keep going,&rdquo; Petralli explains of the album&rsquo;s early days. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our partnership about? What&rsquo;s cool about this? We learnt a lot making D and Corsicana Lemonade. We wanted to take some of those lessons and apply it back to our original mission statement. We were trying to get back to some of the things that made us excited about the band in the first place.&rdquo;

Opener &lsquo;Had 2 Know (Personal)&rsquo; is the embodiment of that mission statement. Described by Petralli as &ldquo;a reassertion of our initial intent to make songs that satisfy our urge to play fast&rdquo;, it sets the tone brilliantly for the bulk of Stiff, right from its idiosyncratic, Red Krayola-sampling beginning to its huge, golden era chorus. While it remains distinctively White Denim, there&rsquo;s a reinvigoration permeating through its riffs via new guitarist Jonathan Horne and a beefed-up rhythm section thanks to the work of new drummer Jeffrey Olson. Every single high octane turn - from the tremendously fun &lsquo;Ha Ha Ha Ha (Yeah)&rsquo; to the outrageously shredding &lsquo;Holda You (I&rsquo;m Psycho)&rsquo; - sounds like a band re-energised and revitalised, resulting in what Petralli describes as a &ldquo;high heat, high energy, good times record&rdquo;. Having previously sold out Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush Empire and having toured with Tame Impala and Arctic Monkeys, Stiff is full to the brim with songs that sound ready to now lift White Denim to similar heights.

For the most part, Stiff is an album crammed with adrenaline-fuelled sing-alongs that show off the band&rsquo;s staple technical abilities. But it&rsquo;s also one that sees some new shades that they&rsquo;ve developed along the way, too. Citing new wave and the razor-sharp pop punk of Buzzcocks as influences this time round, there&rsquo;s an addictive Elvis Costello circa This Year&rsquo;s Model quality to &lsquo;Real Deal Momma&rsquo;, a tune that highlights the band&rsquo;s love for hummable synthesisers and curious, affecting oddities. Then there&rsquo;s the cow bell calm and backing vocals laden brilliance of &lsquo;I&rsquo;m The One (Big Big Fun)&rsquo;, that along with &lsquo;Take It Easy (Ever After Lasting Love)&rsquo; (a song Petralli says &ldquo;wants to be on a collection of doo wop songs written in 2016&rdquo;) shows a softer and more intricate side to the band while fully emphasising Petralli&rsquo;s vocal excellence. 

Of the artwork - which was created by collagist Eugenia Loli - Petralli says that though they definitely weren&rsquo;t trying to be outlandish, Loli was inspired and worked from the band&rsquo;s previous album covers and videos as a visual template. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s a fleeting visit to a place the band have been before, with the covers of Workout Holiday and D being collages too. Stiff was even originally stylised &lsquo;Stif&rsquo;, which when spelt backwards spells out the title of their second full-length Fits. Then there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mirrored In Reverse&rsquo;, a nod to the Fits track &lsquo;Mirrored And Reverse&rsquo;. &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;re ten!&rdquo; Petralli says in disbelief while explaining all of the record&rsquo;s throwbacks. &ldquo;We did think about naming this record Ten and referencing the Pearl Jam cover!&rdquo;

Recorded with nothing but equipment that Petralli describes as being &ldquo;past a certain point in the &lsquo;70s&rdquo;, he explains that Stiff is an album made &ldquo;entirely the old way&rdquo;. &ldquo;It was tracked live to 16-track tape with very little overdubs,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was very hardcore record making &ndash; traditional in every aspect.&rdquo; Recorded with Ethan Johns in Asheville, North Carolina over a twenty-day period, Petralli and the band had an intense but deeply educational time with Johns. &ldquo;It was really cool. The guy had these stories that were just unbelievable. He started talking about playing with Jimmy Page when he was a kid, and he lived in the studio where The Rolling Stones and The Faces would just hang out. Having Ethan in the room pushing us really made it more of an &lsquo;in the moment&rsquo; and a visual thing. Capturing live performances is what he does really well.&rdquo;

To make things even more celebratory, there was an extra ten day stint spent with go-to White Denim man Jim Vollentine, who Petralli describes as &ldquo;my guy, man&rdquo;. He continues: &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve made a lot of records together now. When we left the studio in Asheville with Ethan, we thought we gotta work on this record some more, you know? Though it was really just mixing, which we did with respect to Ethan&rsquo;s arrangements and his recording. I feel like I really haven&rsquo;t made anything like this before.&rdquo; 

Ultimately, Stiff is the sound of a band finding their feet again and having the time of their lives. It&rsquo;s a record that refuses to buckle under the pressures of life, instead offering up a soundtrack to sing, dance, shout and scream along to. As a White Denim album, it&rsquo;s a joyride through the past ten years of the band&rsquo;s idiosyncratic catalogue while simultaneously pushing things further forward into new territories. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s similar to our first record [Workout Holiday] in that we found the initial energy and just went with that,&rdquo; Petralli says of the initial studio spark that started it all. &ldquo;We thought, what&rsquo;s the fundamental thing that made us want to get into a van and quit our terrible jobs and start this whole thing in the first place? And it was loud, fast-playing, rock and roll.&rdquo;

                                        Bag Raiders&#39; Jack Glass and Chris Stracey are preparing to bring their glittery electro-house pop jams to the USA, with the announcement of a March/April tour that includes a slot at dance music&#39;s mecca - Ultra Music Festival in Miami. The boys have been honing their live show on the Australian summer festival circuit, and are ready to bring some Sunlight to a club near you. Bag Raiders dropped in the US on January 25th, and instantly went Top 10 on the iTunes electronic charts, where it peaked last week at #4. Their album was #2 most added at RPM radio last week, and entered the CMJ RPM most played charts at #32.

&quot;Gigantic, dulce de leche pop that expertly marries tuxedo dance with brazen, hooky vocals. ... Bag Raiders transcends typical dance and pop boundaries, showcasing the creativity of a band at the forefront of modern production. The album will appeal to fans new and old, coming correct with sing-a-long choruses, deep-breath anthems, blissful chill and pure dancefloor energy.&quot; - RCRDLBL

                                        Over the past four years, North-East siblings Peter and David Brewis have threaded their way through one extra-curricular project after another but were inevitably drawn back to working together on theirown songs. &quot;As much fun as we might have had on our own or collaborating, we missed just spending time in the studio, the two of us, trying things out and playing together.&quot; explains David. The space that Field Music vacated in those four years still appears to be empty. No one else really does what Field Music do: the interweaving vocals, the rhythmic gear changes, the slightly off-chords, but with the sensibility that keeps them within touching distance of pop music. But with Commontime, FieldMusic show off their unashamed love of choruses in a way they&#39;ve only hinted at before. Written and recorded in spontaneous bursts over six months in their Wearside studio, Commontime is built around the brothers playing and singing together again, but also features a wider array of players, including original Field Music keyboardist Andrew Moore, Peter&#39;s wife Jennie Brewis and new member of the live band Liz Corney on vocals, plus a panoply of other players. &quot;We wanted to embrace being a duo and, perversely, that made us feel more comfortable about all of those conspicuous cameos&quot; reveals David.  Over the fourteen songs of Commontime, real life conversations are replayed, acquaintances come and go, hard won friendships are left to drift and diffuse snap shots of the everyday are pulled together into what must rank amongst Field Music&#39;s best works to date.

                                        For more than a decade pianist Marco Benevento has been amassing an extensive resume of composition and collaboration. His albums set forth a vision that connects the dots between Explosions In The Sky and Tortoise on one side, Brian Eno and Brad Mehldau on the other. In the live setting, his performances reverberate with pulsating dance rock energy, which has led to high profile appearances, ranging from Carnegie Hall to Celebrate Brooklyn, Newport Jazz to Bonnaroo. Benevento has been invited to open for The Books, Ben Folds and Rubblebucket, while headlining shows from coast to coast.

In 2014, Benevento returned to the studio to record his latest work with producer Richard Swiftwhose resume includes The Shins, Foxygen and Tennis. Together, they focused their attention on a collection of news songs that add Benevento&rsquo;s vocals and lyrics to his lush instrumental piano rock. The collaboration resulted a lo-fi, psychedelic, dance rock gem that shimmers with acoustic piano, synths and analog keyboards. The album, entitled Swift, was released to wide acclaim on Benevento&rsquo;s own label, Royal Potato Family.

As anybody who&#39;s seen Marco Benevento perform can attest, with eyes closed, smile wide across his face and fingers free-flowing across the keys, the pianist is a satellite to the muse. With a devout and growing fan-base, Benevento is an artist whose story is only beginning to unfold.

                                        Cullen Omori knows it&rsquo;s a false cliche to say there are no second acts in American lives, but after the 2014 breakup of his acclaimed band the Smith Westerns, living that cliche was his greatest fear. His solo debut New Misery, out March 18 on Sub Pop Records, is a direct challenge to that anxiety: an album that goes beyond the glam punch of the Smith Westerns to new sounds, new sources of inspiration, and greater self-awareness.

&ldquo;I had this overwhelming feeling that perhaps the apex of my life both as a musician and as an individual would be relegated to five years in my late teens/early 20s,&rdquo; says Omori, who was launched into the music industry when the Smith Westerns, who started in high school in Chicago, became fast-rising indie stars. &ldquo;This fear really forced me to work hard as to not see the Smith Westerns as an end but as a point along a bigger trajectory.&rdquo;

While New Misery grew out of a difficult personal and professional time for Omori, he says the title reflects &ldquo;not so much the distress that comes with failure, but the troubles and complexities that come with any type of success. No matter what you get you&#39;re going to want more, you&#39;re going to want something different. That&rsquo;s the catch.&rdquo;

The title track is a dreamy, resonant reflection on these feelings, but is also a guidepost for Omori&rsquo;s musical evolution. &ldquo;The song starts slow and then builds with two solos,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&#39;s the guitar solo which is very much a Smith Westerns thing. The next solo is on the keyboard, which is a shift to a lot of what I&rsquo;m trying to do.&rdquo; Synths play a much larger role in Omori&rsquo;s new music than in the Smith Westerns&rsquo; guitar-fueled rock, as do a wide range of influences including Roxy Music, INXS, Spiritualized, Wilco, Garbage, Hall &amp; Oates, Kate Bush, U2, and Sparks. There&rsquo;s also a more deliberate pop streak, inspired by the top-40 radio that would play while Omori worked at a medical supply company cleaning stretchers and wheelchairs. 

&ldquo;There is so much dirt in hospitals and fuzz and lint and dried blood on these things. We&rsquo;d clean them down, which in a way is kind of therapeutic, and listen to the radio. Then we&#39;d go back to Adam&#39;s (Adam Gil, current live band member) house and record demos for what was to become the skeleton of New Misery. I can&rsquo;t  sit down and say I&#39;m going to write a Sam Smith or an Adele song or whatever. The closest I can get to that is making like this weird hybrid of what I think is a pop song.&rdquo; The strongest example of this is the new wave-tinged single &ldquo;Cinnamon,&rdquo; which Omori describes as &ldquo;dark pop--it&#39;s poppy, it&#39;s fast, but it also has all the colors and tones that are kind of dark. It&rsquo;s self-deprecating, which was kind of where I was at emotionally. That, you know, I could have this poppy song or whatever but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a pop star. I&#39;m closer to thinking I&#39;m a piece of shit than I am a pop star.&rdquo;

Along with Omori, New Misery features additional bass and keyboards from Ryan Mattos, drums from Loren Humphrey, and James Richardson on guitar. But unlike with the more distributed roles within the Smith Westerns, Omori wrote, played, and oversaw nearly every part of the new album, beginning a true new chapter of his long-term creative growth. 

&ldquo;People would be like, &lsquo;Oh man, your band is doing really well. I saw you on the internet.&rsquo; But seeing you on the internet isn&#39;t equivalent with making hundreds let alone thousands of dollars or being really successful. When I was younger I believed that happiness came from success and now that I&rsquo;m older, more seasoned I find myself believing that stability over a long time is also its own type of success. I came out of Smith Westerns at 25 with no real job experience, I only knew how to play music. Writing and recording these songs for myself was cathartic, and I didn&rsquo;t know my destination or future, but picking up my guitar and playing was the only way I knew I&rsquo;d get close to figuring it out.&rdquo;

                                            <br/>
                                            
                                        After hearing her lithe, fairytale-reminiscent songs, perhaps it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise you to learn that AURORA (born Aurora Aksnes) hails from a Norwegian city with a name translates to &ldquo;Fjord of Lights.&rdquo; Or that when she was six, the future singer/songwriter was disciplined for convincing classmates that their school was overrun with talking mice. Or even that her first brush with making music was discovering a toy piano, and she managed to keep her hobby a secret from her parents until well into her teen years. 

Now nineteen and on the cusp of releasing her debut full-length, All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend, AURORA&rsquo;s fantasies have only grown, inhabiting every corner of her music. A girl makes peace with her murderer and the inherit vulnerability of life in the haunting piano ballad &ldquo;Murder Song (5,4,3,2,1).&rdquo; A runaway fades away into the wonder of nature over the course of &ldquo;Runaway,&rdquo; her escape marked with harpsichord, live percussion, and an undeniable sense of wonder. And coupled with an anthemic swell of synths and AURORA&rsquo;s triumphant vocal, &ldquo;Running With the Wolves&rdquo; makes tapping into one&rsquo;s lupine side seem not only plausible but downright irresistible.    

&ldquo;When I was very young, younger than now, I could listen to songs by Cohen and Bob Dylan, not even knowing the English language yet, and still kind of understand what the song was about, and have a sense of emotion from the song without knowing the words,&rdquo; AURORA reveals. &ldquo;I always strive to be better and I always feel like everything I&rsquo;m making can be better if I had more time. I&rsquo;m very picky. But the most important thing is the emotion in the song, of course. So I hope that the emotions in my songs are clear enough that you don&rsquo;t need to know what the words mean.&rdquo;

Nowhere is that idea of overflowing visceral content more evident than her new single &ldquo;Conqueror,&rdquo; where, against a percussive wave, she sings of someone longing to be rescued from &ldquo;Broken mornings/broken nights/broken days in between.&rdquo; Written for fun one night in the studio with her bandmates (who she refers to as her &ldquo;second family&rdquo;) AURORA calls the anthem a personal reminder&mdash;in addition to being one of the most fun songs in her catalogue to perform live. 

&ldquo;I know that I&rsquo;m very sensitive,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;In many ways I&rsquo;m weak. But if you&rsquo;re weak, you&rsquo;re also very strong. Because you need to work a bit harder to survive as well&hellip;You have to find the conqueror in yourself at first, I think. That&rsquo;s what I think about in the song. It&rsquo;s just a person who hasn&rsquo;t realized that yet. That person is still trying to find the conqueror in someone else. You have to find the conqueror in yourself to land on your own feet. You are the only one you need to survive. Then other people will make your life a good life as well. It&rsquo;s important to be strong in yourself.&rdquo; 

However AURORA prefers to swap weakness and sorrow for happiness, punctuating even the heaviest of topics with laughs and thoughtful tangents. Even her album title, a metaphor for making peace with your past, hints at a chance for not only redemption, but also joy amidst the darkness.  

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to write sad songs only to make people sad,&rdquo; she notes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll end up with lots of depressed fans.&rdquo; 

At that admission AURORA pauses, giggling as she admits she&rsquo;s crying as she speaks, a byproduct of just reflecting on all the support she&rsquo;s received so far. 

&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my goal at all,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;But I want to people to know that it&rsquo;s not dangerous to cry or think of something sad for a while. It&rsquo;s easier to think about it through a song, which can also be beautiful while being sad. It&rsquo;s like taking medicine with a teaspoon of sugar. It&rsquo;s important to have some hope.&rdquo;

                                        All signs point to The Wild Feathers becoming the next great American rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll band. The Nashville-based group&mdash;Ricky Young [guitar, vocals], Taylor Burns [guitar, vocals], Joel King [bass, vocals], Preston Wimberly [guitar, vocals], and Ben Dumas [drums]&mdash;spent more than two years on the road supporting their 2013 self-titled full-length album alongside everybody from Bob Dylan to Gary Clark Jr. The record hit #1 on Billboard&rsquo;s Heatseekers Chart, and they received invites to appear on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O Brien, Seth Meyers, Craig Ferguson, ABC&rsquo;s Nashville, and more. Unanimous critical praise arrived courtesy of Rolling Stone, New York Times, Huffington Post, USA Today, and countless others. Along the way, evolution stayed on their minds as they started writing songs for what would become their 2016 sophomore effort, Lonely Is A Lifetime [Warner Bros. Records].

Lonely Is a Lifetime reflects a richer confluence of influences, while maintaining their signature soul and spirit and a nod to all that time on the road together. They&rsquo;ve grown as men and musicians, and they&rsquo;re ready to claim their spot in the canon of American rock music.

                                        If Shakespeare was alive to get the Led out, he would&#39;ve listened to Diarrhea Planet, Nashville&#39;s favorite six-piece rock and roll band. Outfitted with a drummer and bassist that barrel forth with the power of a thousand locomotives and a four guitar arsenal able to unleash a meticulous torrent of expertly crafted hooks, riffs and solos, DP take everything you knew you loved about rock, punk and pop, jack it up way past 11, and leave you catching your breath and massaging the kink in your neck from all that head banging. Over the past few years, Diarrhea Planet have packed basements, bars and clubs with enough power to cause a blackout at the Super Bowl (no one said they were not responsible for this year&#39;s fiasco), honing their chops and fine-tuning their shred.

Diarrhea Planet&#39;s 2011 debut Loose Jewels (Infinity Cat) was a 100-meter sprint of pure joy, peppered with shred offs, fret-taps and a whole lot of whooping and hollering, fleshed out by undeniable pop sensibilities. For their next album, the band wanted to go as big as possible and delivered just that. They headed to Marcata Recordings, the barn-turned-studio in upstate New York owned and operated by Kevin S. McMahon, famed indie producer of records by Titus Andronicus, Swans, The Walkmen, Real Estate, and many others. I&#39;m Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams (Infinity Cat, 2013) traipses giddily across the rock and roll spectrum due to the band&#39;s ever-expanding understanding of how to maximize its four guitarists to orchestral effect. It is glorious, unabashedly fun, and bolstered by a musical and emotional maturity that reveals itself in the increasing complexity of the arrangements, musicianship, and lyrics.

On the road, the band showed what they were truly made of, unleashing power stance tableaus, onstage theatrics and six-string tricks, while still hitting every necessary note with pristine precision. They&rsquo;ve shared stages and tours with JEFF The Brotherhood, Fucked Up, The Men, Wavves, Screaming Females and Titus Andronicus, who even gave a shout out to Diarrhea Planet on their last full-length Local Business. NPR called their live show &ldquo;an unstoppable train of life-affirming shredding,&rdquo; while Pitchfork said &ldquo;If you measure a live show&rsquo;s success by how happy to be alive it makes you, then Nashville&rsquo;s Diarrhea Planet have the greatest live show on Earth.&rdquo;

Despite touring non-stop for a year and a half, Diarrhea Planet found time to get in the studio and record five new songs. Their EP Aliens In The Outfield &mdash; recorded by Justin Francis (Anti-Flag, Mac DeMarco, Kenny Rogers) and mixed by Grammy award-winning engineer Vance Powell (Jack White, PUJOL, Beck) &mdash; dropped in 2014 to critical acclaim. Paste Magazine named it the #1 EP of 2014, saying &ldquo;If Aliens in the Outfield serves as any indication, Diarrhea Planet should continue to melt faces while still infusing subtle lyricism into their shredding three-minute jams.&rdquo; 

With the release of Aliens, a sprawling spring and summer tour, and a new album on the horizon, Diarrhea Planet are ready to keep conquering hearts, demolishing ear drums, and reminding you that while rock and roll has never needed saving, it is damn good to have a band that makes it as wholly lifeaffirming and flat out fun as it&#39;s supposed to be.

                                        Dame Fortune is the deliciously eclectic sixth album from veteran producer and crate digger extraordinaire RJD2, out March 25th on RJ&rsquo;s Electrical Connections. It&rsquo;s a wondrous beast, recorded over the past year while living in Philadelphia, before returning to his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. Streaked with Philly&#39;s rep for deeply felt soul music while maintaining a playful sense of adventurousness, Dame Fortune features guest vocalists Son Little (aka Aaron Livingston) and frequent collaborator Phonte, while also presenting the bombastic hip-hop sound that marked RJD2&#39;s breakthrough album, Deadringer, and even an orchestral composition for the societal unrest experienced in this day and age (called &ldquo;PF Day One&rdquo;&hellip;the PF standing for &quot;Post Ferguson&quot;). 

&ldquo;Living in Philly provided a context for a lot of soul music that I had liked,&quot; RJD2 says on the city&#39;s influence on Dame Fortune&#39;s sound. &quot;I didn&#39;t have any cultural context for this music that I liked&mdash;it was just music that I had stumbled across as a beat making nerd. Philly was a place where there were enough people who had the same musical vocabulary that I did, which made the music more than something I had just discovered on my own.&quot; 

Listen below to debut single, &ldquo;Peace of What,&rdquo; which features Jordan Brown and draws inspiration from 1990s rap legends Main Source&rsquo;s 1991 single &quot;Peace Is Not the Word to Play.&quot; &quot;When I hear people talk of peace in America, the discrepancy between our words and our actions can get fatiguing,&quot; he says on the inspiration behind the song. &quot;I was trying to reflect the experience of people I know, which often feels like &lsquo;We&#39;re not ACTUALLY trying to do anything about this problem in our country.&rsquo;&quot; 

Thought-provoking and undeniably entertaining all at once, this latest exhibition of musical virtuosity is a crystal-clear reflection of RJD2&#39;s cinematic aspirations, reminding listeners that it&#39;s always rewarding to expect the unexpected. RJD2 will tour throughout 2016 in support of Dame Fortune and his 20-year-plus career.

                                        DMA&#39;S is the musical project of Johnny Took, Matt Mason &amp; Tommy O&#39;Dell -- three best friends from Newtown, Australia. 

Having cut their teeth playing with a number of different bands in Sydney&#39;s inner west over the years, the trio began writing and recording demos in Johnny&#39;s bedroom around 2 years ago. Set on taking their time to hone their craft and sound, the three friends soon found themselves with a library of nearly 40 demos. 

Finally content with the identity that the songs had taken, DMA&#39;S released their debut single in February this year in the form of a track simply titled &#39;Delete&#39; (along with a short film by director Mitchell Grant that was filmed in Johnny&#39;s bedroom -- the same location that the band recorded and produced the track) and despite having never played a show under this moniker, the reaction was instantly overwhelming as critics and fans alike proceeded to jump on board -- including Dave Rowntree of Blur (who awarded them his record of the week on XFM, comparing them to Arctic Monkeys &amp; Oasis), Triple J and NME Magazine. 

It would seem that word continued to quickly spread around their hometown of Sydney -- illustrated by the band&#39;s first show drawing over 450 punters and leaving another 100 or so unable to get in! From that point DMA&#39;S have hit the touring circuit of Australia, selling out multiple rooms around the country and getting the call up to played the respected Splendour in the Grass Festival -- sharing the stage with acts such as Interpol and Future Islands. 

Now DMA&#39;S are set to head overseas with their next release, a double A-side 7&quot; single, &#39;Laced&#39; / &#39;So We Know&#39; that will be released through I OH YOU in Australia, and internationally via tastemakers labels Mermaid Avenue (US) / Partisan Records (UK). 

&quot;This has the swagger of Oasis and the musicality and inventiveness of Arctic Monkeys.&quot; - Dave Rowntree 

&quot;Terminally infectious...just remember, when you&#39;re arm in arm with your friends, in a big pile of mud, howling at the top of your lungs... you heard it here first&quot; - Channel V 

&quot;The three Sydney friends have curated a feeling of nostalgic bliss...&quot; - Indie Shuffle

                                        It&#39;s hard to think of anything more starkly reliable than the ticking of a clock, but time is an untrustworthy thing. It feels like ages since we&#39;ve had a proper Pete Yorn LP to dissect, though it&#39;s been just five years. And it seems like only yesterday that we first heard musicforthemorningafter, which came out back in 2001. Yorn&#39;s brand new album and Capitol Records debut, ArrangingTime, plays with the elasticity of the years both in between and since &mdash; it&#39;s not only a culmination of the Los Angeles by way of New Jersey artist&#39;s adventurous latter-day projects, but a return to his original leaner methods. 

For the first time since 2003&#39;s Day I Forgot, producer R. Walt Vincent returns to help Yorn execute his most poised and diverse set of songs yet. ArrangingTime runs the gamut from elegiac folk to wasteland blues to upbeat, synth-kissed rock. Of course, some things never change. Yorn still plays the observer, stepping into characters &mdash; or his past selves from previous years &mdash; routing wistful poems and beatific visions through the weather-beaten voice of a man who&#39;s seen a few things in his time. 

&quot;I&#39;ll look at pictures of places I went, or things I did,&quot; says Yorn, &quot;and I think, &#39;Look at how great that day was and you just missed it.&#39; I think about the past and how much of it is a blur. The title of the album is a reminder to be present and within each song is a minor lesson about that. Time only gets faster as you get older.&quot;

We blinked and Yorn turned 40, but he isn&#39;t settling or slowing. If the extra-musical side of his last few years has been about anything, it is hard work. He&#39;s focused on personal growth, broken bad habits, learned to get out of his own way, and become more lithe to life&#39;s undulations. He got married. He gave the commencement address at alma mater Syracuse University (his speech was about running toward the stuff that makes you uncomfortable in life). And last year, after completing an acoustic tour without a backing band or a set list, he welcomed a child into this world. 

&quot;I was taking my life back,&quot; says Yorn. &quot;It was back-to-back with the records, and I toured a lot. There used to be just one way to approach the road in my mind: fucking burn it out. I had to realize, &#39;Maybe I&#39;m addicted to some things, and a little scared of adulthood.&#39; I said, &#39;I want to tackle this.&#39; Now, discipline feels better than excess.&quot; 

As he prepares to release another album, it&#39;s clear his music has been shored up too. By one measure, another trick of time, Yorn&#39;s first three albums span a single day. The so-called &quot;trilogy&quot; &mdash; musicforthemorningafter, Day I Forgot, and Nightcrawler (2006) &mdash; captures the man&#39;s progression from an unknown songwriter unspooling raw magic at the storied Caf&eacute; Largo, to the sort of dude who can dial up Dave Grohl for a ripping drum solo and trade twanged verses with Natalie Maines. Those all found Yorn solo with a producer, building songs in the studio (or garage). 

But for his last two, 2009&#39;s Back &amp; Fourth and 2010&#39;s Pete Yorn, he did the session thing, stepping into readymade bands under the guidance of Saddle Creek producer Mike Mogis and Pixies genius Frank Black, respectively. And those were bookended by collaborative projects: 2009&#39;s playful album-length duet with Scarlett Johansson, Break Up, and The Olms (2013), a sunny, &#39;60s-styled retro-pop duo with J.D. King.

&quot;I went on a run abandoning my first approach,&quot; says Yorn. &quot;I was molting an old skin in a lot of ways. After that, it felt natural to come back to just letting it flow with Walt. I have no illusions: You can&#39;t walk through the same river twice. I&#39;m not trying to recreate an album I made in my 20s. I&#39;m revisiting a method. I started off doing watercolors, then I did sculpting. And now I&#39;m back on watercolors.&quot;

But he does bring his experience with him to the looser style of his first producer, R. Walt Vincent (with work from a couple of others). ArrangingTime opener &quot;Summer Was a Day&quot; drops us into the desert at night &mdash; it&#39;s lush with shimmering ambience, swelling strings, ringing guitar strum and skittering beats. And while &quot;In Your Head&quot; juxtaposes Springsteen&#39;s heartland chug with Morrissey&#39;s dramatic softness, a song like &quot;Shopping Mall&quot; is just understated and pretty &mdash; spare on instrumentation and generous with emotion. Penultimate track &quot;Tomorrow&quot; is almost a dance cut, and Yorn&#39;s attempt to buck the singer-songwriter trend of the album-ending slow fade.

ArrangingTime flows like a mixtape with Yorn&#39;s warm voice and perspective as the through-line. These 12 songs are populated by fragmented folks: people waiting for something to happen (the bus-stop sitter in the dreamy &quot;Halifax&quot;), or chasing a feeling they once had (the angsty burnout in the raucous &quot;Screaming at the Setting Sun&quot;). But it&#39;s not all so bleak &mdash; light seeps through the cracks in &quot;I&#39;m Not the One,&quot; where our host morphs into a loner coming to terms with his self-imposed isolation. 

&quot;I&#39;m an observer,&quot; says Yorn. &quot;I&#39;m into subtleties, the moments between moments, but I don&#39;t pretend to know where all the ideas come from. I try to clear myself, create a melody and let that emotion dictate what comes out. I like my own songs when I haven&#39;t even figured them out yet. I&#39;m into the mysterious part of the process.&quot;

But we&#39;re still allowed to guess at the hidden lessons of ArrangingTime. In the case of the characters above, one&#39;s stuck on the future, one&#39;s trapped in the past, and the other&#39;s learning to be present. The ambling &quot;Walking Up&quot; acknowledges outcomes both negative and positive as neutral &mdash; the titular act is what&#39;s important: facing the challenge, eyes open, in the moment. Because as seemingly treacherous as that tick-tock, tick-tock can be, it&#39;s not time that&#39;s changeable. It&#39;s the timekeeper.

                                        Melody&#39;s Echo Chamber is the solo project of Paris-based songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Melody Prochet. The first MEC album, produced by Tame Impala&#39;s Kevin Parker, was released in 2012 to critical acclaim for its lush psychedelia and adventurous spirit by Les Inrocks, Vogue, Rolling Stone, and Pitchfork. Prochet cited influences as diverse as Erik Satie, Can, and Stereolab for the record&#39;s sound. MEC toured extensively in support of the album in 2012-13, with high-profile festival slots at Montreux Jazz Festival, Primavera Sound, and Glastonbury. In October of 2014, Prochet released new single &quot;Shirim&quot; on her own label Rayon Vert. NME praised the song for being &quot;celestial and authoritative, but also wonderfully unhinged,&quot; and NPR called the track &quot;sweet, psychedelic, and magical.&quot; The second album by Melody&#39;s Echo Chamber will be released in the summer of 2016.

                                        Welcome to the rue Kato. Welcome to Kinshasa. Welcome to System &#39;K&#39;.

There was a time when Africa&#39;s third most populated city was number one in musical terms. The whole continent danced to its premium musical exports: rumba and soukous. Then war, corruption and chaos bought Kinshasa to its knees and its population fell back on what the French wittily refer to as Syst&egrave;me D, after the French words se d&eacute;brouiller and se d&eacute;merder. Roughly defined, Syst&egrave;me D means to cope, get by and hack out a living at the coalface of poverty with only your wits to guide you and your courage to protect you.

But Kinshasa, an immense agglomeration of shanty-villages with their disparate maze of peoples, languages and cultures, has never gone in for self-pity that much; it&#39;s too busy staying alive and being obtuse. Away from the gaze of the world, its artists, musicians and creators are cooking up their own revolt against the grotesque pantomime of life in 21st century Congo. Necessity, ingenuity and an innate sense of style are conspiring together to make &quot;magic out of garbage&quot;, to quote producer Doctor L. It&#39;s a new spirit, concocted from the waste of consumerism in one of the most abused and rejected places on earth, with its epicentre in the rue Kato, a two kilometre long drag that slices through the pretence of Kinshasa&#39;s downtown commercial district. If that spirit were in need of slogans then &quot;Screw your Pity!&quot; and &quot;Dream or Die!&quot; might serve well.

Yakala &#39;Coco&#39; Ngambali and Nsituvuidi &#39;Theo&#39; Nzonza, know all about Syst&egrave;me D. They&#39;ve been living it for fifty years and more, down by the Congo river docks, out in the combustible atmosphere of Kinshasa&#39;s streets, in night shelters, on roundabouts, with the other &#39;cripples&#39; and rejects, polio victims and sh&eacute;gu&eacute;s or street kids. Their love of Congolese rumba and its pantheon of demi-Gods -Franco, Tabu Ley Rochereau, Pepe Kall&eacute; - provided the early impulse to learn the guitar and play music. About fifteen years ago, they formed a band with other street hustlers, both handicapped and able-bodied, and named it after a local beer joint. Staff Benda Bilili - &quot;the people who see beyond&quot; - became an unimagined worldwide hit. Kinshasa specialises in producing the nimagined.

After releasing two albums, starring in the acclaimed film Benda Bilili and touring the world, Coco and Theo left the band in 2013. The split was testing and uncomfortable, but they saw no reason to shed any tears or dwell on it. Within months Coco had begun composing songs (he was the main composer in Staff Benda Bilili) and gathering musicians for a new project: Mbongwana Star. &quot;Staff Benda Bilili? That&#39;s the past,&quot; says Coco. &quot;I concentrate on the present.&quot;

Coco and Th&eacute;o knew that they had to look beyond the rumba funk of Staff Benda Bilili and find a new direction, a USP, a sound that faithfully mirrored the creative genius of their home city. One day the filmmaker Renaud Barret (half of the team that gave us Benda Bilili, Jupiter&#39;s Dance and other seminal documentaries about Kinshasa) played Coco and Theo an album called Black Voices, by the Nigerian drummer Tony Allen. It was produced by Liam Farrell, aka Doctor L, the son of an Irish painter who grew up in Paris and became involved in the Parisian hip hop and electro scenes before applying his maverick aesthetic to African music. &quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; was Theo&#39;s reaction. &quot;That&#39;s the direction we should go in. Because mbongwana means &#39;change&#39;. Because that&#39;s the future.&quot;

The first recording sessions with Doctor L took place in a hired yard in downtown Kinshasa, with a chugging generator pumping out the electricity that the perfidious politicians of the DRC were incapable of providing themselves. Everyone admits that initial proceedings were fairly shambolic, with friends and relatives piling in to swell the numbers and music gushing forth with joyful but unfocused energy. When Doctor L took the masters back to Paris the alchemy began: rhythms were laid bare, voices honed, guitars given a new sonic garb. The result was revolutionary.

&quot;I wanted to change the classical pre-conceptions about African music,&quot; Farrell says. &quot;Kinshasa reminds me of New York in the 1980s...a place where you could have a punk band, a gay band, a new wave band...what the fuck! Like everywhere else, Africa deserves to have artists who can choose whether they&#39;re related 100% to Africa or not. We&#39;re not talking about Africa, or wheel chairs, we&#39;re talking about guys who are doing music.&quot;

When Coco and Th&eacute;o heard the demos, it was a shock, but a happy one. &quot;In the beginning it was a bit hard,&quot; Coco says, &quot;But then we really understood. We work well with Liam, he&#39;s a real artist. And he&#39;s courageous!&quot; Renaud Barrett remembers that the new sound was received in Kinshasa with wild dancing and escalating excitement.

World Circuit&#39;s Nick Gold heard the demos and immediately signed the band to the label. Farrell and manager Michel Winter returned to Kinshasa in late 2014. By then Mbongwana Star had made the new sound their own: &quot;That&#39;s what I love about Africa,&quot; Farrell says, &quot;the strength and rapidity by which they can integrate whatever comes up.&quot; The group had been honed down to Coco and Th&eacute;o on main vocals, Jean-Claude Kamina Mulodi aka &#39;R9&#39; (so called because he was the ninth child in his family) on guitar, a young street-kid called Makana Kalambayi aka &#39;Randy&#39; who&#39;d been Coco&#39;s wheel-
chair pusher and part-time member of Staff Benda Bilili on percussion and drums and Coco&#39;s step-son Sage on vocals and general vibe-mastery.

And Liam Farrell on bass and effects. That&#39;s the point. This isn&#39;t an African band per se. It&#39;s a trans-global barrier-busting sound machine that demands the unfettered horizons of any artist who values originality and creativity, wherever in the world he or she might live.

&quot;We wanted to try and get out of the Afro-African straightjacket into which everyone tries to put African bands,&quot; says Michel Winter, &quot;We wanted to get back in spirit, if not music, to 1970s when Africans were really modern, maybe more than us. There&#39;s a lot more creativity there than we can imagine. Kinshasa is crawling with creativity.&quot;

Mbongwana Star&#39;s first video &#39;Malukayi (feat. Konono No.1)&#39; was shot by Renaud Barret and directed by Barret and Farrell. It features a character called The Congo Astronaut, a 100% pure ghetto boy who has decided that his life will, for the time being, consist of dressing up in a space suit and wandering the streets of Kinshasa. The Congo Astronaut is just one phenomenon to have come out of the rue Kato, where the city&#39;s garbage-to-art revolution is in full spate. It&#39;s not just about music; artists, sculptors, stylists, photographers, jewellery designers, self-made engineers and technicians, all of them are at work in rue Kato, or the nearby Academie des Beaux-Arts, refashioning waste into unimagined objects, sounds, happenings, ideas. Minimalism, style and raw urban energy hangs heavy in the air, like tropical moisture. &quot;Here we&#39;d call it &#39;hacking&#39; or &#39;up-cycling&#39; or whatever,&quot; Barret says. &quot;There, it&#39;s just necessity.&quot;

Barret set up a giant screen at the Beaux Arts in Kinshasa to premier to the &#39;Malukayi&#39; video. The whole academy was there to watch it. The response was fervent: &quot;That&#39;s it! That&#39;s us!&quot;

System D is becoming System K, a revolution that won&#39;t be televised, not for a while at least. But you&#39;d be fool to miss it.

                                        When Jack Tatum began work on Life of Pause, his third full-length to date, he had lofty ambitions: Don&#39;t just write another album; create another world. One with enough detail and texture and dimension that a listener could step inside, explore, and inhabit it as they see fit. &quot;I desperately wanted for this to be the kind of record that would displace me,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;m terrified by the idea of being any one thing, or being of any one genre. And whether or not I accomplish that, I know that my only hope of getting there is to constantly reinvent. That reinvention doesn&#39;t need to be drastic, but every new record has to have its own identity, and it has to have a separate set of goals from what came before.&quot;

What came before: a rightfully acclaimed, much beloved display of singular pop craftsmanship. Tatum&#39;s dreamy, unexpected 2010 debut, Gemini, was written while he was still a student at Virginia Tech University. Its equally disarming follow-up, 2012&#39;s Nocturne, marked the first time he&#39;d been able to bring his bedroom recordings into a studio, to be performed and fully realized with the help of other musicians. There has been a set of wonderfully expansive EPs in between&mdash;each hinting at new directions and punctuating previous ideas&mdash;but with Life of Pause, Tatum delivers what he describes as his most &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;mature&quot; work yet, an exquisitely arranged and beautifully recorded collection of songs that marry the immediate with the indefinable. &quot;I allowed myself to go down every route I could imagine even if it ended up not working for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I owe it to myself to take as many risks as possible. Songs are songs and you have to allow yourself to be open to everything.&quot;

After a prolonged period of writing and experimentation, recording took place over several weeks in both Los Angeles and Stockholm, with producer Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, Beachwood Sparks) helping Tatum in his search for a more natural and organically textured sound. In Sweden, in a studio once owned by ABBA, they enlisted Peter, Bjorn and John drummer John Ericsson and fellow Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra veteran TK, to contribute drums and marimba. In California, at Monahan&#39;s home, Tatum collaborated with Medicine guitarist Brad Laner and a crew of saxophonists. From the hypnotic polyrhythms of &quot;Reichpop&quot; to the sugary howl of &quot;Japanese Alice&quot; to the hallucinogenic R&amp;B of &quot;A Woman&#39;s Wisdom, the result is a complete, fully immersive listening environment. &quot;I just kept things really simple, writing as ideas came to me,&quot; he says. &quot;There&#39;s definitely a different kind of &#39;self&#39; in the picture this time around. There&#39;s no real love lost, it&#39;s much more a record of coming to terms and defining what it is that you have&mdash;your place, your relationships. I view every record as an opportunity to write better songs. At the end of the day it still sounds like me, just new.&quot;

                                        After a &#39;brief&#39; 25 hour delay in Morocco on his way from Niger, Bombino arrived in 
Woodstock, New York to record his new album at Applehead Studio with Dave 
Longstreth (Dirty Projectors). Applehead is a beautiful studio in a converted barn on 
farmland where goats, pigs, and other animals roam freely. The band stayed in a guest 
house a few steps away from the studio, and took turns making meals. Apart from a 
morning invasion of the guesthouse by a 700-pound pig, Applehead was the perfect 
atmosphere for Bombino and his group to create new music over the course of the 10 
days they had there. Longstreth, meanwhile, proved to be a fantastic match for 
Bombino as this album&rsquo;s producer. He has a deep respect for the Saharan music 
tradition and guided their sessions with a gentle but skilled hand. 

Fans of Bombino and Tuareg music in general will notice a few remarkable innovations 
on this album. The first is the introduction of a new style Bombino is pioneering that he 
affectionally calls &#39;Tuareggae&#39; - a sunny blend of Tuareg blues/rock with reggae 
one-drop and bounce.  Another is the first-ever use of Western vocal harmonies in recorded Tuareg music, (due to Longstreth&#39;s influence) which give the songs new depth  and color.  Finally, the band behind him is tighter and more energetic than ever before. 
The result is Bombino&#39;s best, most well-rounded, and groundbreaking album to date: Azel
.   
The word &quot;Azel&quot; has three meanings in Bombino&#39;s native Tamasheq language - first, it 
is the name of a small desert town just a few kilometers from where he grew up, in 
Agadez, Niger.  His wife&#39;s family is from Azel, and it is the site of the first and only 
Tuareg school in the country.  Bombino has long held aspirations of developing a 
Tuareg community center and arts school in Agadez, so the town of Azel holds a 
special place in his heart. Second, the word azel means the roots or stems of a tree. 
This album is a reflection of Bombino&#39;s unique place in Tuareg music where he at once 
honors the traditional roots of the music while also taking it into brand new territory, 
hence the roots and the stems.  Finally, the word azel is also slang in Tamasheq, 
loosely the equivalent of &#39;That&#39;s my jam!&#39; in American English. The significance of that 
meaning should be instantly obvious to anyone who listens to this album.

                                        From headlining music festivals to teaching some of the biggest yoga classes in the world, MC YOGI is widely becoming known as yoga&#39;s modern day ambassador to the West. &quot;We want to make sure that we&#39;re not skimming the surface. As yoga evolves in America it&#39;s really our responsibility to dig down and discover where it comes from, how it relates to us, and how we can really move it forward so that it can benefit humanity...&quot; MC YOGI&#39;s music is inspired from India&#39;s great epic myths, poems, and sacred texts such as the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. He&#39;s inspired by the life of Mahatma Ghandi and his message of peace. However, with three #1 World albums and hundreds of appearances each year, MC YOGI&#39;s beat-happy, Krishna-crazed music is moving from the yoga community to large, mainstream audiences.

                                        Whilst making their fourth album, The Heavy went through some dark times. There was divorce, near break-ups and the hurdles of everyday life. It all feeds into the Bath quartet&rsquo;s most exhilarating record yet. &ldquo;We attack all of these things,&rdquo; says frontman Kelvin Swaby, &ldquo;and the only way we know how to do that is by writing incredible music.&rdquo; Hurt &amp; The Merciless is the sound of a thrilling rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll band fighting back. 

Swaby, guitarist Dan Taylor, bassist Spencer Page and drummer Chris Ellul wanted the album to capture the powerful blasts of their live show. That life-affirming spark of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll when anything feels possible is the feeling that sums up The Heavy&rsquo;s new record. &ldquo;You realise it&rsquo;s worth trying to capture that human energy in the room rather than trying to generate it after-the-fact on a computer,&rdquo; says Taylor. Their big breakthrough track How You Like Me Now? is a prime example of The Heavy&rsquo;s ethos to date: a swaggering groove built around a sample from a song they cherish. But after a decade spent on the road watching tracks become muscular versions of their recorded counterparts, they were determined to harness their live power in the studio. &ldquo;It was about trying to capture it at the source,&rdquo; says Taylor. 

The Heavy formed in the mid-00s. Taylor and Swaby clicked straight away when they met working in the Bath branch of Gap. Swaby, an old-school crate-digger, noticed Taylor had a copy of The Face magazine and the two started talking about music. They found they had some common influences and began introducing one another to the stuff neither had heard. Taylor was from a classic rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll background and was enthralled by being introduced to the world of hip-hop and sampling. A guitarist who had been in bands growing up, all Taylor ever wanted was to work with someone who had a brilliant voice. When he heard Swaby sing for the first time &ndash; possibly whilst both were slightly inebriated in a club &ndash; he knew he&rsquo;d found his man. &ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;he can sing!&rsquo; It sounded real and authentic.&rdquo;    

As soon as the pair heard what happened when they combined Taylor&rsquo;s dirty riffs with Swaby&rsquo;s soulful voice, they sensed they were onto something. &ldquo;We knew that was our sound and something we could develop,&rdquo; says Swaby. After attracting frenzied crowds to their Open Mic sessions &ndash; they would put up posters around Bath advertising themselves as The World&rsquo;s Fattest Twins and The World&rsquo;s Heaviest Bastards - they realised they needed a proper band (and a proper name) and Ellul and Page were recruited. &ldquo;As soon as you put the four of us in a room, it made so much sense it was gonna work,&rdquo; says Swaby.  

The relationship between Taylor and Swaby is the key to understanding what makes The Heavy tick. It&rsquo;s a classic songwriting partnership: the self-assured, confident frontman taking it all in his stride and the deep-thinking, analytical guitarist. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about practicing. I just do it, it&rsquo;s within us,&rdquo; says Swaby. &ldquo;I take it all seriously. There&rsquo;s a pressure I put on myself. It has to be really fucking good otherwise what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; adds Taylor.

If Hurt &amp; The Merciless marks a musical culmination for the quartet, a mesmeric blend of their trademark rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll classicism and funk and soul grooves with added sonic experimentation, it&rsquo;s also a personal marker in the band. Swaby, especially, poured himself into the songs. Between their 2012 album The Glorious Dead and the new record, Swaby has been married, divorced and re-married.  &ldquo;For me, a lot of the songs are about personal heartache and upset. I&rsquo;d just been through a divorce so that&rsquo;s where I was coming from,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d gone down this route of thinking that we needed to get married cos we had two children, and finding out very, very quickly that it was not gonna work. There&rsquo;s a lot you can draw from that emotional resolve. Songs like What Happened To The Love?, Mean Old Man, The Apology were necessary, they needed to be expelled from my system.&rdquo;  

The sweeping groove of Since You Been Gone came to Swaby as he sat on a tour bus in America contemplating his break-up. He imagined it as a Motown song until Taylor put some dirty guitar on top. Other tracks, such as the spiky garage-rock anthem What Happened To The Love?, came together in a whirl of adrenaline. &ldquo;We banged it out! That&rsquo;s the best song for me because it was effortless,&rdquo; says Taylor. The gospel-flecked Goodbye Baby was inspired by Taylor&rsquo;s own personal crisis during a US tour, whilst the Morricone-style glide of Nobody&rsquo;s Hero and thumping blues-rock of Slave To Your Love are the guitarist&rsquo;s odes to fatherhood. The mariachi-tinged Miss California, meanwhile, is the story of a faded beauty queen. The live feel of its recording set the tone for the rest of the record. 

Evoking the bedroom recordings of their early days, the album was self-produced and recorded close to home at The Distillery near Bath. The Distillery&rsquo;s remote location, at the end of a deserted track in the middle of nowhere, gave them a focus. Swaby explains: &ldquo;Living in Bath, you&rsquo;re allowed to lock yourselves away and no-one will disturb you. You can get in your lab and work on something individual. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like we&rsquo;re being influenced by any kind of social group. Here we can be creative and experimental.&rdquo; As well as sessions at The Distillery, they were also some recording stints in the studio at the bottom of Ellul&rsquo;s garden. Nobody&rsquo;s Hero was recorded there, and the drummer took on the job of much of the editing and programming on the album. &ldquo;Chris is an amazing musician, but he&rsquo;s become an incredible engineer and producer too,&rdquo; says Taylor.  

&ldquo;The Heavy is a fragile beast but it&rsquo;s a fragile beast that the four of us understand,&rdquo; says Swaby. &ldquo;The band has always been about taking the best part of our influences and making it work. We&rsquo;ve become really good alchemists to figure out exactly what we need.&rdquo; Everything they&rsquo;ve done over the past decade feels like it has been leading to this point. They&rsquo;ve mixed the lightning bolts of their live show with a batch of their strongest songs yet. It&rsquo;s the best they&rsquo;ve ever sounded.

Hurt &amp; The Merciless is released April 1st on Counter Records. The first single from the album will be Since You Been Gone

                                        Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance grew up together in the small Texas town of Magnolia. From a young age, they shared a love for music as well as the outdoors. At one point or another, music from Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Everly Brothers, to fellow Texans Willie Nelson, Guy Clark and Stevie Ray Vaughan found it&rsquo;s way through to them. At the age of 22, they moved to Austin and began to craft a sound of their own. Deeply rooted in harmony, they merged the sounds of the South with classic American and Western rock. 

Looking for adventure, as well as a change of pace, they eventually made the decision to head west and make the move to Los Angeles, CA. Throughout the course of the next 12 months, they wrote what is Jamestown Revival&rsquo;s first full-length album, UTAH. It&rsquo;s heavily autobiographical, telling the stories of their adventures, their discomforts, and their observations. In order to capture the spirit of the music, the two found a log cabin high within the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. The pair, along with their band and engineer, set out to convert it in to a temporary recording studio. With wild moose right outside the window, and aspen leaves spinning in the wind, they tracked the 11 songs that make up UTAH. Performed live, with no headphones, and entirely to tape, the process captured the moments in the room. 

Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance have since moved back to Austin and signed a record deal with Republic Records. Adding to the already soulful album, the band has since re-released UTAH to feature three brand new arrangements of the signature tracks. Through constant touring, the songs took on a life of their own, and these arrangements better reflect the songs as they are today. Teaming up with Republic gave Jonathan and Zach the chance to add to the album without sacrificing what was special about the original UTAH. It was a chance to go back and record the growth that has occurred over the past year, and add to an already strong collection of recordings.

                                        &quot;We were toying with the idea of calling the album Our Strongest Material To Date &rdquo;laughs Jeremy Schmidt. The Vancouver outfit&rsquo;s keyboardist can afford to joke about what they describe as &ldquo;the dog-eared ace of spades of all rock band platitudes.&quot; It was during a solo show under his Sinoia Caves alias that he performed a revelatory electronic prototype for Mothers Of The Sun. This  quintessentially Black Mountain tour de force kicks off the renamed but still accurately titled IV. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually an older song which we couldn&rsquo;t get quite right before,&rdquo; explains Schmidt. &ldquo;It has all the elements that we gravitate towards, built into one miniature epic.&rdquo;

Chief among these elements is the distinctive voice and breathtaking range of Amber Webber, whether she&rsquo;s powering through interstellar boogie on Florian Saucer Attack, setting the celestial tone for her beautifully orchestrated ballad Line Them All Up, or constructing the choral midsection for Space To Bakersfield, a psychedelic soul finale inspired by Funkadelic&#39;s deathless Maggot Brain. &ldquo;We&#39;d meant to have an actual choir, but I ended up singing all the parts. It&rsquo;s a choir of me! I&rsquo;d never written an arrangement like that before.&rdquo;

The group&rsquo;s sense of rediscovery as a creative whole is tangible throughout. They were joined in the studio by spiritually attuned bassist and veteran purveyor of the riff, Arjan Miranda (formerly of S.T.R.E.E.T.S, Children, and The Family Band) whose roots, heart and soul are connected to the same soil and cement that Black Mountain were borne from. Recording was primarily done in close collaboration with Sunn O))), Wolves In The Throne Room and Marissa Nadler producer Randall Dunn, at his trusted Avast! facility in Seattle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got some grit,&rdquo; enthuses guitarist and co-vocalist Stephen McBean.  &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a history there: Northwest punk, grunge and general weirdo outsider stuff, plus it houses the same Trident mixing board used for Alice Cooper&rsquo;s Billion Dollar Babies.&rdquo;

A heightened mystique and dramatic yearning can be heard on such perfectly formed earworms as Cemetery Breeding, described by drummer, engineer and occasional pianist Joshua Wells as &ldquo;a dark pop song with an emotive urgency to it that taps into my teenaged eyeliner-and-trenchcoat wearing sensibilities.&rdquo; Wells&rsquo; eclectic tastes and multitasking flair &ndash; his supple percussion also provides the backbone for Dan Bejar&rsquo;s world-conquering Destroyer ensemble &ndash; inform Black Mountain&rsquo;s wider palette as well as their rhythmic choices. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like painting. All sound colour. And space is really important. People think of us as this heavy rock band &ndash; and we are sometimes &ndash; but it has to be tempered with space. There has to be these emotional cues. It&rsquo;s not just about rocking out. 

&rdquo;Check out the way Amber and Stephen&rsquo;s harmonies telepathically entwine on cosmic standout Defector, or Constellations&rsquo; unforced confluence of synthesizer pulse and double denim riff. In addition to being blessed with a melodic facility that eludes most rock groups, Black Mountain effortlessly echo the limitless possibilities of the internet age. Sonic tributaries that never met in the real world &ndash; AC/DC and Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l, Heart and Hawkwind, King Crimson and Kraftwerk &ndash; flow together on IV as they do online. It fits with McBean&rsquo;s unifying theory of the modern YouTube stoner, wherein &ldquo;kids discover their own alternate universes online, from Cologne to Melbourne... Detroit to Laurel Canyon..  the ice age to annihilation. There&rsquo;s a new scene with a different set of headphones creating a postmodern futuristic Fantasy Island. All those fledgling heads in waiting escaping within their computer screens!&rdquo;

This impulse to connect is reflected by the band members&rsquo; activities and journeys outside the mothership. Josh and Amber have their self-run Balloon Factory studio and pop-noir Lightning Dust project. Stephen relocated to Los Angeles six years ago. Traveling and creating via his Southern Lord released hardcore unit Obliterations and ongoing post-punk rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll combo Pink Mountaintops (whose heady sometimes electronic throb led to the majestic, mantra-like You Can Dream). &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something very West Coast about us all.&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That rambling restlessness of keepin&rsquo; on guides us and keeps the music alive. Whether it&rsquo;s the gravitational pull of the Pacific Ocean that draws us back together or simply a good taco... The turning up, turning on and getting down is Black Mountain.  It&rsquo;s home, and it always feels good to come back to.&rdquo;

Back in Canada, meanwhile, Jeremy, channeled his analogue synth mastery and youthful John Carpenter worship into the hugely acclaimed cult science fiction film score 
Beyond The Black Rainbow. He&rsquo;s been busy of late conceptualizing Black Mountain&rsquo;s &ldquo;mystic Concorde&rdquo; art direction. Referencing the hallowed aircraft&rsquo;s future/past iconography, his designs are emblematic of IV&rsquo;s spatial diversity and maximalist astral-rock vision. You know, it really is their strongest material to date.

                                        New Zealand artist GIN WIGMORE is hitting the road with her band this Spring through USA and CANADA for her largest North American Tour ever. She will be joined by Chicago native Matthew Santos of Lupe Fiasco&rsquo;s feature fame &ldquo;SUPERSTAR&rdquo; and most recent album &ldquo;AS A CROW FLIES&rdquo; on all dates.

Gin Wigmore is an artist who is difficult to define, her sound is an eclectic mix of styles and influences,  the collective consensus being that Los Angeles based Gin is of a unique breed of soul infused rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll with a fierce attitude to match. 
If we had to put a label in, it would read something like this: alternative rock and neo-soul, biting lyricism, with a gravelly vocal that takes you on a very personal ride. 

Her most recent album, BLOOD TO BONE is Wigmore&rsquo;s third studio album and has been described as &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; - Stereogum; &ldquo;Her best release to date&rdquo; - The Music (AU); &rdquo;Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll with a pop inflected driving rhythm beneath her soulful crooner vocals&rdquo; - Paste.

Hot off the heels from a SOLD OUT TOUR in 2015 and BEST FEMALE ARTIST award in her native homeland, GIN WIGMORE will be covering a lot of ground for the March through May tour and playing songs from all three albums including brilliant tracks &ldquo;NEW RUSH&rdquo;, &ldquo;WRITTEN IN THE WATER&rdquo; and newest single, &ldquo;WILLING TO DIE.&rdquo;
The tour will kick off in DC and end in Los Angeles.

                                        Since the release of Kvelertak&rsquo;s eponymous debut album in 2010, the band have traversed the globe playing over 500 shows in 4 continents over the last 4 years, and picking up three Norwegian Grammy&rsquo;s (Spellemann awards). They have supported Converge, Foo Fighters, Mastodon, Metallica, Kiss, and most recently Anthrax and Slayer on a European wide tour.

The critical acclaim for this first record saw the band labeled &ldquo;the best Norwegian debut album of all time&rdquo; by Norwegian rock authority Asbj&oslash;rn Slettemark and &ldquo;the best Norwegian band since A-Ha&rdquo; by Simon Young of Kerrang, the album delivered near perfect marks from magazine reviews across Europe, US and Australia: 

9/10 Metal Hammer (UK), 8.5/10 Terrorizer (UK), 88/100 Aardschok (NL), 4/5 Kerrang! (UK), 4/5 MetalSucks (US), 9/10 Decibel (US), 9/10 Rock Hard (DE), 4/5 Zero Tolerance (AUS).

This worldwide acclaim and success is made all the more remarkable by the fact that the band, unlike most rock band that succeed internationally, they sing in Norwegian.

For their second release, Meir, in March 2013, the band set up their own label, W&oslash;rld Rec&oslash;rds, to produce the album and then licenced it to major label partners &ndash; Sony in the Scandinavian region and RoadRunner Records for the rest of the world.

The second album received even greater acclaim both in Norway and around the world, debuting at #1 on the Norwegian album charts. The band increased their touring base in North America, as well as sold out European and Nordic headline tours (2 nights at Rockefeller) &ndash; including 21 Norwegian shows.

Meir received album of the week reviews in every major rock publication around the world, and filled the end of year polls in mainstream as well as specialist media.

Highlights included: #2 on SPIN&rsquo;s Metal Albums of 2013, #2 on Rolling Stones Best Metal Albums of 2013, Rolling Stones 27 Best album&rsquo;s you didn&rsquo;t hear, New York Times Best Song of 2013 list, #15 on Stereogum&rsquo;s Best Albums of 2013 (all genres), #4 on Revolver&rsquo;s album of the year.

The band is currently working on their third album for release in Spring 2016 and will be touring around the world to support the album from April 2016.

                                            <br/>
                                            
                                        Over the decade and a half that Rogue Wave has made music, Zach Rogue has continued to expand his band&rsquo;s emotional spectrum. Drawing inspiration from the inevitable delusions of everyday American life, Rogue, his longtime bandmate Pat Spurgeon, and their fellow members have returned reinvigorated, and with a fresh sound founded on the art of patience, the fearlessness of experimenting, and the unbridled joy of creating something meaningful to help us navigate through these vacant times. Trusting in its own abilities and leaning on each other, Rogue Wave has seized creative control of its identity and sound and is set to smash any preconceptions of its music, revealing the most truthful, powerful, and urgent sonic blueprint of the band to date.

Taking a longer break in between albums than ever before, Rogue enjoyed his extra time off at home in Oakland with his children. The songwriting process for Rogue Wave&rsquo;s music is always the same&mdash;&ldquo;me, alone in a room,&rdquo; as Rogue says&mdash;and this time around, he found the most success at home in his bedroom or while driving in his car, even learning to embrace his two-year-old son&rsquo;s &ldquo;experimental tunings&rdquo; on his beloved Taylor guitar. Lyrics, however, did not come as easy, and Rogue only found success with his words when slowing himself down and recognizing that his wild juxtapositions of lyrical themes actually felt right. &ldquo;I wanted the duality,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I wanted the thematic conflict. This is a record of things being out of balance and at odds with one another.&rdquo; Thematically, Rogue Wave&rsquo;s music has never drifted too far from the subject matter of emotional battles with fear and joy in equal parts.

Choosing to title the record Delusions of Grand Fur, a riff on the tendency of fresh-faced musicians to misperceive the reality of band life, Rogue found himself reflecting on all that he had learned through his time in Rogue Wave, in addition to our need as humans to keep up appearances. &ldquo;You think the world will be your oyster and the wounds you were running away from when you joined a band will magically go away&mdash;you think you can just become someone else or get whatever you want,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But really, we are all deluded in some way. We need to delude ourselves to deal with the impossibility and difficulty of life. Delusion is what keeps the mythology of America alive. It keeps us from facing our history and our true selves. We don&rsquo;t want to be deluded. We need it.&rdquo; And once he had convinced Spurgeon of the sincere intent behind the titular pun, they began the recording process.

In a sense a return to their recording roots, Rogue and Spurgeon decided to work without a producer, instead recording and producing themselves at their home studio in Oakland. Calling to mind the band&rsquo;s debut, 2003&rsquo;s Out of the Shadow, a project completed entirely by Rogue and a single engineer, the band also decided to work without recording demo versions of songs&mdash;instead, the demos would simply become the songs. Setting up shop amongst their large collection of well-loved gear at the place they felt most comfortable, the band was free to experiment at will&mdash;rarely would they rehearse a song as a band first, instead choosing to tinker and jump off the deep end as Rogue and Spurgeon desired, blessing the process with what seemed like a natural evolution. At times, bassist Mark Masanori Christianson and the band&rsquo;s new guitar player Jon Monohan would come by to throw in some ideas. But by and large the architects remained Rogue and Spurgeon, resulting in a revelatory experience and so many songs the band could have potentially released a double album. The process taught them to trust their instincts while embracing the fleeting energy of an imaginative spark.

&ldquo;It was really nice working at our own pace,&rdquo; says Rogue. &ldquo;We wanted to just go with our own instincts and trust ourselves. Pat really blossomed as an engineer during this record. His curiosity in the studio is just endless. There are no rules. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always been so comfortable bringing song ideas to him, because he is so open.&rdquo; Spurgeon played all the drums on the record, as well as a bit of everything else. In Rogue&rsquo;s words, even Spurgeon&rsquo;s experiments became instruments all of their own, and despite the modest environment and DIY approach, the end result is a clearer snapshot of who Rogue Wave is today.

&ldquo;In a way, it could be argued that we chose the most regressive step by tracking our record in such a comparatively low fidelity environment,&rdquo; says Rogue. &ldquo;But for the music itself, it is the trajectory I&rsquo;ve always wanted for this band. It&rsquo;s the sound of who we actually are, for better or for worse.&rdquo;

Echoing that sentiment, Delusions of Grand Fur opens on a confident tone with the upbeat and personal &ldquo;Take It Slow,&rdquo; a song inspired by a mantra of patience. The energy takes off on the next track, &ldquo;In the Morning,&rdquo; which was given its gyrating, infectious pulse by the deft hands of its mixer, Chris Walla. And the bright clip of &ldquo;California Bride,&rdquo; perhaps the tone that will prove most familiar to longtime fans, is a meditation on the beauty and fortune of being alive. &ldquo;Do you even know how lucky you are?&rdquo; says Rogue of the song. &ldquo;You got to live in California and feel the sand in your toes and grab what you wanted from life.&rdquo;

But when the dark indie pop of lead single &ldquo;What Is Left To Solve&rdquo; opens the second half of the album with electronic flourishes, it&rsquo;s clear that a new, exciting direction is being heralded. Originally written on guitar, the duo was inspired to deconstruct the song by listening to electronic music by Kraftwerk and Grimes. &ldquo;The synth bass line is meant to represent the futility of thinking you will get a different result when you try to change someone else,&rdquo; says Rogue. &ldquo;We are slowly but surely replacing human interaction with digital interaction.&rdquo;

Continuing the fresh foray, &ldquo;Frozen Lake&rdquo; is an interpersonal breakup song that evokes sounds of the &rsquo;80s, the present, and the future all at once, while the jangly, psychedelic &ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; is an instant smash about breaking up, and how getting stabbed in the back can leave you feeling infinitesimally small. When Mike Deni of Geographer lends his soaring voice to the track&rsquo;s bridge, the tune rises to the rafters. By the time the album reaches its close with the slow-burning, achingly lush &ldquo;Memento Mori,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s clear that Delusions of Grand Fur is a masterstroke by a band that knows who it is and has continued to evolve. Rogue Wave has released a work that serves as a culmination of all it has learned and that trusts itself over all else to deliver that message with a supreme urgency.

&ldquo;Overall, I think we have grown more comfortable in our own skin,&rdquo; say Rogue. &ldquo;We had total control; we were on our own little island and made the record entirely for our own amusement. As a result, there are some pretty experimental tendencies. It is pretty immersive. There are some very emotional moments. But my relationship with Pat continues to grow. In many ways, I feel like we are just starting to figure out how we like to record music. This record was the most challenging album we&rsquo;ve ever worked on, but it never felt like a slog. When we are working on songs together, it just never feels old.&rdquo;

                                            <br/>
                                            
                                        &quot;I&#39;ve got four faces,&quot; Elliphant declares. &quot;One of them is the crazy club girl. Then, there&#39;s my hip-hop side. I can also get all R&amp;B on you. A lot of the time, I just feel like a hippie.&quot; All four of those &quot;faces&quot; peek through the Swedish pop maverick&#39;s second EP, One More [Kemosabe Records/Record Company TEN]. It&#39;s a musical patchwork that&#39;s as warm as it is wild. After the success of her first stateside EP, Look Like You Love It, Elliphant holed up in Los Angeles for the majority of 2014, locking herself in the studio and writing countless songs. During the process, the girl legally known as Ellinor Olovsdotter experienced something of a revelation. &quot;I want to be an artist that reflects reality in everything&mdash;good and bad,&quot; she admits. &quot;Life is always changing, and I want to be a reflection of what life is. You never have to choose black and white; you can stay in the grey zone. While you&#39;re there, be experimental as long as you&#39;re true to who you are. Music isn&#39;t meant to be solid. It&#39;s fluid. The music is a little more naked now. It really shows who I am.&quot;

Teaming up with Grammy Award-winning producer Joel Little [Lorde, Broods], her approach yielded the intoxicating, yet intricate title track &quot;One More&quot; featuring M&Oslash;. As soon as she unveiled the single, it became the &quot;#1 Most Tweeted Song on Twitter&quot;, while its clever and cinematic music video racked up over 500,000 views in less than month. A snappy beat kicks off this ride as the vibe veers between rap cadence and electro pop sheen. At the center of it all, Elliphant offers an unbridled and unfiltered vignette into her life. The song&#39;s infectious exterior belies its dark underbelly. &quot;It&#39;s about my girls at home,&quot; she continues. &quot;We have this pretty intense crew in Sweden of six or seven girls. It&#39;s a bittersweet group. We all come from the same part of Stockholm. We all have single mothers with problems. When we go out drinking or partying, we talk about fucked up things. It&#39;s friendship; but it&#39;s also loneliness. Usually, only one of us has money, but we drink together and let it all out.&quot;

On the other end of the spectrum, she examines love for the first time on the shimmering, yet sassy &quot;Never Been In Love&quot;. Once again, it&#39;s balanced by her ability to assume multiple perspectives and view life from numerous angles. &quot;I was alone in L.A. for a month,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I got so inspired by the idea of falling in love. I never wrote about love before. Now, I&#39;m writing about it because I want to start exposing my system to the idea of being with someone. It&#39;s a break from the fear and bullshit of what goes on in this world. If you open the doors to the mystery of this planet, you can experience so much.&quot; That vulnerability somewhat explains her own musical boundlessness &ndash; leading to collaborations with everybody from Skrillex to Bunji Garlin and Diplo.

As she made waves overseas in 2012, well-known producer Dr. Luke also fell under her spell, signing her in collaboration with Record Company TEN to his own Kemosabe Records in the United States. 2014 saw her hit the road supporting Charli XCX on a nationwide tour that packed houses nightly, exposing her to a whole new audience along the way. Plus, Elliphant has won over top tastemakers including Pitchfork, FADER, and many more. Ultimately though, Elliphant wants everybody to enjoy One More with her. She smiles, &quot;It&#39;s music for any occasion. There are happy moments. There&#39;s energy. There&#39;s darkness. I hope it can be your soundtrack.&quot;

                                        The story of Mura Masa is one to remind people that there&rsquo;s still room for optimism about the &ldquo;internet generation&rdquo;. At just 19, Alex Crossan has shown how someone with an appetite for knowledge, even if their upbringing has been isolated, can make full use of having the world at their fingertips without getting overwhelmed by &ldquo;too much information&rdquo;. Not only that, but again and again he&rsquo;s proving that it&rsquo;s possible parlay the myriad of potential influences that are available to anyone with a broadband connection into something unique, coherent, future-facing and very, very popular. Like, Diplo and Skrillex co-signed popular. 30-million-plays on SoundCloud popular.

Alex grew up on the island of Guernsey where &ldquo;everybody knows each other&rdquo; but the opportunities for young people, as he laconically puts it, &ldquo;are basically: hang around beaches and drink.&rdquo; Most people who&rsquo;ve grown up in small-town or rural environments can probably relate to the outdoor&hellip; socialising &ndash; but this was an extreme case. It&rsquo;s not like you could even get a bus to the nearest big city if you wanted to go to a gig: the equivalent would be a five-hour ferry trip to Southampton. So culture tended to be a DIY affair out of necessity: Alex surfed (not to &ldquo;be a surfer&rdquo;, but just because literally everyone surfs there), and played in a variety of indie bands with his friends.

&ldquo;I think I was very disconnected from British music,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My mum is American and I was exposed to a lot of her records at first &ndash; Joni Mitchell and stuff &ndash; and from there I think I assumed pop culture was American. I certainly didn&rsquo;t know anything about dubstep or grime, or club music &ndash; I guess if I thought about that stuff it seemed pretty far away from what I knew. I&rsquo;d never been to London!&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t exactly conservative in his tastes, but felt no need to investigate anything far removed from a standard diet of indie and rock, seasoned with a little radio pop.

Then two things happened: firstly, around the time he turned 15, Alex &ldquo;heard Hudson Mohawke&rsquo;s &lsquo;Thunder Bay&rsquo; and discovered that electronic music was a thing,&rdquo; and then he stumbled on James Blake &ldquo;and realised how far you can go with it!&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s where the internet-digging began. &ldquo;I like to do my homework,&rdquo; he deadpans, before explaining how via YouTube and streaming he steadily inhaled first the entire discographies of these artists, then of musicians in their circles &ndash; SBTRKT and Cashmere Cat were early favourites &ndash; then of the sounds that influenced all of these. Flying Lotus style psychedelic beats, grime, WARP style electronica &ndash; but also bands like The Smiths: it was all grist for the mill as he furiously processed beatmaking and songwriting.

And as he absorbed the music, spotting connections, influences and echoes through the beats and riffs, something else was happening which was crucial to how his own music would explode into the world. Because he was taking in information about the music and its subcultures so quickly, and because there&rsquo;s a keen analytical mind lurking behind the laid-back exterior, he became very aware of a bigger picture, of how bedroom producers could shake the world. &ldquo;James Blake is so important as an act,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Not just because the music&rsquo;s great and I love listening to it, which I do, but in terms of the way music&rsquo;s going: the fact that an act like that can be recognised in the way he is really opened my eyes a bit.&rdquo;

So maybe it shouldn&rsquo;t be that much of a surprise that Alex&rsquo;s very early beat experiments started setting Soundcloud alight very quickly. It&rsquo;s not that he exactly set out with a world domination plan, but armed with this big-picture knowledge, he was making his music with full understanding of how far it can reach, and how quickly. As he worked on coalescing his own individual sound from the vast array of influences he was amassing, he watched his electronic music heroes crashing the mainstream without compromising their musical vision, and he learned about how bands like The Smiths took their very particular vision into the charts. Everything he learned increased the understanding that it wasn&rsquo;t an either/or thing: you can make cool, exploratory beats and songs and reach out to a mass audience and echo through the wider culture.

Mura Musa (&ldquo;the name just came from a track name on a metal album, and it comes from an old Japanese myth about a swordsmith, but really I just thought it sounded cool&rdquo; laughs Alex) was already starting to become quite significant thanks to this Soundcloud snowballing by the time he left Guernsey for university in Brighton. Indeed he already had label attention and representation: his soon-to-be manager Sam spotted him on SoundCloud, got in touch, and immediately proved his commitment by making the trip out to Guernsey to meet Alex on spec. Alex may have &ldquo;really, really felt like a small fish in a big pond&rdquo; having left the tight-knit community of the island, but he was ready to crack on.

He made it through a year of an English Literature and Philosophy degree before &ldquo;music took over: not in a malicious way, but just because I literally didn&rsquo;t have time to do both.&rdquo; His focus was total on &ldquo;having an ethos and an attitude of writing music that&rsquo;s very culturally relevant, that lasts, that&rsquo;s important lyrically and sonically as well.&rdquo; Musical collaborations were sparked online &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d find myself contacting someone via SoundCloud or whatever, saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a fan of you&rsquo; and they&rsquo;d go &lsquo;oh that&rsquo;s nice, I&rsquo;m a fan of you too!&rsquo; which is a pretty good sign that you might be able to work together,&rdquo; he muses.

The fact that collaborations, on the whole, came naturally was very important to Alex, and chimed with everything he&rsquo;d learned from his self-driven musical education about how the best artists preserve their individuality. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ve been a few suggestions about working with this or that big name singer,&rdquo; he laughs, &ldquo;but I really have to think about what that says about the music and whether it&rsquo;ll overshadow it.&rdquo; Before very long at all, he was weighing up deals, but eventually went with the major label that would not only give him creative freedom but set him up with his own imprint. His debut album is well underway, and he&rsquo;s determined to keep that freedom and &ndash; like his early inspiration James Blake &ndash; deliver a debut that is a complete creative statement, not designed by committee.

Where he&rsquo;ll go from here is a mind-boggling thing to consider, but calm as ever, Alex seems ready for whatever comes next. For now he&rsquo;s taking in his stride the growth of a young and excitable following who turn up for his shows and are even starting to sing along to some of the tracks. He never writes or structures songs with the live stage in mind, but he is beginning to turn over thoughts about pulling together a proper band to perform them, &ldquo;because if you&rsquo;re going to do Glastonbury or whatever you don&rsquo;t want to just be standing up there hitting a drum pad.&rdquo; He may have considered himself culturally isolated on his island home, but this child of the internet generation is now ready to make a serious mark on the big, wide, real world.

                                        Here&rsquo;s the deal. In 2012, people loved Silver Age (to a degree that surprised me, pleasantly), likewise Beauty &amp; Ruin in 2014 (despite the heaviness of the subject matter, which I thought might be a bit alienating... apparently not. Another pleasant surprise.).

But PATCH THE SKY is the darkest one.

After the Letterman performance in February 2015 where &ldquo;dust fell from the rafters,&rdquo; it would have seemed logical to go the punk rock route&mdash;an entire album of two&shy;minute songs&mdash;but that wasn&rsquo;t where my soul was at. 

I withdrew from everyday life. I wrote alone for six months. I love people, but I needed my solitude. The search for my own truth kept me alive. These songs are my salvation.

I&rsquo;ve had a solid stretch of hard emotional times, and thanks for the condolences in advance. I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details&mdash;more death, relationships ending, life getting shorter&mdash;because they&rsquo;re already in the songs. Just listen and see if you can fit yourself into my stories. The words make you remember. The music makes you forget.

But PATCH THE SKY is also the catchiest one.

I always aim for the perfect balance of bright melodies and dark stories. I&rsquo;ve used this juxtaposition for years. This time, I&rsquo;ve tuned it to high contrast.

The first side of the album is generally simple and catchy. The second side is heavier in spirit and tone. Opposing forces and properties. I love both sides of PATCH THE SKY.

At the core of these songs is what I call the chemical chorus&mdash;you hear it once and your brain starts tingling. The heart rate picks up. It gets worse&mdash;you know it&rsquo;s coming again and you can barely stand the anticipation. Then, the beautifully heartbreaking bridge appears, and you&rsquo;re all set up&mdash;hooked for life. Music is an incredibly powerful drug. I want to be your drug dealer. I have what you need.

On the current band.

I&rsquo;m currently in the best band in the world with Jon Wurster on drums and Jason Narducy on bass. We&rsquo;ve been working together since March 2008. Jon and Jason are involved in many quality projects, and I&rsquo;m amazed they find the time to play music with me. I am always thankful for their contributions.

On the recording process.

Beau Sorenson engineered the tracking sessions at Electrical Audio in Chicago. We all played really hard, and I used very loud amps. We mixed PATCH THE SKY at Different Fur in San Francisco. Bob Weston mastered the album at Chicago Mastering Service. Sonically, it&rsquo;s deeper and richer than the previous two albums.

On the state of my music.

Beyond the aforementioned trials of life, I found myself thinking about the 1970s, where heavy metal, soft rock, and confessional singer/songwriters collided (and gay porno was better). I circled back to the forgotten sounds of my teen years, and how I used to absorb, learn, and emulate in order to create.

When I was younger, I always felt the need to justify my work. These days, I don&rsquo;t have time or energy for that. I only want to finish the songs that get stuck in my head for days and weeks and months on end. And add lots of guitar solos.

On the last campaign, I had a song called &ldquo;Little Glass Pill&rdquo; that talked about &ldquo;a window and a mirror.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what music is to me, both as creator and lifelong fan. The window&mdash;where you can see inside my soul. The mirror&mdash;where I look to find my own truth. When the inspiration hits, roll with it. Write what you live, love, and know.

On gratitude.

Apparently I&rsquo;ve been given some special dispensation. How many musicians get to play loud rock at 55 and still have an audience?

It&rsquo;s amazing that people from so many different cities, countries, ages, and walks of life all continue to find something in common in my music. I take the art form very seriously; I appreciate being recognized for my efforts, and I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for the time I&rsquo;ve had in the light. I like the brightness, and Lord knows I&rsquo;ve got darkness covered.

* * *

Anyhow&mdash;let&rsquo;s try to make something enjoyable out of all the heaviness of life and death and love and failure and fear and regret that we all go through. Talk with me about normal stuff. Ask me fun questions. I&rsquo;ll say some crazy shit because I&rsquo;m old. Kids will think I&rsquo;m out of touch with modern times. I love it. Let&rsquo;s do it.

                                        Here&rsquo;s the deal. In 2012, people loved Silver Age (to a degree that surprised me, pleasantly), likewise Beauty &amp; Ruin in 2014 (despite the heaviness of the subject matter, which I thought might be a bit alienating... apparently not. Another pleasant surprise.).

But PATCH THE SKY is the darkest one.

After the Letterman performance in February 2015 where &ldquo;dust fell from the rafters,&rdquo; it would have seemed logical to go the punk rock route&mdash;an entire album of two&shy;minute songs&mdash;but that wasn&rsquo;t where my soul was at. 

I withdrew from everyday life. I wrote alone for six months. I love people, but I needed my solitude. The search for my own truth kept me alive. These songs are my salvation.

I&rsquo;ve had a solid stretch of hard emotional times, and thanks for the condolences in advance. I don&rsquo;t want to go into the details&mdash;more death, relationships ending, life getting shorter&mdash;because they&rsquo;re already in the songs. Just listen and see if you can fit yourself into my stories. The words make you remember. The music makes you forget.

But PATCH THE SKY is also the catchiest one.

I always aim for the perfect balance of bright melodies and dark stories. I&rsquo;ve used this juxtaposition for years. This time, I&rsquo;ve tuned it to high contrast.

The first side of the album is generally simple and catchy. The second side is heavier in spirit and tone. Opposing forces and properties. I love both sides of PATCH THE SKY.

At the core of these songs is what I call the chemical chorus&mdash;you hear it once and your brain starts tingling. The heart rate picks up. It gets worse&mdash;you know it&rsquo;s coming again and you can barely stand the anticipation. Then, the beautifully heartbreaking bridge appears, and you&rsquo;re all set up&mdash;hooked for life. Music is an incredibly powerful drug. I want to be your drug dealer. I have what you need.

On the current band.

I&rsquo;m currently in the best band in the world with Jon Wurster on drums and Jason Narducy on bass. We&rsquo;ve been working together since March 2008. Jon and Jason are involved in many quality projects, and I&rsquo;m amazed they find the time to play music with me. I am always thankful for their contributions.

On the recording process.

Beau Sorenson engineered the tracking sessions at Electrical Audio in Chicago. We all played really hard, and I used very loud amps. We mixed PATCH THE SKY at Different Fur in San Francisco. Bob Weston mastered the album at Chicago Mastering Service. Sonically, it&rsquo;s deeper and richer than the previous two albums.

On the state of my music.

Beyond the aforementioned trials of life, I found myself thinking about the 1970s, where heavy metal, soft rock, and confessional singer/songwriters collided (and gay porno was better). I circled back to the forgotten sounds of my teen years, and how I used to absorb, learn, and emulate in order to create.

When I was younger, I always felt the need to justify my work. These days, I don&rsquo;t have time or energy for that. I only want to finish the songs that get stuck in my head for days and weeks and months on end. And add lots of guitar solos.

On the last campaign, I had a song called &ldquo;Little Glass Pill&rdquo; that talked about &ldquo;a window and a mirror.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what music is to me, both as creator and lifelong fan. The window&mdash;where you can see inside my soul. The mirror&mdash;where I look to find my own truth. When the inspiration hits, roll with it. Write what you live, love, and know.

On gratitude.

Apparently I&rsquo;ve been given some special dispensation. How many musicians get to play loud rock at 55 and still have an audience?

It&rsquo;s amazing that people from so many different cities, countries, ages, and walks of life all continue to find something in common in my music. I take the art form very seriously; I appreciate being recognized for my efforts, and I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for the time I&rsquo;ve had in the light. I like the brightness, and Lord knows I&rsquo;ve got darkness covered.

Anyhow&mdash;let&rsquo;s try to make something enjoyable out of all the heaviness of life and death and love and failure and fear and regret that we all go through. Talk with me about normal stuff. Ask me fun questions. I&rsquo;ll say some crazy shit because I&rsquo;m old. Kids will think I&rsquo;m out of touch with modern times. I love it. Let&rsquo;s do it.

                                        Damien Jurado&#39;s musical career began with the release of his debut &#39;Water Ave S&#39; on Sub Pop in 1997. He went on to release three more records for the Seattle label before joining Secretly Canadian, a move marked by the release of 2003&#39;s &#39;Where Shall You Take Me?&#39;, a return to his trademark low-key folk-ballad style. Early in 2005 his next full-length, &#39;On My Way to Absence&#39;, arrived. Jurado continued to keep busy with &#39;And Now That I&#39;m in Your Shadow&#39;, a spare, hushed collection of songs that arrived late in 2006; early the following year, &#39;Gathered in Song&#39; was reissued with bonus tracks. His eighth full-length, &#39;Caught in the Trees&#39;, arrived in 2008, followed by the Richard Swift-produced &#39;Saint Bartlett&#39; (2011) and &#39;Maraqopa&#39; (2012).

                                        Eric D. Johnson was ready to drive the car off the cliff. He bristles at the memory and 
the metaphor. Instead, he recalls, he and his wife drove their Toyota Echo&mdash;so old it lacked power locks&mdash;through the Redwood forest the day they got the bad news. 
Their baby, due on his wife&rsquo;s 40th birthday, didn&rsquo;t make it past the first trimester.  

&quot;I was so grief-stricken,&quot; recalls Johnson. &quot;I wanted to blow up my life.&quot;

And so he started over. He abandoned the Fruit Bats band name that carried him for 16 years and five successful studio albums. He ditched the moniker that connected him to tints playing with The Shins and Vetiver and Califone. Instead, Johnson continued pursuing other musical passions. He focused more on scoring films (having already contributed to works like Smashed and Our Idiot Brother). He produced Breathe Owl Breathe&rsquo;s 2013 album Passage of Pegasus and grew his Huichica Music Festival in Sonoma, California.  

Then, in 2014, Johnson released a solo album. That record, released under his own 
name and simply titled EDJ, &quot;was the outpouring of grief&quot; resulting from those experiences. 

&quot;The EDJ record was about how making something&mdash;like a person&mdash;is really easy for some people and really not for some people,&quot; he says. &quot;I was so sad about that, but also fearful to discuss it.&quot;

In the process of grieving, reflecting, and resigning himself to his new realities, Johnson realized how much weight a name can carry and how much of his sense of self was contained in just two small words. 

Eric D. Johnson is Fruit Bats. And Fruit Bats is back.  

&quot;I&rsquo;m finding my identity again,&quot; he begins, &quot;which is somehow, weirdly this dumb fake punk rock name that I put on a four-track tape.&quot; 

Fruit Bats&rsquo; sixth album Absolute Loser represents a triumphant return to name, form, and self. Despite implications, its title refers to the furthest depths of loss itself, rather than the state of those who have lost something. It&rsquo;s the most honest, most confessional album of Fruit Bats&rsquo; career.

Johnson draws from deeply those personal experiences, yet Absolute Loser encapsulates universal themes and emotions. While &quot;My Sweet Midwest&quot; could be 
taken completely literally, it addresses the holistic nature of finding your center during turmoil. &quot;Baby Bluebird&quot; stings in its portrayal of losing what you never really had. Album closer &quot;Don&rsquo;t You Know That&quot; is about picking yourself up, even when no one seems to care how far you fell. 

Musically, Absolute Loser retains the same structural pop elements that made Fruit 
Bats so beloved in the first place. Its simple sounding melodies belie such thick musical textures, as some tracks incorporate up to 10 guitar tracks layered on top of each other. Johnson also hearkens back to his days teaching banjo at Chicago&rsquo;s Old Town School of Folk Music, and that instrumentation adds a folksy, Americana spirit to record.

Fruit Bats&rsquo; rebirth parallels Johnson&rsquo;s resiliency, and Absolute Loser is his treaty on how to redefine oneself after tragedy. Although he maintains that he doesn&rsquo;t have it all figured out quite yet, Johnson acknowledges that with that self-awareness comes some sort of acceptance.  

&quot;I am what I am,&quot; he says. &quot;And that&rsquo;s freeing in a way.&quot;

                                            <br/>
                                            
                                        Like many of the world&rsquo;s greatest artists, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are one of the most difficult bands to pin down. The Australian-based septet constantly zig when you think they&rsquo;re about to zag. 

Starting out in 2010 as a solid garage rock group, they&rsquo;ve followed their collective muse wherever it chose to lead them, whether that be the bluesy alien psychedelia of their 2014 album Oddments or the expansive, almost jazzy, Dead-like head trips of Quarters! Or as frontman Stu Mackenzie puts it, &ldquo;I always wanted to be a band where you would expect the unexpected each time, with each album being treated like a different phase.&rdquo; 

For their latest opus, they initially thought it was going to be filled with the darker, heavier material that the band has been playing live of late. But Mackenzie soon decided that it was time to put aside the longer, more conceptual pieces and go in a completely new direction. Hence, the band&rsquo;s seventh album Paper M&acirc;ch&eacute; Dream Balloon was recorded using nothing but acoustic instruments. The result is a lovely, lilting pop masterpiece that still evokes the same intoxicating exuberance as KGATLW&rsquo;s most recent work, but with a more pastoral, communal feel to it. 

That spirit came alive in the writing and recording process. Unlike the last two albums, there is no overarching theme tying it all together. So, rather than cooking the whole thing up as a group in the studio or rehearsal space, the various members of KGATLW wrote separately, bringing their songs to the group as they finished them. &ldquo;There was a lot of collaboration,&rdquo; says Mackenzie, &ldquo;but in smaller combinations.&rdquo; 

That could have made for a schizophrenic batch of tunes, but the band are so deeply connected at this point that they each reached the same sonic conclusions, combining the rambling pulse of T. Rex (&ldquo;The Bitter Boogie&rdquo;), the free-spirited bliss of The Free Design (&ldquo;Dirt&rdquo;), and the countryside wanderings of late &lsquo;60s Kinks (&ldquo;Bone&rdquo;, &ldquo;Most of What I Like&rdquo;). 

While embracing the limitations of their choice of only acoustic sounds, KGATLW were able to get a little experimental as well. To fill out the sound, they borrowed a batch of instruments that they had never played before&mdash;clarinet, double bass, and cello, among them&mdash;and eked sounds and melodies out of them. That only helps to add to joyous jumble that is Paper M&acirc;ch&eacute; Dream Balloon. 

Too, the band eschewed traditional recording methods for most of this new LP. The bare bones of many of the songs were laid down by Mackenzie in a shipping container that sat on his parents&rsquo; farm on the Victorian coast of Australia. From there, the band stitched the rest of it together with overdubs and new recordings in their bedrooms and home studios, outside of the closing instrumental &ldquo;Paper M&acirc;ch&eacute;,&rdquo; which was captured with the help of Unknown Mortal Orchestra bassist Jake Portrait while they were in New York. 

As ever, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard aren&rsquo;t going to rest in this acoustic wonderland for long. The band is already gearing up for another long stretch of touring, where they will be adapting some of these tunes for their electrified lineup as well as returning to the heavier material they were already working on. 

&ldquo;I think everyone knows what this band is about,&rdquo; Mackenzie says. &ldquo;I have always been afraid of being pigeonholed. The band personality is to try and do something that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect.&rdquo; 

Mission accomplished.

In 2015, Newcombe returned to the themes of Aufheben with Musique de film imagin&eacute;, a collection of soundtrack cues for a nonexistent movie, inspired by his love of classic French cinema. A seven-song collection of new, more rock-based material arrived later that year under the amusing title of Mini Album Thingy Wingy.

                                        After the Baby I&rsquo;m Yours EP and a few other similar projects, Breakbot released his debut album in 2012 on Ed Banger. By Your Side, a sun-filled soundtrack with cheeky writing, where the bass line and the guitar answered each other in a rhythmic lovefest.

Together, Breakbot and Irfane have presented By Your Side in all the big cities of the world on a tour that has lasted almost two years. This long meandering finally gave the two friends the idea to create a duo.

In 2016, the new Breakbot version &ldquo;one plus one&rdquo; will release a second album, Still Waters, a new assortment of southern sunrays, with swinging images of dancefloors filled with guys in flowing trousers and bare-shouldered young girls.

Unlike the previous album, this one is more of a matrix with intricate workmanship, carved out with the help of old analogue machines rather than softwares. Thirteen bouncy acts with Stevie Wonder and the Motown crowd in the background, spouts of funk and disco on a well-trodden dancefloor.

Crafty ideas whipped-up in a vintage outfit with techno vibes and futuristic accelerations creating a perfectly current soundtrack. Tomorrow&rsquo;s retro that they will present all around France &amp; Europe.

                                        Tim Heidecker was born and raised in Allentown, PA. As a freshman film student at Temple University he met Eric Wareheim. After graduation they continued to work together on short films and strange bits of comedic nonsense. 

One of their first pieces was Tom Goes to The Mayor, which made its way into various film festivals. Fueled by Tom&#39;s success Tim and Eric began sending their tapes to their comedic heroes in Hollywood. One of those recipient&#39;s being Bob Odenkirk who loved what he saw and helped to develop their ideas into a TV show. Through a chance meeting they were able to get their tapes to the senior vice president of Adult Swim, Mike Lazzo. 
He loved the stuff and they were immediately given the funds for development. Tim and Eric used some of the money to move to Hollywood where they worked on the show for a two season, 30 episode run. 

Tim later went on to again collaborate with Eric Wareheim on their next show, the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! Which aired five seasons on Cartoon Network. Tim and Eric also created a spin off show starring John C. Reilly called Check It Out! With Dr. Steve Brule, which has run for two seasons. Tim has also collaborated with Eric on big budget commercials for brands like Old Spice, Red Stripe, and Boost Mobile. 

In 2012 Tim co-wrote, directed, and starred in his first feature film, Tim and Eric&#39;s Billion Dollar Movie, which was produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. 
Tim&#39;s most recent collaboration with Eric was for an anthology series, Tim and Eric&#39;s Bedtime Stories. Season two premiered in November of 2015 with two new half hour specials for Adult Swim. The series included guest stars such as John C. Reilly, Jason Schwartzman, and Zach Galifianakis in a dark stylistic departure from their usual comedy shows. 

Tim also has a musical side project Heidecker &amp; Wood with Davin Wood, the composer of all things Tim and Eric. Heidecker &amp; Wood&#39;s second album &quot;Some Things Never Stay The Same&quot; was released in November of 2013 and they continue to play live shows and work on new music together.

                                        To create his fifth full-length album Start Livin&#39;, Hawaii-based singer/guitarist/songwriter Donavon Frankenreiter holed up in a Southern California studio for seven days with his longtime bassist Matt Grundy&mdash;and no one else. The follow-up to 2010&#39;s Glow, Start Livin&#39; is a nine-track selection of folk-infused songs that sweetly reflect the simplicity of their recording. With its smooth showcasing of Frankenreiter&#39;s rich, honey-thick vocals and masterful guitar work, Start Livin&#39; bears all the intimacy of an impromptu back-porch performance and the tenderness of a treasured love letter. 

&quot;Start Livin&#39; is basically a love album,&quot; says Frankenreiter, who co-produced the record alongside Matt Grundy and Adam Ableman. &quot;Most of the songs are about my wife and our two boys, and the life that we&#39;ve built together in Hawaii.&quot; Thanks to Frankenreiter&#39;s infectious warmth and finely honed pop sensibilities, each of those songs has the singular effect of drawing the listener into that bright and breezy world for a blissed-out moment. 

Essential to the record&#39;s playful feel is Frankenreiter&#39;s inspired use of instrumentation. &quot;This album&#39;s completely unlike anything I&#39;ve ever done before, in that we skipped the basics and went for a whole lot of different instruments,&quot; he says. &quot;We never brought in a drum set&mdash;instead there&#39;s handclapping for percussion, or the two of us banging on pots and pans. We were using everything from bells to singing bowls to Zippo lighters; at one point we put some beans and salts in a can and shook it around.&quot; Grundy played a key role in the wildly varied sounds on Start Livin&#39;, according to Frankenreiter. &quot;Matt was playing ukulele and lap steel guitar and banjo&mdash;he&#39;d grab an instrument and we&#39;d do a take live and just build the track up from that. It was a real fun vibe.&quot; 

Despite that kitchen-sink approach, Start Livin&#39; never comes off as cluttered. Each of the songs shines with a crisp, clean sound perfectly suited to the album&#39;s sunny spirit: &quot;You&quot; achieves a hypnotic dreaminess by layering lap steel over beautifully crooned harmonies and a twinkling acoustic riff; &quot;I Can Lose&quot; matches its island-breezy guitars with shimmering mandolin; and a gracefully plucked banjo backs up Frankenreiter&#39;s hushed, heart-on-sleeve lyrics on the quietly epic &quot;Together Forever.&quot; On &quot;Shine,&quot; meanwhile, ocean-wave-like effects merge with a swaying melody and smitten lyrics (&quot;You and I, girl, are like a sun and moon/Lately you&#39;ve been in orbit in my head like a good summer tune&quot;). 

While love songs serve as the album&#39;s centerpiece, Frankenreiter also explores non-romantic love throughout Start Livin&#39;. The gloriously ragtag &quot;Same Lullaby,&quot; for instance, makes a sweetly hopeful plea for world peace. &quot;I wrote that song a little while after the tsunami in Japan, thinking how lucky I was to have a family and be alive,&quot; Frankenreiter recalls. &quot;The line that goes &#39;I believe the world could be fine if we could all sing the same lullaby&#39;&mdash;that&#39;s me hoping we could all just get together and be on the same wavelength even for just one moment.&quot; On the irresistibly toe-tapping &quot;Just Love,&quot; Frankenreiter turns his focus to his two sons, Ozzy and Hendrix. &quot;Sometimes my kids&#39;ll get scared of things in the dark&mdash;you know, the monster under the bed,&quot; he says. &quot;So that song&#39;s me telling them, &#39;Instead of thinking there&#39;s something bad there, think of it as just love creeping in. Embrace it. Talk to it.&#39;&quot; 

Elsewhere on Start Livin&#39;, Frankenreiter hones in on more heavy-handed matters. Undoubtedly the album&#39;s most somber moment, &quot;A.I.&quot; pays tearful tribute to Frankenreiter&#39;s friend Andy Irons (a professional surfer who passed away in November 2010). &quot;I&#39;d never been that close to someone who passed away before. The song&#39;s about me telling Andy that I just wish I could see him one more time,&quot; says Frankenreiter of &quot;A.I.,&quot; which pairs pained lyrics (&quot;Help me get through another day away from you&quot;) with gentle guitar melodies and shushing percussion. Frankenreiter also says goodbye to a friend on &quot;West Coast Fool,&quot; but this time it&#39;s a wistful takedown of &quot;a Southern man with big ol&#39; Southern plans.&quot; A high-minded twist on the typical kiss-off track, &quot;West Coast Fool&quot; pulls off the unlikely feat of seamlessly blending banjo twang with the soothing hum of a Tibetan 
singing bowl. 

For Frankenreiter, the essence of Start Livin&#39; is most fully captured in its album-opening title track. Accented by handclaps and a stick-in-your-head harmonies, &quot;Start Livin&#39;&quot; is a feel-good, uptempo call to &quot;celebrate tonight.&quot; &quot;To me the most beautiful thing about this record is it really reflects who I am today,&quot; says Frankenreiter. &quot;Start Livin&#39; means stop worrying about where you&#39;ve been, where you&#39;re going&mdash;just start embracing what you have around you. Start loving what you have right now.&quot;
