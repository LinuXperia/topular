He&#8217;s practicing, he&#8217;s scrimmaging and he&#8217;s waiting to earn a place in IU&#8217;s playing rotation.</p>
<p>His teammates are trying to get him there.</p>
<p>IU coach Tom Crean said on his weekly radio show Monday that April&#8217;s teammates are pushing him harder in practice when he&#8217;s not in the right spot or doesn&#8217;t rotate the right way.</p>
<p>Crean likes that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the players think you can help them, then they get a little bit harder on you,&#8221; Crean said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s what he needs right now. It&#8217;s just one of those situations. Is he ready for Pitt (Tuesday) night? I&#8217;m not sure about that, but we&#8217;ve got to get him ready and get him closer and closer to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>April has been mostly limited since suffering an ankle injury during the summer. He was unable to participate during Indiana&#8217;s trip to Montreal in August, and was not fully cleared to practice until a month ago.</p>
<p>April did not play in either of Indiana&#8217;s two exhibition games, but saw seven minutes on the floor during the Hoosiers&#8217; season opener against Mississippi Valley State on Nov. 14. He has not played since that game.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got to really understand what we&#8217;re doing on both sides of the ball,&#8221; Crean said. &#8220;Especially when it comes to running the offense and sprinting up into the ball screens, and the post-up game and things like that. He&#8217;s making progress.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-33192"></span><br />
— Longtime caller &#8216;Billy from Terre Haute&#8217; phoned in to ask Crean the most important question of the night. Their exchange follows:</p>
<p>&#8216;Did you get my friend request I sent you on Facebook?&#8217; Billy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have Facebook, Billy.&#8221; Crean said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Oh, you don&#8217;t?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Crean said. &#8220;I know there&#8217;s been a few fake ones. I actually am not on any social media right now at all in the last four or five weeks, or so. I haven&#8217;t been on at all. Haven&#8217;t been on Twitter, haven&#8217;t read Twitter, and I don&#8217;t have Facebook. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>— Crean touched on Hanner Mosquera-Perea&#8217;s development, saying that he has appreciated the junior&#8217;s steady progress since the end of last season.</p>
<p>Now, Crean said, Indiana needs to see Mosquera-Perea bring the intensity that he has in practice to game days. Through six games, Mosquera-Perea is averaging 8.2 points and 4.7 rebounds in 22.8 minutes per contest.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shown flashes of what he does in practice, in the games,&#8221; Crean said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s had some pretty solid games. He&#8217;s had some double-figure games, some good defensive games, but he hasn&#8217;t quite done it all that way yet. That&#8217;s from a lack of experience and a little on the awareness side. We need him to go after more balls, run the court harder and move around more in the post, especially post defense-wise. As he gets more comfortable, he&#8217;s gonna become more of a post threat for us and I think that&#8217;s gonna start pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>— Indiana has made three stops in a row only five times this season. Along with that, Crean says his freshmen are playing too many minutes because the team needs them on the floor in order to win games. The Hoosiers are not doing a good job of putting teams away when they get double-digit leads, so Crean says he needs his best players on the floor longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too many minutes, but that&#8217;s the way it is, especially in the case of Rob (Johnson), James (Blackmon Jr.) and even Yogi&#8217;s playing too many minutes for a perfect world,&#8221; Crean said. &#8220;&#8230; It&#8217;s the mental part that wears you down and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got to continue to have them build through. They don&#8217;t have that kind of resolve yet. They don&#8217;t have that resolve to understand the kind of endurance they have to have, and the mental stamina that they have to have. You can&#8217;t just come out and play. You have to take things away.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the buzzer sounded and Indiana State&#8217;s 65-61 overtime victory was complete, Teri Moren walked to the back of the IU handshake line and waited to greet the players she used to call her own.</p>
<p>She leaned forward to hug each player and staff member that passed her way, saying both hello and goodbye to a program she helped build over the previous four seasons. When it was all over, after they shared their final embrace, the Sycamores walked back toward their bench and cheered the milestone win as an announced crowd of 3,287 filed through the doors of Assembly Hall.</p>
<p>For Indiana (5-1), it was an uncharacteristic performance that reeked of poor guard play. The Hoosiers committed a season-high 22 turnovers — six by Larryn Brooks and five from reserve Alexis Gassion —and shot only 33 percent from the field. </p>
<p>Indiana&#8217;s ability to shoot consistently from 3-point range has become a staple of its first five wins on the season. On Sunday, it was largely absent, with IU connecting on only 23 percent (6-of-26) of its deep shots.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of numbers on the stat sheet are the reasons why we came up short today,&#8221; Moren said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s always lessons to be learned in losses — far more than you gain in wins sometimes. We&#8217;ve been winning by (scoring) a lot of points. We&#8217;ve yet to be in a situation where our backs are against the wall.&#8221; <span id="more-33174"></span></p>
<p>Indiana was able to get by with its mistakes and poor shooting early in the first half because ISU was plagued by many of the same issues. The teams combined for 39 turnovers, and the Sycamores matched IU&#8217;s 33 percent shooting.</p>
<p>Jasmine Greer supplied 18 points for ISU, while Amanda Cahill led Indiana with a double-double — her third of the season — of 13 points and 18 rebounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;She had a good night,&#8221; Moren said. &#8220;It was her supporting cast (that didn&#8217;t).&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hoosiers led 27-20 at halftime and boosted that advantage to as many as 10 points with six minutes left in the second half before the Sycamores answered with an 8-0 run over the next three minutes. Indiana had five turnovers over the final five minutes of regulation, including its fourth which led to a game-tying 3-pointer on the other end by Alexis Newbolt with 1:26 remaining.</p>
<p>Indiana had a chance to win it in regulation, but turned the ball over on a shot clock violation when Brooks and Tyra Buss tossed up a pair of hurried shots that missed the mark. ISU, which never led in regulation, finished the second half on a 12-2 run.</p>
<p>Gassion opened the overtime scoring with a jumper, but the Sycamores scored the next six points, including a 3-pointer by Grier that gave ISU a 62-58 lead with 1:21 left.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the backbreaker for us,&#8221; Moren said.</p>
<p>Karlee McBride cut Indiana&#8217;s deficit to one when she went off a screen and sank a 3 with 28 seconds remaining, but more misses and turnovers doomed Indiana in the waning moments.</p>
<p>Moren said she wanted to keep the focus of the day on her team, not herself. She believed the game, which was her first meeting with ISU since resigning her post as Sycamores coach to join IU in August, was overhyped, as a large and loud contingent of Indiana State fans made the trip from Terre Haute and took over the building late in the game as the Sycamore seized momentum.</p>
<p>Indiana State forced IU to adjust on the fly, and the Hoosiers couldn&#8217;t do so. The Sycamores turned it into a physical game and took away center Jenn Anderson, who scored 16 points in Indiana&#8217;s last game against East Tennessee State.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Anderson went 4-of-10 from the field for eight points.</p>
<p>Let the lessons begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really great for us to have one of these games now just to get us ready for Big Ten (season),&#8221; Brooks said. &#8220;I can tell you right now that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s gonna be every night when we get in conference play. &#8230; You never want to lose, but I think we&#8217;ll take a lot of things from it, learn from it and move on.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>FINAL OT: </strong>Indiana State 65, Indiana 61. The Hoosiers drop their first game of the season, committing 22 turnovers in the process. IU has critical turnover with 13 seconds to play, when Karlee McBride traveled as she tried to drive to the basket with the Hoosiers down 62-61. Amanda Cahill finishes with a team-high 13 points and 18 rebounds.<span id="more-33152"></span></p>
<p><strong>END REGULATION: </strong>Indiana State 54, Indiana 54. Hoosiers turned it over on a shot clock violation with eight seconds left, but Jasmine Grier&#8217;s transition 3 misses before the buzzer. Amanda Cahill&#8217;s double-double of 13 points and 17 boards paces the Hoosiers.</p>
<p><strong>1:20 2H:</strong> Indiana has a season-high 18 turnovers, the latest of which leads to a game-tying 3-pointer for Indiana State. Hoosiers had led the entire way, but not now. Tied at 54-54 with 1:20 left.</p>
<p><strong>Under-4: </strong>Indiana 52, ISU 48. Momentum swings toward the Sycamores, who are on a 6-0 run.</p>
<p><strong>Under-8: </strong>Indiana 48, ISU 39. Indiana shooting 50 percent (10-of-20) this half. Of course, many of its shots are coming from under the basket. 16 of IU&#8217;s 19 points in the paint this half.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Under-12:</strong> Indiana 40, ISU 32. Really nice game for Amanda Cahill, who has 9 points, 15 boards (5 offensive). She&#8217;s 4-of-8 from the field.</p>
<p><strong>Under-16:</strong> Indiana 33, ISU 29. Very Uncharacteristic first 25 minutes for IU, which has 11 turnovers. Season high is 16. Sycamores got as close as two points from IU&#8217;s lead on back to back drives from Rhagen Smith.</p>
<p><strong>HALF: </strong>Indiana 27, Indiana State 20. Not a good first half for Indiana, which is shooting only 29 percent (9-for-31). Coupled with eight turnovers, and it&#8217;s safe to say this is IU&#8217;s ugliest first half of the season. But the Hoosiers are on top thanks to much of the same from ISU, which is only 8-of-31 from the floor and 0-for-6. The Sycamores also have eight turnovers. Amanda Cahill has a team-high seven turnovers for Indiana, which is shooting only 4-of-13 from 3-point range.</p>
<p><strong>Under-4: </strong>Indiana 24, ISU 15. Sycamores used an 8-0 run to get within 19-15, but IU responds with five quick points of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Under-8: </strong>Indiana 19, ISU 11. Shoddy shooting for both teams, which are a combined 11-for-45 from the field. Hoosiers only 3-of-11 from 3-point range. They also have four turnovers.</p>
<p><strong>Under-12:</strong> Indiana 15, Indiana State 5. Margin could be much wider for the Hoosiers. ISU is 2-of-11 with 5 turnovers in the first 8 minutes, but Indiana isn&#8217;t shooting much better. IU only 5-for-14 from the field, with some puzzling shot selections leading to that figure.</p>
<p><strong>Under-16: </strong>Indiana 11, Indiana State 4. Brooks (6) and Buss have combined for 10 of IU&#8217;s early points.</p>
<p><strong>PREGAME:</strong> Updates to come from Indiana&#8217;s game against Indiana State. It&#8217;ll be IU coach Teri Moren&#8217;s first game against her former program. I&#8217;ll check in at the media timeouts, and you can follow along on Twitter at @MikeMillerHT.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana starters:</strong> F Amanda Cahill, C Jenn Anderson, G Tyra Buss, G Larryn Brooks, G Taylor Agler</p>

<p>In his final opportunity of the season, IU freshman quarterback Zander Diamont engineered an eight-play, 65-yard game-winning drive that ended when he high-stepped into the end zone from a yard out with 27 seconds remaining in Saturday&#8217;s 23-16 win over Purdue.</p>
<p>“It was so surreal,” Diamont said. “Those last 20 seconds they had the ball, I had my eyes closed the whole time. I was just ready to celebrate with my teammates. With everything we&#8217;ve been through this season, it means the world.”</p>
<div id="attachment_33143" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://scoop.hoosiershq.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-29-at-8.21.14-PM.png" rel="lightbox[33141]"><img src="http://scoop.hoosiershq.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-29-at-8.21.14-PM-150x150.png" alt="IU quarterback Zander Diamont poses with the Old Oaken Bucket after Saturday&#039;s win over Purdue.

(Photo taken from Diamont&#8217;s Instagram page)</i></p></div>
<p>This was the kind of ending that Diamont envisioned in the week leading into his first Old Oaken Bucket game and he made it come to fruition with a big finish. The true freshman came through in crunch time, completing five of his final seven passes in the fourth quarter for 40 yards.</p>
<p>Diamont, who started the final six games of the season after Nate Sudfeld and Chris Covington both went down with season-ending injuries, is not quite at the level of an optimal Big Ten starting quarterback, but his progression over the second half of the season bodes well for his future.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s trying not to worry about, with Sudfeld&#8217;s impending return for his final season of eligibility next fall.</p>
<p>“I’ve pushed those thoughts out of my head, for sure,” Diamont said. “The focus has been this year. The guys have come together and we’ve rallied around that thought. It’d be pointless to worry about next season. That’ll be tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Diamont finishes his first season of college football having completed 64 of his 132 passes for 515 yards, with one touchdown and four interceptions. He was at his best over his last three games, when he combined for 412 yards through the air against Rutgers, Ohio State and Purdue.</p>
<p>That development sends him into the offseason with a taste of what it takes to compete in the Big Ten, and Diamont said it&#8217;s been invaluable experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;What it&#8217;s done for my future here — and my career — it&#8217;s priceless,&#8221; Diamont said. &#8220;Getting thrown into the fire, overcoming adversity and dealing with aspects of being a starter when I maybe was supposed to redshirt or sit out. To have this moment with my teammates, with everything we&#8217;ve been through, it&#8217;s special. It mean&#8217;s a lot&#8221;</p>

<p>Tevin Coleman made sure of that on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Indiana junior finished with 130 yards on 29 carries to become the 18th player in FBS history to surpass the 2,000-yard mark. Coleman, a Doak Walker Award finalist, finishes the year with 2,036 yards, which ranks sixth in Big Ten history.</p>
<p>He ends the year first in rushing yards (2,036) and yards per carry (7.5), fourth in all-purpose yards (2,177) and rushing scores (15), sixth in total touchdowns (15) and attempts (270), and eighth in points (90) on Indiana&#8217;s single-season leaderboards.</p>
<p>Now, it’s a question of whether or not Coleman will return for his senior season. Right now, there’s no clear answer.</p>
<p>Coleman said he will sit down with IU coach Kevin Wilson in the coming weeks to determine his direction from here.</p>
<p>“What Tevin ought to do now is go through the process of finding out his draft status because this is a mature decision,” Wilson said. “The guys that don’t make it in the NFL don’t make it because they’re immature. It ain’t like the first guy out gets picked out. The deadline is January. He needs to evaluate the value of being a great college football player and the value of why Melvin Gordon comes back and Anthony Thompson. He needs to evaluate the health value of his body. There’s all kinds of things.”</p>
