Readers know it’s happening, so at the risk of losing all future business for myself, I want to shed some light on the process and how it compares to the larger entertainment industry.  <br/></p><p>When I first starting documenting daily outfits, it was purely for fun. In the process of making this site into a business, I’ve spent countless hours learning how to edit photos, write HTML code, design the layout of my site, etc. I’ve also invested in the tools, like cameras and computer equipment, to produce professional looking content.</p><p>I continue this blog because I want a place to write and showcase my projects and share my art, which as silly as it sounds, comes in the form out the way I get dressed. Producing a blog with 99% original photography and 100% original writing takes a lot of time and energy. After Adam takes my photos, I’m a one woman show! Ditto to most other bloggers. In my opinion, the quality of content on a lot of blogs is just as professional and beautiful (or even more so!) as the magazines! But where am I getting with all of this?</p><p>This site is displayed at no cost to the viewer. To justify spending so much time on blogging, it needs to make me some money from other sources. I think the majority of my readers understand this and are supportive (my survey last year showed me that over 93% of you are ok with monthly sponsorships). Writers, artists, designers, bloggers - creative people in general - all need to make money when they create things for other people to enjoy. </p><p>Now, as a point of comparison&hellip; <br/></p><!-- more --><p>Do you notice when a product has been placed in your entertainment? Not commercials or marked ads, but the actual placement on TV or in magazines? Probably not, because unlike blogs and social media, the disclosure either comes rapid fire in the teeny tiny credits at the end of the TV show or never gets openly disclosed at all. </p><p>Paid placement is EVERYWHERE! Did you see the Lego wall in the recent episode of Fixer Upper? Placed. That date night at McDonald’s on <i>The Bachelor</i>? Placement. The Coca Cola or Nike Shoes or shampoo in a movie? Placement. The “what’s in my bag” feature in magazines? Paid placement! And unless you’re looking for it, most people don’t even realize it’s an advertisement, because unlike bloggers, traditional entertainment (TV, movies, fashion magazines) doesn’t have to scream from the rooftops (or very clearly mark their posts) that there’s a behind the scenes relationship. Do you want all of your ads to be clearly labeled? As consumers, how do we define marketing versus advertising?</p><p>Bloggers are held to different standards. We must inform our readers of every gift and every relationship. We are word of mouth marketers and our recommendations are more valuable that TV commercials. We’re real people, and real endorsements hold more weight. We have a different standard to uphold - and that’s a good thing! </p><p>Here’s how I look at it with What I Wore: I treat my readers like my friends. I wouldn’t tell my girlfriends that I love a style of jeans or a brand of boots if I didn’t actually wear them. I would never want to mislead or lie to them or urge them to spend money or something subpar. I want the same honesty in my blog. I don’t separate my real self from my blog self. I am Jessica in both places! </p><p>Every time I get dressed and post photos I’m making recommendations. In a way, all of my choices are endorsements! So when a brand comes into the mix, it’s fair that readers would question - <i>does she really use that? would she buy that with her own money?</i> If I can’t say yes, it’s not a good fit. Integrity is more valuable than a big paycheck. So what happens when I find a company I love, with products I use and they want to formalize our partnership? </p><p>Here are the three ways I work directly or indirectly with brands: </p><p><i><i><b>Sponsored Posts</b></i> </i>are how I make most of my monthly income and are negotiated by the post. These can take 2-3 times more time than a normal outfit photos (back and forth with the client, product selection, photography, editing, writing, reviewing, more back and forth) Some months are reeeallly slow and some months are more busy based on the nature of consumer spending (January, June and July are light while May, Sept and December are busier). I like to keep the ratio of non sponsored to sponsored content at 10:1 or less. Contractually I can’t give you a specific dollar amount per post. I’m not a millionaire, but I do ok. </p><p><i><b>Affiliate Links</b> </i>are between $0.05 and $10 per item purchased (sometimes, very rarely, up to $40) depending on the price of the item referred. I like to make my own graphics most of the time, so the process can take up to an hour or more for each post. When I use these I’ve either purchased and used the product myself or am considering purchasing it.</p><p><i><b>Banner Ads</b></i> account for between $0.006 and $0.00025 each time you see one. That’s less than a thousandth of a cent. After the code is in place, this takes no extra time each day but is dependent on a high volume of page views which come from updating the site with new material regularly. These are labeled advertisements, not endorsements, and I work as hard as I can to make sure they make sense with my site.</p><p>None of these revenue streams are a solid bet. There’s no salary or guarantee I’ll make any money unless I work for it! When I took time off after having a baby I didn’t have a paycheck to fall back on, because self employment doesn’t come with traditional benefits. Let’s talk about those&hellip;</p><p>A lot of employees get things like health care or company cars or expense accounts. At my old job in NYC I had benefits too - free clothes, international travel, paid vacation and sick days, etc.  If you’re lucky, you might even have your maternity leave paid for (but probably less likely if you’re an American woman&hellip; I’ll rant on that another day). Point being, when you’re employed you usually have benefits. For me, it might be a surprise box with coffee pods and cookies. Or a keychain or shampoo or makeup. It’s fun and exciting to get a little gift in the mail, but I think it’s fair to acknowledge that if you’re working, you’re probably getting benefits of some kind. (Self employment does offer other perks too&hellip; these are just a few!) Anyways&hellip; back to sponsored posts! </p><p>In the eight years I’ve been writing my blog, I’ve worked with a lot of brands. I get to highlight a product or initiative and I want to be authentic when I do that. I believe it’s fair to tell you, the reader, that there’s a relationship between my blog and a brand when I write about them.  I want my posts to be honest and give you guys an insight into why I use and like those products. I also think it’s fair that I earn a living from the work I do. Clothing, beauty, home goods, baby stuff, travel and DIY challenges are all things that make sense for me. When ever the budget allows, I ask the brands if I can have an extra to give away to one of you. I want to navigate both business and blogging gracefully. </p><p>Let’s circle back to the beginning. I don&rsquo;t expect that every other person writing a blog will unveil how they run their business. I don&rsquo;t think they need to! I do think it’s great that most bloggers are so forthcoming about their relationship and disclosures, which isn’t the case for so many other kinds of entertainment. So in a way I’m writing this post because I want to give kudos to the hundreds (maybe thousands?) of bloggers that are doing it right. I have so much respect for the creative ways writers weave in partnerships on their sites. They’re honest and upfront and they also deserve to be fairly compensated for creating their content - whether it’s directly from a brand or indirectly from banners or affiliates. </p><p>I’m so grateful I can earn a living doing what I do. I genuinely love my job. The creative expression I’ve had in just the past three months alone has changed me as a person. More on that soon! I know it wouldn’t be possible without understanding readers. Or cool clients who support my creativity and point of view and sponsor those efforts. </p><p>I’m thankful to both. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/139972913138";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/139972913138";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 10:41:26 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"52 Thoughts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Honesty in Blogging";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Full Disclosure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"lovepuppy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"What I Wore | The Nineties are Alive";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3173:"<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/23+The+90s+are+Alive/90s+1.jpg" alt="Leather Moto Jacket, Polka Dot Chiffon Dress, Black Dahila Lipstick"/></p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: I often wade through thrift stores looking for pieces that have some feeling of nowness, but this dress is quite the opposite! I bought it retail because it looks like something I’d find at the thrift shop! </p><p>I have a few flowy <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/59582051289/what-i-wore-pretty-woman" target="_blank">navy and white polka dot dresses</a> and I’ve had my eyes pealed for a<a href="http://bit.ly/1QVjzkt" target="_blank"> black and white number</a> for a long time. When I saw this dress at ModCloth (and had a store credit to burn!) I scooped it up immediately. It’s a four season kind of dress, but when it arrived, we had a fresh dusting of snow and I was more in the mood to layer up. We’ve had a dose of springlike weather these past few days, so here I am! bare legs and booties with a chiffon dress.</p><p>I’m also sort of channeling a gal who works at my local coffee shop. She oozes cool with the blink of an eye and effortlessly so. I can’t say the same for myself. My look has an air of effort, and I’m ok with that. Mama only gets a chance to get out of the house alone a handful of times each week, so damn right I’m going to try! </p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: I am one of those moms that loves to<a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/128029767788/what-i-wore-birthday" target="_blank"> coordinate clothing with her kid</a>. Sometimes I will take it as far to totally match (like these <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/125988552704/what-i-wore-capture-the-flag" target="_blank">Indiana flag tees</a> or <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/131154051358/what-i-wore-sky-high" target="_blank">cream sweaters</a>). Most of the time it&rsquo;s intentional, but on a lot of days it’s just what’s clean on the top of the pile for both of us. Also, it’s darling! </p><p>What makes me sad about kids clothes is how fast they grow out of them! Luckily we’re moving into spring as Felix jumps up to the next size (2T in pants, thanks to the cloth diapers) and between 18-24 months/2T in tops) so the timing is right for new duds. When he was born he was given so many outfits as gifts so I really enjoy the chance to shop for him now. And I’ve said this before but before having a boy I didn’t anticipate how much fun it would be to pick out his outfits each day! There are so many cute things out there for both lil girls <i>and</i> lil boys.</p><p>Since he’s only going to fit into a given size for a short period of time, I like to make sure it all matches back to his other pieces (hello baby capsule wardrobe!) I also like choosing graphic tees with things that he&rsquo;s shown an interest in, like outer space (always pointing to the moon!) and wolves (in his favorite bedtime story books). Here’s how I normally break things down for his clothes each time he moves into a new size (click on any image to shop). </p>

<p><b>When</b>: February 20, 2016</p><p><b>What</b>:<br/>Shades: Karen Walker ‘Super Duper’ in crazy tort<br/>Jacket: Denim + Supply, gift from 2011<br/>Overalls: <a href="http://bit.ly/1oVmS4u" target="_blank">Old Navy</a>, via giftcard<br/>Booties: LL Bean Signature<br/><br/></p><p><b>On Felix</b>:<br/><a href="http://bit.ly/1LB5xCC" target="_blank">Baseball Tee</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1VxrMz6" target="_blank">Jeans</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/21j0ekn" target="_blank">High Top Sneakers</a>: Old Navy via giftcard</p><p><b>Where</b>: All Over Town! It was over 70 degrees!!</p><p>I only ended up wearing my jacket on my way to brunch because in the sun it wasn’t necessary. This is my first time wearing overalls since&hellip; 7th grade? I’ve been wanting to try them for a long time (seeing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joannagaines/" target="_blank">Jo Jo in a pair on her instagram</a> was the push I needed to put some on), so these were on sale and worth the experiment! <br/></p><p>I’ll be honest - I felt really self conscious in them as I started the day!  Unlike the fitted waist of a full skirt, this piece isn’t meant to be feminine. But that made me feel so free! I really rocked these more and more each time I left the house. I felt <i>really</i> confident. And cool. I’m really glad I picked them up. I have a <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/tagged/52%20thoughts" target="_blank">52 thoughts</a> post that’s semi related to this that I hope to complete this week, but when clothing makes you realize something about yourself on a deeper level (yes! it’s possible!), it’s a really amazing feeling.
Now&hellip;I’ll leave you with more photos of me and my darling boy!</p>

A few weeks ago I did four dozen using spirits from my <a href="http://cardinalspirits.com" target="_blank">husband’s distillery</a> for a party they held (see photos with details <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBa3Y8qqq9K/?taken-by=whatiwore" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBa29j6qq8P/?taken-by=whatiwore" target="_blank">here</a>) and then I did <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBfSx8nqq_a/?taken-by=whatiwore" target="_blank">red velvet cupcakes</a> for the Super Bowl. </p><p>Today I’m sharing a recipe I’ve been tweaking for the past couple of weeks - Mint Chocolate Cupcakes! I think the key is in the kind of mint you use and how much&hellip; read on for details!</p><p><!-- more --></p><h2>Chocolate Mint Cakes </h2><p><i>Yields 16</i></p><ul><li>3 T butter, softened<br/></li><li>2 eggs<br/></li><li>1 C, 2T sugar<br/></li><li>1 C flour<br/></li><li>&frac12; C unsweetened cocoa<br/></li><li>1 &frac12; t baking powder<br/></li><li>1/8 t baking soda<br/></li><li>&frac34; C milk<br/></li><li>&frac12; t vanilla extract<br/></li><li>1 drop peppermint extract<br/></li><li>1 drop spearmint oil<br/></li></ul><p>Preheat your over to 350 and line your cupcake tin with parchment liners.</p><p>Cream together soft butter and sugar in a mixer until combined.  Add one egg at a time and mix thoroughly.</p><p>In another bowl, sift together remaining dry ingredients.</p><p>Add vanilla, spearmint and peppermint to milk.</p><p>Alternate adding dry and wet ingredients to batter, making sure to fully combine. </p><p>Give it a good whip on high. Fill liners about half way to &frac34; full using an ice cream scoop (this was a tool that really upped my game!)</p><p>Bake 17 minutes and check with a toothpick to ensure center is baked through (a clean toothpick means they are ready to come out!)</p><p>While they are cooling, prep your icing!</p><h2>Mint Cream Cheese Icing with Oreos</h2><p>This is my favorite icing base and I use it for every kind of flavor I do! Be VERY careful adding the mint extract and oil&hellip; the smallest amount goes a very long way and gives a wonderful nuance to the flavor. Too much and it tastes like toothpaste!</p><p><i>Yields enough to frost 16-20 cupcakes</i></p><ul><li>6 oz cream cheese, softed<br/></li><li>6 oz butter, softened<br/></li><li>2 C powdered sugar<br/></li><li>2 drops green food coloring<br/></li><li>1 drop blue food coloring<br/></li><li>1 drop spearmint oil*<br/></li><li>1 drop peppermint extract*<br/></li><li>2 Oreo Cookies, smashed<br/></li></ul><p>Cream together softened cream cheese and butter until fully combined and fluffy. </p><p>Slowly add powdered sugar in &frac12; C increments.</p><p>Add food coloring and mix until pigment is combined.</p><p>*Now for the mint. Using a spoon, drip one drop of each flavor and let it roll off the spoon. Stir the icing with that spoon and remix to incorporate flavor. Taste your icing and repeat if necessary. </p><p>When flavor is to your liking, fold in crumbled Oreo cookies, leaving enough crumbs to garnish your frosted cupcakes.</p><p>Once cupcakes have completely cooled, use a large star tip (<a href="http://bit.ly/24a2Pja" target="_blank">Wilton 1M</a> shown here) to ice and top with crumbled cookies. </p>

I am going on Spring Break for the first time in my life this year! In grade and high school we never did a family trips during the school year and in college I was broke as a joke and my parents were not about to finance a booze cruise for me. But that’s alright&hellip; this year I am really looking forward to our extended family trip to Florida.</p><p>I like to pick a theme when I go on vacation. For our anniversary <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/137534193874/we-went-to-belize" target="_blank">trip to Belize</a> I picked out a few swimsuits that had an Aztec kind of vibe. Neon bohemian? For Florida I have plans (and fabric!) to make some 50s style dresses and I bought some retro style sunglasses. So I’m thinking I might grab a new vintage inspired swimsuit too. I tried on some of my retro styles from years past before our last trip and they still didn&rsquo;t fit in the bosom, but if they do, I probably won&rsquo;t get anything new. BUT! If I do, I really like these options! I don’t like for my lower stomach to be exposed (except for when I was pregnant! weird!) so I’ve sought out one pieces or high rise bottoms. <a href="http://facebook.com/whatiworeofficial" target="_blank">Help me choose!</a> </p><p><i>Above: <a href="http://bit.ly/247Lyam" target="_blank">Blue and Purple One Piece</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Qj3MkY" target="_blank">Pink and Black One Piece</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/216GO22" target="_blank">Green and Black Two Piece</a>  Below: <a href="http://jcrew.com" target="_blank">Polka Dot Two Piece</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/216H558" target="_blank">Orange Blue and Purple Two Piece</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/20Bx4Le" target="_blank">Yellow and Pink Two Piece</a>. </i></p>

<p>I am finally back to getting a good night’s sleep! And by good I mean 8-9 hours a night! We’ve been working for a couple months on getting Felix to sleep in his crib and through the night. Before I go into any of this, let me just make a blanket statement - <i>you are the expert on your own child</i>. What worked for us might not work for you and our parenting decisions might be different.  We’re all doing our best to raise happy and healthy kiddos and there are many ways to do that! Now&hellip; let’s talk zzzzzs! </p>
<p><!-- more --></p><h2>Co-Sleeping</h2><p>When we brought Felix home from the hospital, I knew we would all sleep together in the same bed. We created a safe environment with minimal bedding and pillows. Adam and I had our own twin sized sheets and blankets (we have a king) so the chances of pulling the covers up and over our son’s head were unlikely.  We also had a little nest like contraption with firm sides so we wouldn’t accidentally roll over on our tiny newborn. He was a loud sleeper, so we tried other things as well - a vibrating bassinet type thing in our room - and then in his room - and finally back to our bed. The determining factor to co-sleep without the nest was my quality of sleep. Getting up to nurse in a rocking chair every two or three hours in another room was turning me into a very very unhappy person. Sleep deprivation is torture!</p><p>At seven weeks old Felix started sleeping in my arms and I would nurse him on my side without sitting up. That made an HUGE difference for me. I still woke up and nursed on demand, but I wasn’t fully interrupting my sleep cycles and was able to fall back asleep more quickly. YES! </p><p>Once Felix was more mobile and crawling, we dropped our mattress to the floor and moved out our bedside tables and lamps because cords are no bueno around babies. </p><p>Co-sleeping really worked for me and for our family. Not only did I get better sleep, but I had better piece of mind.  As a new mom I would wake up often just to check his breathing and with him snuggled in my arms, it was easy to check! Bed sharing is the cultural normal in other parts of the world, especially those countries where breastfeeding rates are higher.  If you choose this option for your family, do your homework. I’m not advocating it for everyone, but it absolutely worked for us.  Ok, back to sleep training! </p><h2>Timeline</h2><ul><li>Birth - 7 Weeks: Co-Sleeping (with <a href="http://bit.ly/1KbKImd" target="_blank">this</a>)<br/></li><li>7 Weeks - 14 Months: Co-Sleeping<br/></li><li>14 Months: Began transition to crib for first sleep cycle<br/></li><li>15 Months: Complete transition</li></ul><h2>Sleep Training</h2><p>Fast forward another year. At 14 months old, we decided to transition Felix to the crib. Although I did feel like I was getting enough sleep to function, it was really choppy. I was ready to snooze the whole night through, but we really dragged our heels at getting started. It was so easy to just crawl into bed together and the new routine took way more work! We picked a start date (Nov 1) to give ourselves a good block of time before traveling again. </p><p>Before putting him down, we established a routine - dinner, bath time, a baby massage, diaper and jammies -  at the same time every night. Now he usually goes down by 6:30 and sleeps as late as 7am (but wake ups vary from 5-7). After dinner we ask him if he wants “tubby” and he says “yeah!” and walks towards the stairs. It’s a nice and calm part of the day as we all wind down. <br/></p><p>We started our transition by getting Felix to sleep in his crib for the first portion of the night (four to six hours). This gave Adam and me a chance to eat dinner together, watch a little TV and hang out alone. When Felix would wake up we’d all pile into the family bed and I’d nurse him back to sleep and then we’d watch a movie before tuning in.</p><p>Before Felix was born, I researched a lot of &ldquo;gentle&rdquo; no cry methods for getting a baby to sleep, but when push came to shove, I decided to let him self soothe&hellip; and it worked! I had serious doubts on the concept, especially for a lil baby, but Felix was already a toddler at this point. In the end I took the advice of three of my friends that I think are really amazing mothers (and different kinds of moms at that). They warned me the first few nights would be hard, but if you stuck it out, it wouldn’t last long. <i>They were right!</i> I will absolutely do this with my next child around the same age too. The first night I nursed Felix to sleep in his room, and put him into the crib. He woke as I laid him down and started throwing a fit. I told him I loved him and closed the door. He cried for an hour before falling asleep on his own. Yes, it was hard on me. Yes, I wanted to hold him and rock him to sleep, but I made myself busy in a different part of the house so I couldn’t hear him. And weirdly, this kid wouldn’t lay down, so he’d be sleeping sitting up in the corner!! The next night he cried for 20 minutes, followed by 5, and then 1 minute and would eventually just reaching for his mattress. </p><p>Another thing that helped us was to put a hand on the back of his head and on his back and gently pat him to sleep once he was laying down. This helped him fully relax and we could slowly back out of the room.</p><p>Speaking of the room - let’s talk about that for a moment. We use a <a href="http://bit.ly/1LgXefa" target="_blank">sound machine</a> and draw the curtains so it’s pretty dark in there. We have really creaky old floors so the white noise helps us get out of the room without being detected (most of the time!)</p><p>I was kind of afraid he’d be mad at me for putting him in his crib and letting him cry, but he actually woke up a happy baby and well rested. And I was well rested and a happy mom!</p><p>After a month of going down in his own room for a few hours we decided to go for the entire night. In his crib we knew he was safe and we used a video monitor to check in on him, but we let him cry for a few minutes when he’d wake up between sleep cycles. We also used ear plugs for the off duty parent so someone would be alert enough to get up if necessary. Moving him out of our bed allowed me to night wean him which was a smart first step in the overall weaning process. Mommy was a 24/7 all you can eat buffet and I was tired of it! </p><p>In just a few nights he’d sleep all the way through. It was more about us committing to not getting up than him being able to do it. When he’d see us in the middle of the night he’d have a much harder time falling back to sleep than when he’d self soothe. The key really is to <i>just let your child be </i>as long as he’s safe and not in need of immediate attention.</p><p>Within two months of leaving a full night in our bed, Felix was sleeping a full night in his crib. And by full I mean 11 or 12 hours! What a huge change in my quality of life. I’m not kidding! Now Adam and I alternate morning wake ups so the other can get an extra hour of sleep and all three of us are so happy. </p><h2>Where We Are Now</h2><p>Felix has been sleeping in his crib all night for two and a half months. He’s still ended up with us on a few occasions - while traveling or when he needs extra snuggles (like the other night when he was cutting a tooth!). </p><p>Once we had completely weaned, Adam took over the bath and bed time routine - something he really loves as a way to bond with Felix. It’s great! When 6 o’clock rolls around I’m off parent duty for the night! They have their own set of rituals and it makes me happy to see Felix so well adjusted. <br/></p><p>I am really glad we finally made the decision to move from co-sleeping to his crib.  We did this whole transition out of necessity and it fell over the holidays, which I actually wouldn’t recommend. Instead find a block of time (two months?) so you can develop a consistent routine.</p><p>We’ll definitely co-sleep when we have another baby - I loved it so much. But I also love sleeping on my stomach again like a starfish! </p><p>I’m not an expert, but I’m happy to answer questions on my <a href="http://facebook.com/whatiworeofficial" target="_blank">facebook page</a> if you have them! Good luck with your own babies and your night time routines! </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/139407277868";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/139407277868";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 01:00:18 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"MoM";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Motherhood";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Musings on Motherhood";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Parenting";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Sleep Training";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Co-Sleeping";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"lovepuppy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"What I Wore | Pretty Happy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2166:"<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/11+Pretty+Happy/Pretty+Happy+1.jpg" alt="Icelandic Lopy, Winter Outfit"/></p>

It’s freezing! Actually, it’s below freezing and was 18 degrees when we took these photos. I bundled up with my Icelandic sweater I bought on my honeymoon, layered over another turtleneck with jeans, boots and a wool coat. Nothing in this outfit is super new - I’ve had each piece for a few years minus the boots. I know I’ve said this more than once in the past few weeks, but I feel so good just wearing what strikes me, regardless if it’s new or old, flashy or simple, glamourous or basic. My confidence is growing and the inspiration I’m feeling in my wardrobe is overflowing into other areas of my life as well. This morning when Adam took these photos he said “Jess, you look pretty and happy today!” And I am! </p>

I love looking back at family albums and my elementary, middle and high school pictures. Professional photos only happened once a year! Everything was on film! And they only took one or two shots! Above you can see my senior portrait next to a photo of me and Felix from last summer. </p>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/Beauty+Basics+Then+and+Now/Jessica+5th+grade.jpg" alt="image" style="float: left;"/><p>I used to plan for these big photo shoots extensively. I’d usually sleep in curlers (the pink sponge rollers) and when I was in fifth grade, I finally got to do “makeup” for my photos. It was the first time I was allowed to wear it to school (dance recitals were the only time I&rsquo;d worn makeup before then). My beauty routine it was a very soft blush, clear mascara and Vaseline for lipgloss. I vividly remember looking in the tiny mirror in my locker before this photo was taken and practicing my best smile. I wore a maroon faux suede long skirt and matching cami (homemade) with a cream lace top, a black beret and a cross on a velvet choker. I felt stylish and beautiful and grown up! </p><br/><p>In middle school my mom took me to Target to get my “kit” of stuff that I’d need as a teenager.   I got my first razor, a stick of deodorant, some zit cream, a new toothbrush and my own tube of toothpaste. We also bought a little plastic container for my drawer (in the small bathroom I shared with my little brother and sister.) On my own I bought my first set of tweezers and makeup brushes and went to town on over plucking my eyebrows, as evidenced in these photos. To give myself a little credit, that scar is a little tricky to work around and thin brows were the <i>thing </i>in the late 90s!  </p>

I was on the cross country and track teams so I spent a lot of time outside. I also rocked pale purple eye shadow and still went with a clear lip gloss. I spent a lot of time on my foundation makeup -  I had pretty bad skin so I’d use a paintbrush to carefully apply my concealer. Now that I see these photos again, I think to myself - <i>what a pretty girl</i>, but like a lot of teenagers, I had terrible self esteem. I wish I could have been kinder to myself back then.<br/><br/><p>I obviously don’t have the same beauty routine as I did in fifth grade or even high school. I’ve added SPF, BB cream, liquid eye liner and I fill in my eyebrows. I’ve experimented with a huge range of products. But the basics are still the same. I curl my lashes, I use mascara and blush and I still dab a little something on my lips. Some days it’s a bright lipstick, but most days it’s something to keep them from getting chapped and dry. </p><br/><p>For the past couple weeks I’ve been trying out Vaseline Lip Therapy Tins. When they brought the idea to me, I immediately thought back to that school picture day in the beret and choker. Not to completely date myself, but it was over twenty years ago when I first used Vaseline on my lips, so of course I want try the different varieties now (Original, Aloe, Cocoa Butter and Rosy Lips). The tins have been popular in the UK and finally available stateside at <a href="http://target.com" target="_blank">Target</a> stores (for under four bucks a pop). My favorite is the Rosy Lips for the delicious smell! I also like packaging that looks retro and when I’ve gone through all of the product inside, I think it would be a great vessel for little bits and bobs in my purse. </p><br/><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/Beauty+Basics+Then+and+Now/Vaseline+Lip+Therapy+Lip+Tins.jpg" alt="image"/></p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: Each week I get about 10 hours to work outside of the house. It’s the main time I  devote to the blog - the writing, editing photos and answering emails. Last week both of my sitters fell through on Wednesday and Thursday so it’s been a while since I’ve been able to get out of the house alone! This outfit came together in a rush - I had on my tights when the babysitter knocked on the door so I just had to throw something on. I haven’t worn this dress in way too long so I pretty much copied <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/69695901209/what-i-wore-cold-snap" target="_blank">this outfit</a> exactly and off I went! </p>

If you’ve thought of picking one up, now is the time to keep an eye on sales as merchants make room for their spring merchandise. Here are quite a few cute ones under $200 at <a href="http://bit.ly/1PiMTTT" target="_blank">Nordstrom Rack</a>. It’s a timeless piece that can give our pretty dresses a bit of an edge or can easily be worn with jeans! If you’re buying online, READ THE REVIEWS, especially with investment pieces (and double check the return policy, you never want to be stuck with something that gathers dust and doesn’t get worn!)</p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: One of my favorite pops of color in winter (and year round) is cobalt. I only have a few pieces - a giant infinity scarf and a cobalt handbag, but they work beautifully with a lot of different other colors and patterns. Above I’ve pulled some pairings I really like from my archive - stripes, prints, with pale pink and mint green. </p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: I love a winter snow day. Not a blizzard or a power outage, but a good old fashion snow day. We actually took these pictures last time it snowed and I just now got around to editing them. I&rsquo;m wearing a lot of my casual winter favorites - a hand knit hat, a thick wool peacoat and my trusty cream sweater. Practical and pulled together for an average every day.</p>

<p>It’s February and honestly, it’s a such blah month, which is why I think Valentine’s Day became so popular. Also, Hallmark. I could do a gift guide right about now, but didn’t we just have Christmas? Our little wish lists have been fulfilled for the next year or longer! </p><p>Simple thoughtful gestures or breaks in the normal routine are good for relationships. We get up, go to work, raise the children, make dinner and go to bed. The days, weeks and months can blur together. So thank goodness for a sappy day on the calendar to snap out of it, celebrate or get romantic with the people we care about. </p><p>Here are a few ideas to spread a little love instead of spending on ‘spency gifts. Some of them are a bit more effort and some of them don’t seem like a big deal at all. But if you put all of the dishes in the dishwasher when she’s not looking, she <i>will</i> notice.</p><p>Here are a few more&hellip;</p><ol><li>Get up early and surprise him or her with donuts<br/></li><li>Compliment something mundane that you notice about your partner, but never mention out loud.<br/></li><li>Go out for a cup of coffee (if you usually make it at home)<br/></li><li>Or brew a pot at home<br/></li><li>Get his car washed and fill up the tank.<br/></li><li>Do her share of chores for the day<br/></li><li>Or take over the early wake up times with the kids<br/></li><li>Ditch your phone for the day<br/></li><li>Hand over the remote<br/></li><li>Snuggle up on the same couch.<br/></li><li>And watch something together, even if it’s not your usual choice&hellip;<br/></li><li>While holding hands<br/></li><li>Draw him or her a bath, make their favorite drink and get out of the way<br/></li><li>Hide post it love notes in random places&hellip;<br/></li><li>Like in the fridge <br/></li><li>Or the diaper drawer <br/></li><li>Or on her steering wheel <br/></li><li>Or in the record player <br/></li><li>Do a thirty second hug instead of a quick squeeze<br/></li><li>Sit down with a pile of old magazines and make home made Valentine’s cards together<br/></li></ol><p>Do you have any fun traditions or other ideas you&rsquo;d like to share?

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: Tell you what guys, I’m feeling so creative and free when getting dressed these days! In most of my outfits these days I aim to do something vintage, something homemade and something I’ve had in my closet but not worn recently. This look is a good example of that! Let’s break it down:</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p><b>When</b>: February 3, 2016</p><p><b>What:</b><br/>Shades: <a href="http://rstyle.me/n/2jic9cpee" target="_blank">Karen Walker</a><br/>Cape: <a href="http://bit.ly/20H8331" target="_blank">mikasasucasa on etsy</a><br/>Sweater: Self Made (<a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/130042707910/my-diy-hand-knit-striped-sweater" target="_blank">pattern info here</a>)<br/>Jeans: <a href="http://rstyle.me/n/63gxacpee" target="_blank">Frame Denim</a> (on sale for $92!!)<br/>Scarf: Vintage<br/>Bag: Souvenir from Hong Kong (10 or so years ago!)<br/>Boots: Frye</p><p><b>Where</b>: All dressed to go work at the coffee shop and then my sitter called in sick, so off to the grocery with Felix instead (but not before getting OOTD pics!)</p><p>Alright, so following my little formula, the vintage piece is the camel cape I bought from one of my favorite bloggers/vintage dealers on etsy (link above). It took me a while to figure out proportions that I liked and eventually realized a nice flare cut would balance things out (the jeans were purchased last fall). The self made element is the sweater I knit myself. Finally, the scarf and bag are oldies from when I first started doing outfit photos in 2007. I love pulling together all different kinds of pieces this way. Not too vintagey, not entirely new (although, that is a fun treat once or twice a season) and not things I’ve worn so much I’ve grown tired of them. I did a similar color combo last fall <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/131554347073/what-i-wore-parisienne" target="_blank">HERE</a>. </p><p>I was just scanning my really old WIW photos and can’t wait to re-invent some of those outfits in the weeks to come.

I’ve chosen my key issues and researched what the top candidates in both parties have to say.</p><p><i>I urge you, woman to woman, please vote.</i> Our gender had to fight very hard to be seen as real people, capable of making informed decisions, and not to let our fathers and husbands speak for us. <i>That was less than 100 years ago</i>. It’s easy to look at the big political machine and throw your hands into the air because there’s a lot of BS floating around.  But your vote matters, even if you’re in a “Red” or “Blue” state that you think could never go the other direction. It’s happened. It happened in Indiana 8 years ago. </p><p>I’m looking for candidates to address the following issues: gun control, health care (specifically for women and children), marriage equality, the environment, and education. Please research issues that are important to you. I’d like to minimize any bias, so I’ve gone directly to the candidate’s official websites and copied and pasted their exact words. It&rsquo;s time to stop trusting the biased media and find the answers for yourself!</p>
<p>Some candidates did not address these issues on their websites, so in those cases, I have listed their stance as <i>not readily available</i>. Four out of five of the candidates did NOT have a search feature on their sites. If you see something that I missed, shoot me a link and I’ll be happy to update accordingly.</p>
<p><i><b>UPDATE</b>: This post is comprised of answers that the candidates campaign websites supplied. When something is missing, WHY? Shouldn&rsquo;t this information be easy to find in one place (especially the place the candidate has created to share their views in their own words?) The positions should be on campaign websites and presented in a way that doesn&rsquo;t confuse voters. It&rsquo;s not always like that, which is worth noting.</i></p>
<p>Let’s briefly meet our candidates and hear their campaign slogans! Click through to visit their official websites.</p>

Writing this post was so eye opening - as in, it really scared me to think some of these people could be elected!  If you also care about the above issues, I really urge you to dig deeper and read more about the person you believe is best to be the President of the United States. Do not stand by and let history happen without being a part of it. Read the websites, get informed, VOTE!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/138653270135";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/138653270135";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 04 Feb 2016 01:00:03 -0500";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:11:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Election";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Election 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Vote";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Voting";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"presidency";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"hillary clinton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Bernie Sanders";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Ted Cruz";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Marco Rubio";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:9;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Donald Trump";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:10;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"52 Thoughts";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"lovepuppy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"What I Wore | Olive Green Jacket";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3514:"<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/03+Olive+Green+Jacket/Olive+Green+Jacket+2.jpg" alt="Olive Green Jacket"/></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/03+Olive+Green+Jacket/Olive+Green+Jacket+5.JPG" alt="Olive Green Jacket"/></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/03+Olive+Green+Jacket/Olive+Green+Jacket+3.jpg" alt="Olive Green Jacket"/></p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/03+Olive+Green+Jacket/Olive+Green+Jacket+4.jpg" alt="Olive Green Jacket"/></p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2015/01+January/05+Out+With+the+Old/Shop+The+Look.jpg" alt=""/>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: Ever have those mornings where you’re having fun getting dressed for the first couple outfit changes and then you’re like <i>to hell with it! I just need to get out the door! </i>This is what that looks like on me. I kept going back and forth between jeans and tights and layering over my turtleneck and finally I ran back upstairs and threw this on. Trusty olive green jacket to the rescue!</p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: Recognize this dress? It’s one of my long time favorite vintage pieces! It’s nothing high quality or designer or anything - just a dress that has become a classic in my closet. I originally chopped off a foot or so of length from the hem and I’ve worn it for all seasons. It was actually the photos I linked to in my <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/138199962539/what-im-watching-younger" target="_blank">Younger</a> post that reminded me of wearing it with boots, tights and layered over a turtleneck. </p><p><!-- more --></p>

When I wrote about <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/137779656058/52-thoughts-an-occasional-style-blogger" target="_blank">how fashion bloggers have lost touch</a>, it meant different things to different people. Some women think <i>I’d never wear lipstick that dark on a Thursday morning</i>! Others might look at a fashion blog and think of the ways she could spend $2000 better than on a handbag. For me, being realistic is photographing the outfit I’m <i>actually</i> wearing on any given day. It’s being true to my creative intuition, which might mean bold lipstick or crazy pattern mixing. It’s wearing the same basic piece more than once a week or wearing a favorite flashier piece just as often. Sometimes I’m going to splurge on something that’s more pricey - and for me, it’s a very real possibility that I’ll buy another nice pair or jeans or a designer bag or fancy lipstick.  Realistic is different for everyone and this is what realistic looks like to me. </p>

It’s a topic I’m passionate about and my aim with this post is to share my experience and offer support and resources for women that might not have them at their disposal within their own families or communities. I want to be a part of normalizing a very natural thing! </p><p>How a mother feeds her child can bring up a lot of emotions - it’s a complicated issue! I believe that it’s possible to be supportive of all methods of feeding - whether you choose the route or the route is chosen for you. So if you’re an exclusive breastfeeder for 1 day or 1 year or you use bottles and formula or donor milk or any combination in between, mother to mother, <b>I support you</b>. Being a new mom is the hardest job on the planet and the last thing she needs is anyone’s judgment for doing what works best for her and her baby.</p><p><i>If for some reason you’re not into boobs or babies, I won’t be offended if you skip this post! There will be photos of a real, live human child (Felix) on a real life human breast (Mine!) so you’ve been warned! </i>

<h2>Initial Hurdles</h2><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/01+Breastfeeding/Christmas+Boobie.jpg" alt="Musings on Motherhood | Breastfeeding and Weaning"/><p>I made an initial plan to nurse for six weeks and then re-evaluate. Breastfeeding does not come easily to most women - including me. Our first days were a big struggle and we used donor milk from our hospital while staying there and bought another 100 ounces home with us. I had a cesarean birth and my milk supply took a little longer than normal to come in, which isn’t unusual with that type of delivery. Felix did latch on and nurse when I was first able to hold him and some blood work showed us he was getting a little colostrum. Later while I was recovering in the hospital and my baby cried for more, patient nurses helped express milk (or colostrum) into a spoon and then feed it to Felix. As happy as I was with a healthy child, I was also grieving the C-section and was hell bent on making nursing work! </p><p>For the donor milk we rigged up a supplimental nursing system and a nipple shield so it <i>felt</i> like I was nursing. I was pumping regularly (using an amazing Medela Symphony we rented from the hospital) and within five days I had enough supply to feed the baby and discontinue donor milk. That was a big deal for us! </p><p>Felix’s latch still wasn’t great and I used a shield for at least the first six weeks. You hear women say nursing “shouldn’t feel like anything” and eventually - yeah! - but at first it’s not pleasant! And those cluster feeding seasons can do a number on your sensitive breasts! </p>

<h2>Major Complications</h2>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/01+Breastfeeding/Boobie+Nap+1.jpg" alt="Musings on Motherhood | Breastfeeding and Weaning"/><p>Around that six week point was when we moved towards latching without the shield but by week eight we were in big trouble. I wrote a couple posts about it (<a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/101842683018/the-angry-boob" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/109878886748/angry-boob-an-update" target="_blank">here</a>) but long story short, I had a plugged duct, then asymptomatic mastitis, an abscess and an incision and drainage surgery. I toyed with the idea of weaning (and my surgeon recommended it eventually) but something in the core of my being would not quit. My milky wound leaked breastmilk 24/7 for weeks. Instead of a bandage I used overnight pads and had to change them every few hours, including waking up in the middle of the night. I weaned down to two sessions on that breast and the other side took up all the slack. Eventually the drain came out, the wound closed up and we got back to business on my left boob. </p>

<h2>Our Nursing Timeline</h2>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/01+Breastfeeding/Favorte+Breastfeeding+Picture+Ever.jpg" alt="Musings on Motherhood | Breastfeeding and Weaning"/><p>And then&hellip; we just nursed! Because I am home with Felix most of the time, I’d just nurse on demand. I did keep pumping here and there (more frequently when I was teaching a course at IU and was gone for 4 hours two days a week) but discontinued that at 7 months. Honestly, it’s a pain in the ass. I’d rather just cuddle up and do a boobie nap than put Felix down and drag out the pump. Pumping mothers, I salute you! </p><p>The rest of the timeline went like this:</p><ul><li>Five Months: Introduced solid foods<br/></li><li>14 Months: Begin Night Weaning<br/></li><li>15 Months: Night Weaned<br/></li><li>16 Months, One Week: Completely Weaned<br/></li></ul><h2>Support and Resources</h2><p>I don’t think I would have continued to nurse as long if it weren’t for the supportive folks around me. I nursed in my home without a nursing cover in front of my family, and they never made me feel like I had to leave the room or at all uncomfortable. Thank you family! The Bloomington community is very accepting of breastfeeding and there was never a time in public I ever felt ashamed or embarrassed. I’ve always had a go to response ready if someone ever confronted me (”It is my legal right to breastfeed my child in public in the state of Indiana.” Then smile.) I also skipped any sort of nursing cover ups both at home and in public. I found the two tee layering method (a v-neck under another top) was modest and discreet! I’m sure people had no idea I was nursing at all some of the time! Thank you B-Town!</p><p>My local professionals, Anne Marie Neely, IBLCE and Mary Ann Martin, INLCE were a huge help - offering free advice to all women formerly through BABS and now through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/milkmattersbloomington/" target="_blank"> Milk Matters: A Drop in Gathering for Mothers and Babies</a>. Thank you both for your invaluable encouragement and advice! </p><p>Online, my best resource was the site <a href="http://kellymom.com/" target="_blank">KellyMom.com</a>, which I checked dozens of times. </p>

<h2>Weaning</h2>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.whatiworeblog.com/2016/02+February/01+Breastfeeding/Weaned!.jpg" alt="Musings on Motherhood | Breastfeeding and Weaning"/><p>Our first step was to increase Felix’s calories through solid foods and cow’s milk. This helped him stay full through the night and that was how we made our first long stretches between his meals. It definitely took a while and I still nursed him 24/7 until he was 15 months old. </p><p>Felix didn’t really like milk at first and I can understand why! Breast milk is delicious, warm and custom made for your baby. We also didn’t do a lot of bottles between 6-12 months and that probably added to the problem. In the end we found that the <a href="http://bit.ly/1nWUkHv" target="_blank">Philips Avent Training Cup</a> with a rubber sippy cup style top worked best for Felix. Trial and error on that one! </p><p>As he became more accustomed to cows milk and was eating bigger solid meals, I’d drop a nursing session here and there. I kept on with his nap and bedtime feedings without fail but could get through the morning and late afternoon without nursing. It’s hard when the boobie solves everything. Nursing can be a lifesaver in a lot of situations. Whining in public: <i>boobie</i>. Falls and starts crying: <i>boobie</i>. Mommy exhausted and wants to watch a nap and Fixer Upper on demand: <i>boobie</i>. </p><p>The other factor influencing my weaning schedule was an 8 day vacation in January. Honestly, if I didn&rsquo;t have a solid stop time, I would have kept going. And truth time - I did nurse him one day after I got back from my trip&hellip; and even 8 days later my milk still came in! The human body is an amazing thing. Then I remembered how great I felt once weaned, so we did the sign for “all gone” and said that to him when he’d cry “BEEEEEEE”</p><p>Now we’ve gone over two weeks and I can confidently say we’re done. I was ready and I think Felix is ok with it. Old habits die hard and it would be way easier to do nap time with boobie, but we’re forging onwards.</p>
<h2>Other Issues</h2><p>My concern when weaning was getting a plugged duct, mastitis or becoming really engorged again but none of those things happened. Going gradually was a good idea for us. What did knock me off my chair was the hormonal disruption. Just reducing our nursing schedule by one session a day seemed to have an effect on my mood. Now a few weeks later I’ve also been feeling a little sad, which I’m attributing to the reduction in oxytocin (love hormones!) from breastfeeding. </p><p>So that’s my breastfeeding story! I’m so proud of nursing my son to 16 months despite the hardships. If you’re at all considering breastfeeding - I hope you do it and find local support to give yourself the best shot possible. And I want to repeat, because it’s very important for moms to know this, no matter how you feed your child, you’re doing a good job. Feeding methods do not define motherhood. </p><p>I hope my own next time around is a little (a lot!) easier and I’m going to start with the same short term goals and see how things go. You never know! </p>

<p><b>WhatIWore</b>: I’m so excited about today’s post! I’ve finally finished knitting what I’ve been calling my bobble sweater! I was held up waiting for more yarn to come into my local yarn shop so it took me a little over a month to complete, but it was actually a lot easier than it looks. I also mastered continental rib knitting which made both the cowl neck and bottom sections go much faster! Read on for more details…</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p><b>When</b>: January 27, 2016</p><p><b>What</b>:<br/>Shades: Karen Walker ‘Super Duper’<br/>Sweater: Hand knit, Vogue Knitting, Winter 2008/2009 Pattern 2*<br/>Jeans: J.Crew<br/>Boots: Jeffery Campbell (really old!)</p><p><b>Where</b>: Coffee Shop laptop time</p><p>The softer gray was knit from cuff to cuff which is why the cable knits are horizontal. This part was completed first and then stitched up the side seams before starting the top yoke/collar and bottom section. I also doubled up on my yarn to create more loft. The pattern calls for a much chunkier yarn but when I saw this alpaca bamboo blend, I fell in love! Of course I can’t tell yet, but I think the color combination is pretty timeless and I hope I can wear this piece for years to come!</p><p>I did make quite a few adjustments to the design, so if you’re into that sort of thing, please read more on my <a href="http://ravelry.com/whatiwore" target="_blank">ravelry page</a>! </p><p>I also tried it on with a black skirt, tights and boots and it looked equally cute - perhaps for a different sort of morning. Today I’m just doing my thing at the coffee shop and I like how well it pairs with jeans and boots. </p>
<p>Also! If you&rsquo;re in the B-town area, I&rsquo;m hosting a Stitch and Bitch knitting circle tonight at Cardinal! See their facebook page for details!</p>

<p>Although I’m trying to watch less mindless programs (read: repeats on HGTV and E!), I really like TV! One of the shows that I’m really happy to see in it’s second season is <i>Younger</i>. </p><p>Have you seen it? The premise is of a 40 year old newly single mom who’s trying to get back into the work force. She’s talented and smart but overqualified so she decides to act like a 26 year old to get a job as an assistant in the publishing industry. The show stars Sutton Foster as Liza who makes both 40 and 26 look good. I like her character because she has the wisdom her younger friends lack but doesn&rsquo;t have a total grasp on whatever the kids are saying these days. <i>Remember when I asked what &lsquo;bae&rsquo; meant the other day on twitter?</i>. Even though it&rsquo;s fictional, I can relate. I binge watched the entire first season in a day or two and now rewatching again as I wait for new episodes (it’s on at 10 on Wednesday nights)</p>

<p><i>Younger</i> makes me think back to my single NYC days in a nostalgic sort of way.  It’s not as gritty as <i>Girls </i>(another show I love) but still entertaining. </p><p>The costume styling is inspiring and so on point - done by Patricia Fields from SATC fame. Not that I&rsquo;m planning on doing any exact copies of what they&rsquo;re wearing - it&rsquo;s just the kind of outfits that make you want to play around with what you already have in your closet. (Here’s a <a href="http://whatiwore.tumblr.com/post/13782859751/payless-style-remix-2011" target="_blank">photo/story</a> of when I met Pat in 2011! Re-reading her advice couldn’t have come at a better time for me.)</p><p><i>Younger is on TV Land and the first season is out on <a href="http://shop.tvland.com/Younger/A/141650558X.htm" target="_blank">DvD</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/1Uopz8F" target="_blank">amazon</a> and on demand with some providers. </i></p>

<p><i>Wowza! I&rsquo;m sad I have to clarify this, but no, I do not get paid to watch TV and this is not a sponsored post. I&rsquo;ve always been 100% transparent with my relationships. I&rsquo;m dabbling in writing about my other interests and obviously I&rsquo;m an amateur in doing that! But in more exciting news, next week I&rsquo;m talking about one of my favorite new costume dramas!
