My room was all white and modern BUT it was also a bit scuffed up. I used Hotwire to book my room and saved A BUNDLE. I forget now if I’ve written about my Hotwire arbitrage skillz but if not, I will in a later post. I like The James BUT I don’t like the food at The James, even though it is David Burke. Every sandwich came with too much untoasted bread and too many undercooked fries. Also, every sandwich was pretty expensive. So stay at The James if you want a nice central location, but eat elsewhere. Also, book via Hotwire. I saved $100 a night off the regular rate at time of booking. With taxes and fees, my room cost $153.87 a nght, which is a great rate for a hotel of this caliber and in this location. The <strong>Verdict</strong>: A good choice, but in need of a facelift. Try The Thompson instead.</p><p><strong>Eating & Drinking</strong></p><p>I wish I could tell you that I did some good eating and drinking while I was in Chicago, but honestly…I didn’t. I don’t know if it was bad luck or just laziness on my part. (OK, it was laziness.) I didn’t even go to Eataly, for the love of God! Here’s where I ate and drank…</p><p><strong>Kanela Breakfast Club, Wicker Park</strong>: I met my friends Amy and Larissa at Kanela Breakfast Club in Wicker Park for a Saturday brunch/lunch. Kanela is in a beautiful space largely kitted out by the oyster bar that was there before Kanela. I liked that oyster bar, but when they opened, I thought to myself “People in Wicker Park don’t eat oysters.” I was right. They didn’t last long. Judging by the crowds at Kanela, people like it here. I did not enjoy my chorizo breakfast burrito at all, and that was after waiting an hour to receive it. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Skip it. But I don’t know…everyone else seems to like it here so there’s that.</p><p><strong>O’Callaghan’s, River North</strong>: My friends Bob & Aileen were celebrating their 10 year anniversary so I popped over to O’Callaghan’s with them for some Guinness to kick off the festivities. Super friendly bar staff, although very dark interior. It was quite empty when we visited but I am sure it gets packed during the week. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: If you want a nice Irish bar in downtown Chicago, you could do worse than O’Callaghan’s.</p><p><strong>Star of Siam, River North</strong>: I used to walk by Star of Siam every day on my way to work, but yet I had never been. Well, a sudden craving for curry led us here during my visit and boy am I glad we stopped in. I loved it! I loved the decor! (All warehouse-y and spacious and nice decorated with Thai things.) I loved the service! I loved the food! Why have I not eaten here before? Star of Siam is in a bit of a strange location…you have to walk down a flight of stairs to get there from Wabash…but it seems to be a destination in its own right. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Go if you’re craving Thai in downtown Chicago.</p><p><strong>Lou Malnati’s, Rush Street</strong>: I woke up on Sunday morning and was kinda jonseing for a pizza. Don’t ask. I am ashamed of myself. I was there as soon as they opened and enjoyed my deep dish mini pan pizza in silence. UNTIL…I ran into my old colleague Leslie who caught me stuffing my face at 11 am on a Sunday morning. Lucky for me, her and her dad were planning on doing the same. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: A guilty pleasure.</p><p><strong>Soho House, West Loop</strong>: I met <a
href="http://roamandhome.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Karen</a> out for some drinks and snacks at Soho House and she gave me the grand tour. Amazing how much it feels like Shoreditch House. I mean, I guess that’s not amazing because it is the same owners and everything but they’ve really got this design thing nailed. The ground floor of Soho House was packed, the upper levels less so. The ladies’ room on the pool floor was flooded, so that was kinda gross. Also, I ordered almonds and pickles to snack on and the dish came with just three pickles. (Granted, when I pointed this out, they brought me a WHOLE BOWL of gherkins.) <strong>The Verdict</strong>: I like Soho House. Despite The Pickle Incident.</p><p><strong>Joe Stonecrab, River North</strong>: Joe’s was right around the corner from The James so we popped in here for dinner one night. I order the ahi tuna and kicked myself later. I should have stuck with what Joe’s does well…stonecrab or steak. My ahi tuna was straight out of the fridge. No sign of searing but maybe they did sear it…in a very cold, cold pan. Many people like Joe’s, but after eating here many times with those many people over the years, I’m just not a huge fan. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Meh.</p><p>So there you go…that’s my last trip to Chicago for a while, I think. Unless I become a property magnate and then maybe I will maintain residences around the world. That would be awesome.</p> ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/2015/06/quick-trip-to-chicago.html/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"6";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:10:"          ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"An Unexpected Return to Chicago, Part Deux";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/2014/11/unexpected-return-chicago-part-deux.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/2014/11/unexpected-return-chicago-part-deux.html#respond";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 10:47:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Chicago";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"United States";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/?p=6305";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:303:"I am just back in London after my work visit to Chicago…where it was friggin cold.

class="wp-caption-text">The old Tokyo Hotel, home of Ginza, one of the most traditional Japanese restaurants in Chicago before it went out of business.</p></div><p>I am just back in London after my work visit to Chicago…where it was friggin cold. Too cold. I wanted to leave, it was so cold. My nose, my nose…it is so dry. Everything is dry. My face has aged ten years overnight, in the course of two weeks. No problem then, I just stuffed my aged face at (the oddly empty) Le Colonial for lunch and  contemplated botox. (Probably wouldn’t help with the dryness though, huh?) Everything at Le Colonial was nice except for the exceptional amount of shredded lettuce served with everything. I watched the fans swirl around overhead the (seemingly all) blond ladies having lunch as I contemplated the cheapness of my UK mobile phone in the UK but the hefty £6 per mb of data fee in the U.S. Sigh. I feel so powerless. <strong>The Loos</strong>: Colonial, but they work. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Good for ladies who lunch, but hold the lettuce.</p><p><a

Darden used to run Red Lobster. They still run Capital Grill and The Olive Garden and a bunch of other places most Americans have been to for one reason or another. This is when I finally put together that Seasons 52, the people who had been repeatedly (repeatedly) pestering me to visit their property in the Chicago suburbs, were a Darden venture. It’s an interesting concept for a big chain affair…every item on the Seasons 52 menu is under 475 calories And the food is — you guessed it — seasonal!! I was honestly more than a little curious, and as Seasons 52 was right across from my hotel, The Conrad Hilton, I stumbled over there one late night after work. The decor was pleasantly surprising…no glaring lights, but rather lots of dark wood and soft lighting. And hey, THERE WAS A PIANO PLAYER. I am a bit of a sucker for a good piano player in a bar or  restaurant. I ordered some low-calorie mushroom bisque — almost as nice as the piano playing — and served with a bit of crispy (low-calorie?) bread. And then I spent $28 on a piece of sesame coated swordfish as big as my palm (and I have small hands) drenched — inedibly so — in soy sauce, with nary a sesame seed in sight. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Go for the live music and if you’re on a diet. Don’t order the swordfish.</p><p><a

It was m*ther-f*cking cold so again, I did not stray far from my hotel. The bar at Shaw’s Crabhouse it was. And guess what guys??? There was a LIVE BLUES BAND! And they were awesome. (The Friends Band…<a
href="http://thefriendsband.com/music" target="_blank">check out some of their tunes here</a>.) And while I liked my lobster bisque, I probably should have had a cup and not a bowl because the big bowl meant cold soup syndrome set in fairly soon after the soup arrived. (Too large of a surface area.) <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Worth a visit to the bar for live music (Sunday through Thursday…<a
href="http://www.shawscrabhouse.com/events/" target="_blank">schedule here</a>) and good times. Also some good happy hour oyster specials pre-band.</p><p><a

But voila! Late last Friday, it was confirmed. I was heading to Chicago — of all places — for two weeks for work. I’ve been this person before — the Chicago business traveler — but it’s been awhile. Four years? Five? So it’s been weird to be back and in a hotel for so long. And it’s been funny to have my new colleagues doubt my directions to dinner and to their hotels. (“Are you sure this is the right way???” And the ever-alarming “Well surely if we showed up with 8 people at 7 pm  on a Wednesday, they’d have a table for us.”) And it’s been even funnier to try to make dinner plans with my old friends, who want to eat at 7 pm. Ah yes, and I hate my U.K. mobile phone plan that charges me £6 a MB for data, so I have been suffering from iPhone withdrawal. (O2, I am looking at YOU.) But here’s what me, the Chicago business traveler, has been up to.</p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: I almost threw up on the hotel staff as I checked in. It was 2 am for me and I was BEAT. Jet lag hung heavy and dark around me. I went straight to bed, despite promising myself I’d head to Eataly for a little snack before bedtime.</p><p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> I made it to Eataly and had some verdure fritto misto and a glass of Gavi. Perhaps not surprisingly, while I was sitting there enjoying the free wifi and Wild Belles playing in the background (<a
href="http://www.wildbelle.com/home" target="_blank">check them out, seriously</a>), an old colleague walked by, so we had a nice little catch-up and another glass of wine. I love Eataly, especially on a slow Tuesday night when no one is around. Even though the graphic design does really bother me. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Go!</p><p><a

Unfortunately, I couldn’t get a reservation anywhere. (Lou Malnati’s on Wells does not take reservations???) So we ended up at Pizano’s on Madison, where I had the genius idea of pre-ordering our pizza so it arrived about 7 minutes after we sat down. For about $20 a person, we gorged ourselves on pizza and slugged back half-price bottles of wine. A good time. And festively decorated for the season as well. The free ice cream cakes/pies delivered to our table at the end of our meal were an extra bonus, as was our extremely competent server. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: No complaints.</p><p><a

Manny the bar back let us tether our phones to his, which was particularly awesome of him, but caused us to go deep into a dark and downward social media spiral. I like the design of Bohemian House, although it feels so much like Hubbard Inn, I thought I was in the wrong place there for a moment. I thought about eating at Boho but I just wasn’t feeling particularly hungry so I headed back to my hotel where two hours later, I decided I was ravenous and that I really wanted CHINESE FOOD. Do you know what happened next? P.F. mother f*cking Changs. You got it. I dragged my jet-lagged, freezing cold slightly slimmer American ass to P.F. Chang’s and enjoyed their spicy chicken more than I really expected to. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: Hey, sometimes, you are tired and cold and go with what is close and easy and it all works out just fine.</p><p><a

Also, modern medical technology is AMAZING. So we met up at Bistronomic with our friend T who I have known since I was 5 years old to celebrate and chat and be normal. Although A loved her steak frites, I was less than impressed. My steak was overcooked — I ordered medium rare — and and my frites were undercooked. And they weren’t really frites anyhow. (I prefer the golden shoestring style when having steak frites.) <strong>The Verdict</strong>: I want to like Bistronomic! The chef is handsome! The staff is lovely! The location is great! But yet…</p><p><a

So that sort of sucked. I like my weekends (who doesn’t really) and I am down a day. I got “home” at 9:30 pm and didn’t want to spend $57 on room service. So I went around the corner to Oysy and had some maki and it was okay. It was too cold, actually. But the staff gave me some free saki which was exactly what I needed after a day like mine. They all kinda stared at me when I entered though, and then they cleaned all the glasses like right there directly in front of me. Hmmmm…I wonder how much their rent is and how much sushi they have to sell in a month to break even. <strong>The Verdict</strong>: I will probably try some other places before going back here.</p><p><a

I love  you, totally and completely. I get lost in you. (Just like <a
href="http://art.tfl.gov.uk/labyrinth/" target="_blank">Mark Wallinger and Labyrinth, his London Underground art series of mazes</a> .) But sometimes in love, there is not-so-love. Here is the bad and the good from where I am sitting today.</p><p><strong>THE BAD…and/or the things I’ve forgotten…</strong></p><p><a
href="http://www.yelp.co.uk/c/london/restaurants" target="_blank"><strong>Yelp London is useless</strong>!</a> Barely any reviews for a lot of places.Where is everyone leaving their reviews? No one writes reviews on <a
href="http://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants" target="_blank">Time Out </a>anymore. I am left with <a
href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare,</a> and even that is kinda sucky and lacking in reviewness. HELP. I want the voice of the people. Help me.</p><p>What is with <strong>hair color on women</strong>? I’ve seen a lot of washed out pink and blue hair. I don’t like it. It looks tacky. If you’re going to do it ladies, MAINTAIN IT.</p><p><strong>Flowered trousers</strong>…perhaps a bigger thing when the weather was warmer but the patterned blousey trousers on women thing. I don’t know if I like it? Oh wait…hold on, my phone is ringing and it’s MC Hammer…</p><p><strong>Smoking</strong>…After spending the last four years in the U.S., I have honestly forgotten that people still smoke. On the sidewalk/pavement in London as I’m walking, at work when they need to take breaks and then return to stink up the meeting room, everywhere, everywhere. Smokers are everywhere. Stop putting fire in your mouths, people. It is going to kill you a lot faster than a lot of other things.</p><p><strong>Flats owned by people in Singapore and Hong Kong</strong>: I had no idea that this was a thing until I started flat-hunting this summer and when I would ask about the landlord, 9 times out of ten, they would tell me, “Oh, he/she is in Singapore/Hong Kong.” Apparently, people in Asia have bought up all the new construction property in east London these last few years. That’s fine, but if you’re going to do it love, hire a property manager. I’m not calling you in Hong Kong when the boiler’s out.</p><p><strong>Taking a shower is still hard.</strong> In my new flat, I’ve got the two-and-a-half-foot bath and the shower half-glass. I have conquered the two-and-a-half-foot bath (I think) but I HATE THE HALF-GLASS. How do British people take showers?? I do not understand it. I flood the bathroom all the time, and if my bathroom floor tile is any indication, the last tenant did too.</p><p><strong>They don’t bag your groceries for you anywhere</strong>. They just stare at you (or make no eye contact whatsoever) and then they wait for you to leave. #AWKWARD.</p><p><b>The importance of the past:</b> I learned this hard during my first tour-of-duty. In my experience, British people don’t forget any sort of past. I’m not saying that Americans forget the past, but in general, my take is that Americans have a mindset that’s much more like “Ok, that happened. That was the past. Hindsight is 20/20. Let’s move forward.” Take me out for anything Japanese/Chinese/Vietnamese and I’ll tell you more.</p><p><strong>Toasters everywhere but no toaster ovens</strong>. I just want an English Muffin pizza. Personally, I’m afraid of toaster-toasters. I’m always afraid the toast will catch fire inside. And I don’t want to fire up the broiler just for some cheese on toast.</p><p><strong>THE GOOD…</strong></p><p><strong>Tethering</strong>: My iPhone came with a wifi hotspot, as opposed to in America, where you have to pay extra for that functionality. So if you’re in London and you wanna tether to my hotspot, you just let me know.</p><p><a
href="http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/UHT-Full-Cream-Milk-essential-Waitrose/14079011?from=shop&tags=%7C20000%7C20002%7C40489%7C40519%7C13633&parentContainer=%7C20002%7C40489%7C40519%7C13633_SHELFVIEW" target="_blank"><strong>UHT MILK!</strong> </a>I love long-life milk because you know, British milk goes bad in like less than five days. (American milk lasts a lot longer, like two weeks.) So I buy UHT milk and it lasts forever. I probably don’t want to know what they did to it to make it that way, do I? A lot of people use UHT milk to make yogurt, apparently. Me, I just use it for my morning coffee.</p><p><strong>Charging for plastic bags</strong>: London started doing this ages ago. I believe California just started doing it. The U.S. is BEHIND.</p><p><strong>Pizza Express Salad dressing</strong>: Haters, don’t be hating. This stuff is STILL delicious and I go through it like white wine.</p><p><strong>The roads are smooth!</strong> I don’t know if it’s because I was unlucky enough to live in Chicago, but London roads are SMOOTH! There are no potholes! It’s amazing! I can ride my bike anywhere and not need any dental work!!</p><p><strong>Recycling</strong>: My building recycles, we recycle at work, and anywhere I go around London, there’s one of those handy separators for recycling. Me and my empty Diet Coke cans feel so virtuous. Saving the world, people. Saving the world!</p><p><strong>Direct debits! No checks!</strong> I’ve been here four months and I haven’t written ANY CHECKS. It’s amazing. I cannot believe that in America, people still write checks. It is crazy. My debit card is my favorite thing.</p><p><strong>Kettles, kettles everywhere</strong>: I love my kettle.

The time has gone quickly — way too quickly — to say the least. (Tip: Next time you quit your job, take three months off before you start your new job.) And while Chicago was never really <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDSg-v-25vg" target="_blank">my kind of town</a> (sorry, Chicagoans), after living there for a grand total of 12 years (!!!) between my two stays, there are some things I still pine for occasionally. Here’s what I’ve been missing about Chicago lately.</p><p><strong>Around Town</strong></p><ul><li><a
href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spudart/galleries/72157630183348230" target="_blank">Forgive on sidewalks</a>: Sometimes I would be walking around Ukrainian Village in a bad mood for various reasons — thinking f*ck this shit, if you really must know. And then I’d see  Forgive. And I would change the direction of my thoughts.</li><li><a
href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/paultheodore/galleries/" target="_blank">CLS and his/her sculptural street art</a>. Chicagoans, you’ve seen CLS’ stuff around town. Scraps of wood, together, in an art piece. (<a
href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/paultheodore/galleries/" target="_blank">This Flickr user</a> has a number of photographs of CLS’ pieces if you’re not sure who I’m talking about.) I like CLS’ stuff. It’s natural but architectural and yet random.</li></ul><p><strong>Mexican Food</strong></p><ul><li><a
href="http://www.cemitaspuebla.com/" target="_blank">Cemitas Puebla</a>: Mexican sandwiches. They deliver to Weegee’s in Logan Square! Now that was an exciting discovery! I want to know how they get their pork chops so thin.</li><li>Mexican in general…Mexican like the place on the corner of Chicago & Ashland, Taqueria Transpasada. Not the commercial burrito chains. London is full of burrito chains now. I just want some tacos. OK, I really want some tacos at Big Star even though I am not hipster enough for Big Star. (I realize I am, in some ways, contradicting myself. What I want is tacos from the corner shop and on weekends, tacos at Big Star, along with some Johnny Cash and bourbon.)</li><li><a
href="http://gapersblock.com/detour/in_search_of_the_tamale_guy/" target="_blank">Tamale guys</a>. Magically appearing in bars around town in the wee hours of the morning, just when we all need some carbs. GENIUS.</li></ul><p><strong>Television</strong>: <a
href="http://wgntv.com/category/morning-news/" target="_blank">WGN morning news</a>. Seriously, these guys crack me up. (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaS3ox-yJ-g" target="_blank">Check out some of their best bits from 2013</a>.) I love that they’ve been doing what they do for so long together. London breakfast news programming is terrible. They repeat themselves every 12 minutes. (I’m gonna time it.) And no jokes! And they don’t have enough human interest stories. And the news is so DIRE. Someone help me. I need something to watch in London between 6 am and 7 am while I am trying to become fully functional.</p><p><strong>Chinese: </strong><a
href="http://www.monlung.com/" target="_blank">Mon Lung</a>: My Sunday routine when I lived in Noble Square was Szechuan green beans and chicken from Mon Lung. Me and all the cops and the fish tank. I loved that the multi-generational family was so in evidence here. This is really a family-run business, and they are all so super nice. (Sometimes, they run out of green beans. Just to warn you.)</p><p><strong>Diners</strong>: <a
href="http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/pittsfield-cafe-chicago" target="_blank">The Pittsfield</a> and <a
href="http://www.beefbrandy.net/" target="_blank">Beef & Brandy</a>: I love a good diner. The Pittsfield is my absolute favorite; it’s a triangulation of beautiful building decor, friendly service, and good food. Breakfast for dinner! At The Pittsfield, I like the Mr. Gyros Omelette, which is on the old menu, not the new menu, but they will still make it for you. Make sure you ask for some tzatziki. $10 (or less) for lunch and you get table service…really nice table service. They do what they do better than a lot of expensive restaurants I know. I also like Beef & Brandy on State Street, mainly because they let you pay at the table. (At The Pittsfield, you have to pay at the counter and then walk back to your table to drop off the tip.) I also love how Beef & Brandy’s website calls it the best restaurant in downtown Chicago. I normally go for the grilled cheese at Beef & Brandy.</p><p><strong>Beer: </strong><a
href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/64228/" target="_blank">Zombie dust</a>!! All the Three Floyds! All of it!</p><p><strong>Vietnamese Food</strong>: <a
href="http://www.haiyenrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Han yen</a> on Argyle. After my trip to Vietnam in March, I got a little addicted to pho for breakfast. So once I sold off Noble Square and moved away from Mon Lung, my new Sunday routine became a trip up to Han Yen on Argyle for a big bowl of pho for Sunday lunch.</p><p><strong>Cheap Manicures and Pedicures</strong>. Particularly <a
href="http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/new-age-nail-studio-chicago" target="_blank">New Age Nails</a> on State Street north of Chicago Avenue. So clean and white and nice.</p><p><strong>Drinking</strong>: <a
href="http://popsforchampagne.com/" target="_blank">Pops for Champagne</a> & <a
href="http://watershedbar.com/" target="_blank">The Watershed</a>. London did something to me. It made me drink champagne a lot. I arrived back in the US and everyone kinda looked at me funny when I would ask if we could order a bottle of champers. So I would take myself to Pops and drown my sorrows. Champagne is not cheap in America. Champagne in London is a bargain in comparison. (There’s something to be said for being across the channel from France. ) Also, I love The Watershed, downstairs from Pops, which specializes in midwestern beers and wines. I like focus. And the banjo player on Thursday nights.</p><p>What am I forgetting? I am sure there is something!?

And then they would look at me strangely when I would say “Oh, I don’t know…I’m probably just going to order some curry from <strong>Rangoli</strong> and maybe some twice-cooked pork and string beans from <strong>Chengdu Impression</strong>.” What they wanted me to say, I do not know. (Don’t ask the question if you’re not going to like the answer.) I had no desire to hit Alinea again. (Sorry, left hungry and stopped for tacos that one time.) I was a little sad that I never visited L20 because I do love seafood more than most Chicago people. But well, other than that, I wasn’t really dying to try anything in particular.</p><p>So you know what I did before I left Chicago? I ate A LOT of chicken wings. At <strong>Jake Melnick’s</strong> downtown. I LOVE Jake Melnick’s! I love Pancho’s wings! Pancho, whoever you are, I love you. I sat at the bar at Jake Melnick’s and I ate a lot of chicken wings and drank a lot of beer. (They have A LOT of different types of beer to drink.) Sometimes I ate chicken wings with friends, sometimes I ate chicken wings by myself. But most of all, I ate chicken wings.</p><p>I also ate a lot of <strong>Chengdu Impression</strong>. It’s a very long story how I ended up in Lincoln Park during the last few days in Chicago, but I had to go to Home Depot a lot and going to Home Depot meant a trip to Chengdu Impression. The staff at Chengdu Impression are super sweet. Ask them for their help in ordering. I hope they do very very well because everything they have is all pretty delicious.</p><p>Ah, and <strong>Chicago Bagel Authority</strong>! My friend Jen’s English husband Leigh LOVES the Chicago Bagel Authority so while I was in the neighborhood, I had to check it out. I did. Many times. Although the New Yorker in me died a little every time I ate one of their **steamed** bagels, they were very tasty. And I kinda liked the intensely flirtatious bagel maker. He had nice eyes.</p><p>What else…I finally went to <strong>Longman & Eagle</strong> and it was very good but in hindsight, I don’t really remember anything we ate. I suppose that was my “cross it off the list” moment.</p><p>I did spend a lot of time at <strong>Scofflaw</strong>, drinking all the Temple Destroyers with Ben & Gerry and then Antonia. (Antonia says she’s now obsessed with <a
href="http://www.drinkspirits.com/cocktail-recipe/verdita-tequilas-friend/" target="_blank">verdita</a> and is going to attempt it. I will be there.) I don’t remember much about my time at Scofflaw either, but that was obviously for other reasons. (And remember, I am not a big mixed drink person.)</p><p>Other things…<strong>Binny’s</strong> has a new wine tasting room, so I spent a lot of time there. Ah, and I had a nice lunch at <strong>Ramen San</strong>, although I hated their stools. Hated. I really need to start that “comfortable restaurant seating” business I’ve been thinking about.</p><p>My last meal in Chicago was at Nico Osteria. I stayed two nights at the very lovely Thompson Hotel. ((My stay at The Thompson Hotel was another Hotwire bargain!) I found it easier to camp out at Nico for the afternoon after me and my five suitcases checked out of the hotel. I ate a lot of Nico’s delicious focaccia olive bread. You should too.</p><p>So…I think that about sums up my last few days/weeks in Chicago. I’m sure it’s not the last time I’ll visit the city. But hopefully when I do, it won’t be MINUS FORTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. (Which also, coincidentally, is equal to minus forty degrees Celsius.) So goodbye Chitown. Thanks for all the beer.</p><p>P.S. That photo is from the Chicago Distilling Company in Logan Square. You should visit!</p> ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/2014/07/goodbye-chicagomy-suppers.html/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"             ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Goodbye, Chicago";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/2014/06/goodbye-chicago.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/2014/06/goodbye-chicago.html#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 04:55:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Blogging";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Chicago";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"London";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"United Kingdom";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"United States";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://www.passportdelicious.com/?p=6072";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:317:"I’m on a plane!

href="http://www.passportdelicious.com/2013/05/lima-peru.html" target="_blank">I’m going to Lima by myself. You should come!</a>” And I say things like “Francis, you can’t say things like this to me because I will actually come with you.” And before you know it, <a
href="https://twitter.com/aschie30" target="_blank">Wendy</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Brien" target="_blank">Maureen</a> are coming too and Francis turns out to be the TRAVEL MASTER ORGANIZER and has an agenda for us and everything and we eat all the fruit and drink all the pisco sours and leave Lima very very happy.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">Francis proved to be the master organizer yet again when he marched us little ducklings off to Tanta, the new Peruvian place in Chicago by Peruvian chef Gaston Arcurio, whom some may be familiar with from World’s 50 Best <a
href="http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/astrid-y-gaston/" target="_blank">Astrid & Gaston</a>. (Almost wrote Gastrid and Ashton there. Whoops.)</p><p
style="text-align: left;">I’m worried about Tanta’s location. Although it’s in River North, it’s in a bit of a desolate stretch of Grand close to Lasalle. Signage is also a little discreet for River North, but maybe that’s not a bad thing. I can imagine the tourists walking by…”Should we go here? I don’t know…Tanta? What does that mean? Do they have steak here? Do you think I can put ketchup on it? I hope they open at 5.”</p><p
style="text-align: left;">But once inside, I love the space. I love the bar and would happily come back here to dine solo. I love that it’s not too uber-stuffed with tables and chairs. There’s an appreciation of personal space here that is just really nice.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">That being said, personal space is on overdrive at the back of the restaurant at our table, which is too wide and too long for our party of five. I am the fifth wheel. And the restaurant is LOUD and my hearing is not as bionic as it used to be. I am alone at the end of the table, but the lovely and gracious <a
href="https://twitter.com/mstashwick" target="_blank">Mr. Stashwick</a> is a wonderful table-mate.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">Enough babble. Let’s talk CHICKEN. I cannot profess my love of a full roast chicken enough. Roast chicken is one of my absolute favorite things to eat and to make. (Yes, you read that correctly…to make!) While I hate restaurant chicken breast entrees (too frozen Restaurant Depot for me), I love a pick-at-it-all-day-and-all-night-long roast chicken. And Tanta’s is probably one of the best I’ve ever had. The presentation is awesome…so many sides and lovely crisp potatoes that are even crisp the next morning when I polish them off as leftovers for breakfast. Seriously, this is very good stuff, very excellent, supremely competent stuff.</p><p
style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Verdict</strong>: I will be back here soon. You should go too. Maybe we should go together and drink all the Pisco Sours together.</p><p
style="text-align: left;"><strong>P.S.</strong> It’s perhaps worthy to note that we received special treatment the night we came in because Francis was super-excited about the restaurant’s opening and had been in touch with Gaston Arcurio and staff. The chef came out a few times to talk with us, along with some of the other senior staff. Also, we were comped a few dishes; my apologies but because I was not in charge of the bill, I’m not sure what exactly we were comped but it was a small amount in relation to the overall bill. We tipped as if we had not been comped, of course.</p><p><a

style="text-align: left;">Long-term readers will know that on Fridays during the summer, I can leave work early if I want to. And I’ve been trying to do that this summer, trying to get out there and explore places and do things and see things. Someone told me that I would love Beatrix so I went to Beatrix on one of my Friday afternoons. Because I am trusting like that.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">And I did like Beatrix. Sort of. I mean, I liked the chairs. There are a lot of different chairs at Beatrix. It’s one of those new-school/old-school all day free-wifi restaurants with lots and lots of chairs for people so you can sit down or you can stand up or you can stay for 20 minutes or you can stay for EIGHT HOURS (like the people across from me did). Lots of interesting, different chairs. Really, there’s something for everyone. Really, it felt like a total ripoff of <a
href="http://www.passportdelicious.com/2010/08/10-reasons-why-i-love-londons-hoxton-hotel.html">London’s Hoxton Hotel</a>.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">“Have the burger,” some guy at the bar urged me. “I just did and it was really really good.”</p><p
style="text-align: left;">Apparently that man has never had a burger in HIS ENTIRE LIFE.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">Because the burger was shite. Super shite. Overcooked sawdust.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">And the fries were undercooked.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">And the pickled vegetables were still too raw.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">When I left, I was angry at myself for wasting my Friday lunch here. Very angry.</p><p
style="text-align: left;">All that being said, they were jackhammering the road outside the restaurant and you never would have known it inside the restaurant. That’s some good sound-proofing they’ve got going there.</p><p
style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Verdict</strong>: But no.</p><p><a
