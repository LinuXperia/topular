Nothing ever seems to come easy for Anthrax. Label issues, personnel problems, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/11/anthrax.uk" target="_blank">PR nightmares</a> and more have all plagued the New York metal stalwarts at some point over their thirty-five years.

But due largely in part to their work ethic, and uncanny ability to relate to their fans, Anthrax never went away.  And following the period of uncertainty fraught with <a href="http://www.metalinsider.net/legal-woes/anthrax-vs-dan-nelson-the-lawsuit-addition" target="_blank">lawsuits</a> which led up to the eventual release of their tenth studio album <em>Worhsip Music</em> in 2011, the band has entered what seems to be one of the strongest prolonged periods of their entire career.

Beginning with their 2010 participation in the "<a href="http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/tom-araya-says-the-big-four-will-never-happen-again-because-of-politics-of-character-in-one-particular-band" target="_blank">Big Four</a>" concerts (alongside Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth), which brought arguably their most successful vocalist Joey Belladonna back into the fold, Anthrax has maintained a fairly stable lineup, allowing for the relentless, five year period of touring with bands like Volbeat, Slayer and Lamb of God that followed.

The strength of those tours, and savvy placement on select festivals (like the Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Fest in 2012 beside Motörhead, Slipknot and more), unquestionably grew the Anthrax fan base, expanding their appeal amongst a new, younger generation of metal fans.

The band is set to capitalize on all of that work in February with the release of the latest Anthrax studio effort, <em>For All Kings</em> (February 26th, Megaforce Records) and the feature of their profile as part of the Smithsonian's new "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMEbSw7tGHU" target="_blank">Places of Invention</a>" exhibit.

Excited for fans to hear their new music, I spoke with Anthrax bassist Frank Bello about the forthcoming album <em>For All Kings</em>, writing melodies to fit Joey Belladonna's vocals for the first time in twenty-five years, falling off the stage at Aragon Ballroom, the legacy of Motörhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister, touring Europe at the time of the 2015 terror attacks in Paris at the Bataclan and much more...

<strong>Q. You guys are a handful of dates into a tour that brings you back to the familiar territory of the Aragon Ballroom.  How has it gone with Lamb of God so far and how’s the live reaction been to the new Anthrax music?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Anthrax website..." href="http://anthrax.com/" target="_blank"><em>Frank Bello</em></a>: It's been great. We've been going at it for a pretty long time now and we have a new cycle coming up. The new record comes out February 26th:  <em>For All Kings.</em>  This is a great set up, the tour we're doing with Lamb of God, just because it's not only our fan base coming but Lamb of God's fan base coming. You can actually see it in the crowd. It's a really great vibe. It's a packed house every night, it's a good metal vibe going on and it's a great set up for the record.

But I think I fell off the stage at Aragon one time. I forget when that was. I don't know if it was the 80's or 90's. Whenever it was, we played there in the early days. I remember there was a piece of the stage that wasn't there and I didn't know about it!  I went through something with my bass. (Laughs)

I think my tech at the time - thank God for this - he caught me before I went all the way through. Because it's a high stage, right? I remember my foot going through one of the planks or something in the front and I was like, "Noooo!" And all the sudden he caught me just before there was... damage.

So don't go near that side of the stage!

<strong>Q. Let’s talk about the new album. As well received as <em>Worship Music</em> was in 2011 with Joey Belladonna back on vocals, the whole process for this album seems like it was a lot different. This is the first Anthrax album to feature melodies written specifically for Joey’s voice in over twenty-five years. You’re primarily responsible for the melodies so how was it different for you this time around when it came time to start writing <em>For All Kings</em>?</strong>

FB: It's much easier to write when you know who's doing the singing! (Laughs)  Charlie and Scott and I, we get together and we always write the best Anthrax that we can. The song that turns us on, that gets us going, is the fire in your belly. You know what I mean? It's a whole lot easier to know who's putting the cherry on top with the vocals.

And Joey is just an incredible singer. I'll tell you, I'm next to him on stage every night. The guy is better than ever. And I have to say that - not because I'm in the band - because I'm a fan. This guy has got the chops. It's fun to watch.

I really can't wait till people hear <em>For All Kings</em> because I really think it's his best vocal performance ever. I honestly feel that.

<strong>Q. Charlie used a lot of his down time following <a href="http://loudwire.com/anthrax-charlie-benante-surgery-carpal-tunnel-syndrome/" target="_blank">surgery</a> to write. Between the writing of you, [drummer] Charlie Benante and [guitarist] Scott Ian, it sounds like the band entered the studio with more material than ever before. How did you go about whittling all of that material down into the finished <em>For All Kings</em> album?</strong>

FB: We did. Charlie was home for awhile with his injury but Scott and I had music too. So it was great for the three of us to get together and just start putting songs together musically and then actually make them into Anthrax songs.  It was a good process just to get into the studio again. Because we were touring <em>so</em> much. We continue to tour so much.

But you know what's good about this whole thing? It's good to be touring. Because it's the only way to do it nowadays to get your music out there. But every time we thought we could take a break and start writing, we were asked to do another great tour. It was great tour after great tour after great tour. So we really couldn't say no.  And it was all worthwhile. We grew the fanbase. There's a whole new demographic of people out there who hadn't heard Anthrax and now they have. From the "Big Four" on, it's pretty much been nonstop.

It's been a great ride and we couldn't be more humbled or happier quite honestly. We can't wait for this new record to come out.

<strong>Q. This record marks Jonathan Donais' first studio work as a member of Anthrax . You guys were able to tour with him on guitar a bit before recording with him. Did that make a difference upon finally entering the studio with him?</strong>

FB: Totally. Absolutely. Jon's always been a great player with Shadows Fall. He's just a great player. I was a fan of Shadows Fall and they're still friends of mine, all that stuff.

But to have Jon in the band and really be comfortable getting in... Jon is very much a part of the band. He's in the band. He's definitely become way more comfortable. He's one of us now. That's the way we feel - onstage, backstage. He's my drinking budddy on the days off. (Laughs)

We definitely have a good time. There's a great vibe within the band.

<strong>Q. Obviously the years leading up to the release of <em>Worship Music</em> weren’t easy ones with the <a href="http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-settles-lawsuit-with-former-singer-dan-nelson/" target="_blank">legal battles</a>, questions surrounding the lineup, etc. But it seems like you guys are on a real roll right now - there seems to be a lot of buzz around the upcoming album release. With the fairly relentless touring that you just talked about over the course of the last five years, do you feel like you’re kind of capitalizing on that work now with the release of this new album?</strong>

FB: Here's what I think: I think you have to work. You cannot rely on anything else but good, hard work. That's the way we've always been. Our work ethic has always been there. You don't get nothing for nothing, that's the line. That's the way we grew up as New York guys. You don't just get handed anything. You have to work and make people know. You have to work and put out the best record we could. We have to do the best tours we can to make people hear this.  Hopefully we get some radio play - whatever radio there is out there - and do what we have to do to make it happen.

Look, this is the way we did it in the 80's. We're very much used to this. We are a very hardworking band and I'm so happy to see there's a buzz on the new Anthrax record.  Thirty years in, we're talking about being a relevant band in 2016. And for one of the more anticipated records of 2016 to be <em>For All Kings</em>? It's an amazing feeling and, I'm telling you, we couldn't be more psyched. We're stoked about that.

<strong>Q. It’s obviously difficult in this day and age to build buzz around a new album. And I think that’s what really intrigues me about this particular period for your band, that there’s not just interest in the live dates – because Anthrax has always had that reputation as a great live act – but there’s that buzz around the album too.  Not that Anthrax ever went away but does all this buzz right now around new Anthrax music kind of make for almost a new beginning for you guys, or at least mark a significant new chapter in the story?</strong>

FB: Absolutely. You hit it on the head.

The real reason why there's an energy within the band, we know we've tapped into a good vein, is from the writing. It all starts with the writing. It's all about the songs. Period. You could have the name out there - and it's an iconic name, it's been around forever and that's great - but unless you have the goods in the songs and put out the right record and take care of those songs and nurture them...

Look, we took a long time to write this record. We edited it and we made sure every part was the right part on each song. We really took a long time and lived with the record and then came back to it and restructured it and made sure it was the right record we wanted to put out. So a lot goes into an Anthrax record.

And then you have to take care of the touring cycle. And that's where we're at now. To have a record coming out next month - and this is the beginning of setting it up on the Lamb of God tour - it's all great stuff. I actually can't believe it. I'm really stoked on it. Because I know the touring plans we have coming!

I say this in the most fanboy way... In March, we're touring all of South America with Iron Maiden. And here's the fanboy moment I'm going to give you. Number one, those are all stadiums and are all crazy. Iron Maiden, we're friends with them and we're huge fans of their's but then we actually get to fly on their plane with them!

<strong>With Bruce [Dickinson] piloting...</strong>

FB:  He will be! There's my fanboy moment - just how psyched I am. We have a new record. It's all great.  Anthrax is booked until September right now and, as we speak, we're booking September coming up. It's gonna be a busy year! It's definitely a good problem.

But it's all from hard work. It's not the easiest thing to be on the road. We just finished Europe with Slayer [this past] October, November and December. It doesn't come easy when you have a family at home. It's definitely a different vibe. But it's all worthwhile to know that the hard work is progressing and paying off because people are getting it and they understand what we are which is great.

<strong>Q. You just mentioned the European dates with Slayer and obviously you guys were there during the terrorist attacks in Paris. What was it like going from that type of touring atmosphere and coming back to tour now in the United States?</strong>

FB: We just kept going. We never thought about... Unless the promoters wanted us to stop playing that tour - or there was a risk to our fans or the band and crew and stuff like that - we always had every intention to continue that tour.

I live in New York so it's a different kind of thing. Everybody has to be careful about everything nowadays. That's just the world we live in now. What you have to do is live your life. That's more important than anything. You cannot not live your life. You have to move on and not cower to anything. You have to live your life as normal as you can do it.

<strong>Q. You’ve used a word several times today that I’ve seen you use in virtually every interview you give and that word is “fan.” That’s something that has always struck me about metal artists – that there seems to be very little disconnect between the artists and the fans. To me, it’s kind of unparalleled anywhere else in music and it’s what I think made someone like Lemmy Kilmister so beloved across so many different generations. How important is that idea of not losing touch with your fan base to the success of Anthrax at this stage of the game in the current music industry landscape?</strong>

FB: Wow. To be honest, I'm a fan. I'm a fan who got lucky. I feel very lucky and fortunate to play music for a living.

You cannot forget where you came from. That's my values from growing up. My Grandmother told me that: "Don't forget where you came from." That's struck true for everything in my life.

So I will never stop being a fan of music and this music and all kinds of music. I'm very fortunate that I've gotten to make a living doing this. Believe me, I'm thankful for it every day. But I don't think you should ever lose touch with where you came from or who you are.

I will always be a fan because I think that's the only way that you can connect with people and understand music. I think if we write music that we're into, there will be a lot of people that like it the same way because they're fans the same way we are. I think it's all one.

But the legacy of Lemmy is he is an amazing icon as we all know. Lemmy was also just a really great dude, a really nice guy when you talk to him. He was just a really good guy. He'd talk about anything. For me, particularly, it was about bass and tones and rock and roll tones and stuff like that. Just a really good guy.

You know what the great thing about Lemmy was, for me, even before I was friends with him? I thought that Lemmy always did it his way. He made it ok to be yourself. For me, that meant a lot growing up. Seeing him, he was himself no matter what and he didn't care what anybody else said. I think that carries a lot with people. A lot of people can relate to that. I certainly did. I still do to this day. I think that can really translate and go across to a lot of people.

There will never be another Lemmy. God rest his soul. I'm glad for his time on earth and the music he left us.

<strong>Q. Charlie used a lot of his down time following <a href="http://loudwire.com/anthrax-charlie-benante-surgery-carpal-tunnel-syndrome/" target="_blank">surgery</a> to write. Between the writing of you, [drummer] Charlie Benante and [guitarist] Scott Ian, it sounds like the band entered the studio with more material than ever before. How did you go about whittling all of that material down into the finished <em>For All Kings</em> album?</strong>

FB: We did. Charlie was home for awhile with his injury but Scott and I had music too. So it was great for the three of us to get together and just start putting songs together musically and then actually make them into Anthrax songs.  It was a good process just to get into the studio again. Because we were touring <em>so</em> much. We continue to tour so much.

But you know what's good about this whole thing? It's good to be touring. Because it's the only way to do it nowadays to get your music out there. But every time we thought we could take a break and start writing, we were asked to do another great tour. It was great tour after great tour after great tour. So we really couldn't say no.  And it was all worthwhile. We grew the fanbase. There's a whole new demographic of people out there who hadn't heard Anthrax and now they have. From the "Big Four" on, it's pretty much been nonstop.

It's been a great ride and we couldn't be more humbled or happier quite honestly. We can't wait for this new record to come out.

<strong>Q. This record marks Jonathan Donais' first studio work as a member of Anthrax . You guys were able to tour with him on guitar a bit before recording with him. Did that make a difference upon finally entering the studio with him?</strong>

FB: Totally. Absolutely. Jon's always been a great player with Shadows Fall. He's just a great player. I was a fan of Shadows Fall and they're still friends of mine, all that stuff.

But to have Jon in the band and really be comfortable getting in... Jon is very much a part of the band. He's in the band. He's definitely become way more comfortable. He's one of us now. That's the way we feel - onstage, backstage. He's my drinking budddy on the days off. (Laughs)

We definitely have a good time. There's a great vibe within the band.

<strong>Q. Obviously the years leading up to the release of <em>Worship Music</em> weren’t easy ones with the <a href="http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-settles-lawsuit-with-former-singer-dan-nelson/" target="_blank">legal battles</a>, questions surrounding the lineup, etc. But it seems like you guys are on a real roll right now - there seems to be a lot of buzz around the upcoming album release. With the fairly relentless touring that you just talked about over the course of the last five years, do you feel like you’re kind of capitalizing on that work now with the release of this new album?</strong>

FB: Here's what I think: I think you have to work. You cannot rely on anything else but good, hard work. That's the way we've always been. Our work ethic has always been there. You don't get nothing for nothing, that's the line. That's the way we grew up as New York guys. You don't just get handed anything. You have to work and make people know. You have to work and put out the best record we could. We have to do the best tours we can to make people hear this.  Hopefully we get some radio play - whatever radio there is out there - and do what we have to do to make it happen.

Look, this is the way we did it in the 80's. We're very much used to this. We are a very hardworking band and I'm so happy to see there's a buzz on the new Anthrax record.  Thirty years in, we're talking about being a relevant band in 2016. And for one of the more anticipated records of 2016 to be <em>For All Kings</em>? It's an amazing feeling and, I'm telling you, we couldn't be more psyched. We're stoked about that.

<strong>Q. It’s obviously difficult in this day and age to build buzz around a new album. And I think that’s what really intrigues me about this particular period for your band, that there’s not just interest in the live dates – because Anthrax has always had that reputation as a great live act – but there’s that buzz around the album too.  Not that Anthrax ever went away but does all this buzz right now around new Anthrax music kind of make for almost a new beginning for you guys, or at least mark a significant new chapter in the story?</strong>

FB: Absolutely. You hit it on the head.

The real reason why there's an energy within the band, we know we've tapped into a good vein, is from the writing. It all starts with the writing. It's all about the songs. Period. You could have the name out there - and it's an iconic name, it's been around forever and that's great - but unless you have the goods in the songs and put out the right record and take care of those songs and nurture them...

Look, we took a long time to write this record. We edited it and we made sure every part was the right part on each song. We really took a long time and lived with the record and then came back to it and restructured it and made sure it was the right record we wanted to put out. So a lot goes into an Anthrax record.

And then you have to take care of the touring cycle. And that's where we're at now. To have a record coming out next month - and this is the beginning of setting it up on the Lamb of God tour - it's all great stuff. I actually can't believe it. I'm really stoked on it. Because I know the touring plans we have coming!

I say this in the most fanboy way... In March, we're touring all of South America with Iron Maiden. And here's the fanboy moment I'm going to give you. Number one, those are all stadiums and are all crazy. Iron Maiden, we're friends with them and we're huge fans of their's but then we actually get to fly on their plane with them!

<strong>With Bruce [Dickinson] piloting...</strong>

FB:  He will be! There's my fanboy moment - just how psyched I am. We have a new record. It's all great.  Anthrax is booked until September right now and, as we speak, we're booking September coming up. It's gonna be a busy year! It's definitely a good problem.

But it's all from hard work. It's not the easiest thing to be on the road. We just finished Europe with Slayer [this past] October, November and December. It doesn't come easy when you have a family at home. It's definitely a different vibe. But it's all worthwhile to know that the hard work is progressing and paying off because people are getting it and they understand what we are which is great.

<strong>Q. You just mentioned the European dates with Slayer and obviously you guys were there during the terrorist attacks in Paris. What was it like going from that type of touring atmosphere and coming back to tour now in the United States?</strong>

FB: We just kept going. We never thought about... Unless the promoters wanted us to stop playing that tour - or there was a risk to our fans or the band and crew and stuff like that - we always had every intention to continue that tour.

I live in New York so it's a different kind of thing. Everybody has to be careful about everything nowadays. That's just the world we live in now. What you have to do is live your life. That's more important than anything. You cannot not live your life. You have to move on and not cower to anything. You have to live your life as normal as you can do it.

<strong>Q. You’ve used a word several times today that I’ve seen you use in virtually every interview you give and that word is “fan.” That’s something that has always struck me about metal artists – that there seems to be very little disconnect between the artists and the fans. To me, it’s kind of unparalleled anywhere else in music and it’s what I think made someone like Lemmy Kilmister so beloved across so many different generations. How important is that idea of not losing touch with your fan base to the success of Anthrax at this stage of the game in the current music industry landscape?</strong>

FB: Wow. To be honest, I'm a fan. I'm a fan who got lucky. I feel very lucky and fortunate to play music for a living.

You cannot forget where you came from. That's my values from growing up. My Grandmother told me that: "Don't forget where you came from." That's struck true for everything in my life.

So I will never stop being a fan of music and this music and all kinds of music. I'm very fortunate that I've gotten to make a living doing this. Believe me, I'm thankful for it every day. But I don't think you should ever lose touch with where you came from or who you are.

I will always be a fan because I think that's the only way that you can connect with people and understand music. I think if we write music that we're into, there will be a lot of people that like it the same way because they're fans the same way we are. I think it's all one.

But the legacy of Lemmy is he is an amazing icon as we all know. Lemmy was also just a really great dude, a really nice guy when you talk to him. He was just a really good guy. He'd talk about anything. For me, particularly, it was about bass and tones and rock and roll tones and stuff like that. Just a really good guy.

You know what the great thing about Lemmy was, for me, even before I was friends with him? I thought that Lemmy always did it his way. He made it ok to be yourself. For me, that meant a lot growing up. Seeing him, he was himself no matter what and he didn't care what anybody else said. I think that carries a lot with people. A lot of people can relate to that. I certainly did. I still do to this day. I think that can really translate and go across to a lot of people.

There will never be another Lemmy. God rest his soul. I'm glad for his time on earth and the music he left us.

"Same three guys.  Same three chords."

Those have frequently been the words used by Billy Gibbons to describe his band ZZ Top throughout a career spanning the nearly fifty years since their 1969 formation.

Along the way, Gibbons and his two bandmates (bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard) have covered a lot of ground, beginning in Houston, Texas and stopping along the way in places like Cleveland, Ohio for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2004).  ZZ Top's became a life spent on the road which has continued seemingly uninterrupted ever since.

But of late, those words have taken on a special irony as Gibbons began touring with a new band, celebrating diverse sounds on the only solo record he's ever released, November's <em>Perfectamundo</em>.

It's an album that grew out of  an invitation to perform in Cuba at the 2014 Havana Jazz Festival.  Unable to make it in 2014, but inspired creatively by the invite, Gibbons assembled a new band and hit the studio, ready to make a record based not on the influence of the blues guitarists that longtime ZZ Top fans have come to expect but one instead that celebrates rhythm.

Unbeknownst to most, at a young age, Billy Gibbons was schooled in the Latin rhythm of conga, bongos, maracas, timbales and more by legendary American musician and Latin jazz composer Tito Puente, a family friend.

Drawing on those early New York based lessons in Latin percussion, Gibbons began work in 2015 on the Afro-Cuban influenced sessions that would eventually make up his first solo album: <em>Perfectamundo</em>.  Album in hand, Gibbons finally made good on that 2014 invitation by performing in Cuba at the Havana Jazz Festival for the first time this past December.

Returning to the Chicagoland area with his new backing band The BFG's for a set Friday night in St. Charles, I checked in via email with Billy Gibbons to find out more about his experience in Cuba, his early lessons in rhythm under the guidance of Tito Puente, the difference between writing <em>Perfectamundo</em> as opposed to writing for ZZ Top, the influence of the Chicago blues and much more.

<strong>Q. The  <em>Perfectamundo</em> sessions came out of a late 2014 invitation to perform at the Havana Jazz Fest, an invite which you made good on this past December. What was it like finally performing the Afro-Cuban inspired music of <em>Perfectamundo</em> in front of the audience that inspired it and how would you rate your experience in Cuba in general?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Billy Gibbons website..." href="http://www.billygibbons.com/" target="_blank"><em>Billy Gibbons</em></a>: Quite a positive excursion all the way around.

The Cuban audiences were actually already onto ZZ Top and seemed sincerely appreciative of the effort "The BFG's" made by doing something totally relating within the Afro-Cuban element. The enthusiasm was underscored with a plethora of rump shaking which we took as a sign of enthusiastic approval.

<strong>Q. Your training at an early age with Tito Puente obviously looms large over the new music.  What would you say is the most important thing you learned from Tito Puente?</strong>

BG: Aside from the basics of rhythm, the credo Tito imparted was, "Play what you want to hear and deliver with deliberation."

In short, he pressed perfection while sharing encouragement to do whatever I wanted in the most powerful manner.

<strong>Q. Rhythm seems to be key to the success of <em>Perfectamundo</em>. Was it difficult, initially, to think more in that vein as opposed to when you're writing and recording with ZZ Top?</strong>

BG: Well, from the beginning with <em>Perfectamundo</em>, we put the rhythm up front as opposed to having it out back like we do with ZZ Top.  With the rhythm dominant, the guitar parts fill in the blanks and punctuate what the rhythm section puts down.

It’s two sides of the same coin yet, with <em>Perfectamundo</em>, the band always called “tails.”

<strong>Q. ZZ Top, over the course of the last forty-five years or so, has become the epitome of a power trio.  But your current tour with The BFG's features more instrumentation and players, as well as sounds outside the blues and rock arena that casual fans might not be expecting. Has it been rewarding to expand your palette like that in the live setting after all this time?</strong>

BG: With ZZ, we get the most out of the least — it is definitely an exercise in unfettered minimalism which is why it seems to come across as powerfully as we think it does.

<em>Perfectamundo</em> has more filigree - some of it from the expanded rhythm section and some from the Hammond organ's presence - which lands the bonus of sound exploration.

Our pre-ZZ band, the <a title="Click HERE for more info on The Moving Sidewalks..." href="http://movingsidewalks.com/" target="_blank">Moving Sidewalks</a>, included the B3 so we’ve been down that road before… always a good way to keep sonically limber.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Billy Gibbons And The BFG's - Friday, January 29, 2016 Arcada Theatre St. Charles" alt="Billy Gibbons And The BFG's - Friday, January 29, 2016 Arcada Theatre St. Charles" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-at-night/files/2016/01/Billy-Gibbons-Arcada-Theatre-St.-Charles-January-29-2016-e1453910658233.jpg" width="378" height="222" /></p>
<strong>Q. Growing up around Houston, obviously the playing of Lightnin' Hopkins was a major early influence on both your style and the music you'd come to create with ZZ Top.  But sometimes I feel like Chicago blues is an understated influence as well. I've seen you mention Jimmy Reed as an influence - as well as B.B. King's <em>Live at the Regal</em> album which was recorded here - so I'm curious about your early exposure to the Chicago blues: how big of an influence was it as you started to develop your identity as a blues guitar player?</strong>

BG: In a word: Huge!

We were immersed with Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters whose recorded sides became the inspiration. There’s no question that the sides recorded at <a title="Click HERE for more info on Chess Records..." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Records" target="_blank">2120 S. Michigan Avenue</a> and over at <a title="Click HERE for more info on VeeJay Records..." href="http://www.veejayrecords.net/" target="_blank">VeeJay</a> had a monumental impact on our worldview.  Of course, these were the giants whose contributions can never be understated.

We shared quite a few bills with Muddy Waters and it was always an honor to be in his presence. ZZ Top inducted Howlin’ Wolf into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and have been in touch with his family ever since.

And while we’re on the subject of Chess, we can't forget the great Bo Diddley, Little Walter, Lazy Lester, Sonny Boy Williamson and on with host of others.

Electric blues changed everything and its impact on rock resonates to this day.

<strong>Q. ZZ Top grasped the potential power of MTV earlier than a lot of their colleagues and really capitalized on the power of the music video beginning in 1983 following the release of <em>Eliminator</em>. MTV, despite the "music television" still in its name, obviously isn't much in the business of featuring music videos these days - but the medium itself still seems like an important one to you as you've released an entertaining new video for "<a title="Check out the official Billy Gibbons video fro &quot;Treat Her Right&quot; on YouTube..." href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKtgvc06H10" target="_blank">Treat Her Right</a>." All the elements that made those ZZ Top videos so memorable are there - women, cars, guitars, etc. The new video has over 300,000 hits on YouTube. Is the short form music video as a story-telling device still an important one to you?</strong>

BG: Well, yes… it really is important as we lean toward using every means at hand to get the message out, both sonically and visually.

In those early videos the aim was to intentionally keep the visual presence with the band to the minimum. Looking at pretty girls and shiny cars is way easier!

The same holds true for “Treat Her Right.” I’m in there a bit, mostly in an advisory capacity.

<strong>Q. Growing up around Houston, obviously the playing of Lightnin' Hopkins was a major early influence on both your style and the music you'd come to create with ZZ Top.  But sometimes I feel like Chicago blues is an understated influence as well. I've seen you mention Jimmy Reed as an influence - as well as B.B. King's <em>Live at the Regal</em> album which was recorded here - so I'm curious about your early exposure to the Chicago blues: how big of an influence was it as you started to develop your identity as a blues guitar player?</strong>

BG: In a word: Huge!

We were immersed with Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters whose recorded sides became the inspiration. There’s no question that the sides recorded at <a title="Click HERE for more info on Chess Records..." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Records" target="_blank">2120 S. Michigan Avenue</a> and over at <a title="Click HERE for more info on VeeJay Records..." href="http://www.veejayrecords.net/" target="_blank">VeeJay</a> had a monumental impact on our worldview.  Of course, these were the giants whose contributions can never be understated.

We shared quite a few bills with Muddy Waters and it was always an honor to be in his presence. ZZ Top inducted Howlin’ Wolf into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and have been in touch with his family ever since.

And while we’re on the subject of Chess, we can't forget the great Bo Diddley, Little Walter, Lazy Lester, Sonny Boy Williamson and on with host of others.

Electric blues changed everything and its impact on rock resonates to this day.

<strong>Q. ZZ Top grasped the potential power of MTV earlier than a lot of their colleagues and really capitalized on the power of the music video beginning in 1983 following the release of <em>Eliminator</em>. MTV, despite the "music television" still in its name, obviously isn't much in the business of featuring music videos these days - but the medium itself still seems like an important one to you as you've released an entertaining new video for "<a title="Check out the official Billy Gibbons video fro &quot;Treat Her Right&quot; on YouTube..." href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKtgvc06H10" target="_blank">Treat Her Right</a>." All the elements that made those ZZ Top videos so memorable are there - women, cars, guitars, etc. The new video has over 300,000 hits on YouTube. Is the short form music video as a story-telling device still an important one to you?</strong>

BG: Well, yes… it really is important as we lean toward using every means at hand to get the message out, both sonically and visually.

In those early videos the aim was to intentionally keep the visual presence with the band to the minimum. Looking at pretty girls and shiny cars is way easier!

The same holds true for “Treat Her Right.” I’m in there a bit, mostly in an advisory capacity.

Throughout their forty years, Air Supply have weathered not just music industry changes to radio and labels during the rise of the internet but constantly evolving American music tastes as well, outlasting trends like punk, disco, grunge and more along the way.

The key to that success would seem to be an unwavering confidence in their own songs powered by the unbroken strength of the partnership between Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell in an industry where such a thing is extremely uncommon.

At times it was "cool" to like Air Supply while other times it wasn't.  For some, today, fandom is of an ironic sense.  But as Hitchcock is quick to point out, it never really mattered as Air Supply eventually sold more than twenty million records, standing beside artists like The Beatles with a run of seven consecutive singles reaching the American top five.

Regardless of the impressive numbers, perhaps the most surprising chart appearance came only last year, as Air Supply cracked the Billboard dance charts for the first time with a pair of tracks: "Desert, Sea Sky" was remixed by UK producers Wideboys and hit number forty-three on the Billboard Dance Club Play chart while their own "I Want You" cracked the top forty, reaching number thirty-five on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart this past September.

Even as American music consumption methods have begun to shift, the Australian duo continues to log more than one hundred live concert dates each year across the world, part of a seemingly unending tour that brings Air Supply to the Stardust Event Center at Blue Chip Casino in Michigan City, Indiana Saturday night.

I spoke over the phone with Russell Hitchcock about what makes his partnership with Graham Russell work, some of his favorite singers, run-ins over the years with heavy metal stalwarts like Ronnie James Dio and original AC/DC singer Bon Scott in a much different music industry landscape and what has allowed Air Supply to transcend cultural changes as they celebrate their fortieth anniversary.   A lightly edited transcript of that conversation follows below...

<strong>Q.  Air Supply logs a tremendous number of live dates each year.  More impressive still is the amount of international touring you guys do.  What's it like after forty years to still be able to hit the road like that?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Air Supply website..." href="http://www.airsupplymusic.com/" target="_blank"><em>Russell Hitchcock</em></a>:  After forty years, it's just something that's kind of in our DNA now.  I guess the big difference now is it's a lot harder to get places.  Travel is much more of a pain than it used to be with security being as it should be.

But we've never really thought too much about it.  We're very grateful to be in this position to be able to tour as much as we do at the level that we do.  We've got fans all over the world so it's really something very special for us to be able to look back and say that we started in 1975 and we've been on the road every year since without a break.  It's quite an achievement.

<strong>Q.  Who are some of your favorite singers?</strong><strong></strong>

RH:  I was introduced to music in my parents' house.  I used to listen to Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett when I was a kid.  The biggest change for me in how I listened, and what I wanted to listen to, was when I heard the Beatles for the first time.  I think Paul McCartney has got one of the best voices I've ever heard.  Robert Plant.  There's a guy in Australia named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farnham" target="_blank">John Farnham</a> who hasn't had any recognition in America at all.  He's got the best voice I've ever heard.  I just like good voices.  Freddie Mercury was a favorite of mine.

And I like groups that sing well together.  I am a big fan of the Eagles and Bee Gees.  The vocals that Queen did.

On the other end of the spectrum, I am a huge fan of Brian Johnson from AC/DC.  I think he's got a great voice.  Steve Perry.  Just all good singers.  I love them all.

<strong>Q.  You and Graham have such a unique partnership in that you actually get along.  Music history is littered with examples of the opposite. How do you guys continue to make it work?</strong>

RH:  First of all, we don't think about it.  It just happens.  But I think the fact that we don't compete with each other in Air Supply [helps]. Graham writes the songs and I sing a lot of them.  We don't have big egos within each other's realm.

We didn't start off doing this as youngsters.  We were kind of reasonably mature when we started.  We have a great respect for each other.  We're the best of friends.  It just works.  And it's really one of those cases, if ain't broke don't fix it.

We don't really look at it too much apart from that we're very lucky to have met each other so many years ago and still enjoy each other's company as much as we do.  Because, as you said, I know quite a few acts that they stay in different hotels and they won't fly on the same plane.  They don't do anything but go on stage and sing their songs and go home.  And I wouldn't care to do that.  And Graham and I have both discussed that if it ever got to the point where either one of us didn't want to do it anymore, we wouldn't do it.  I just couldn't imagine being on stage with someone I didn't care about, you know?
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Air Supply - Blue Chip Casino 2015" alt="Air Supply - Blue Chip Casino 2015" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-at-night/files/2015/11/Air-Supply-Blue-Chip-Casino-2015.jpg" width="360" height="200" /></p>
<strong>Q.  <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Air Supply website..." href="http://www.airsupplymusic.com/" target="_blank">Air Supply</a> struggled for five years before breaking through in America in 1980.  Was there a particular moment early on in your partnership with Graham where you thought you guys were really onto something?</strong>

RH:  Definitely.  We had huge success in Australia in 1976 with our first release there.  And then we came to the U.S. to open for Rod Stewart in 1977.

Then we went back to Australia and we were dead in the water.

I think there was five or seven people in the band at the time and we were getting offers to play for two hundred dollars a night.  I mean, we couldn't do it.  We couldn't pay anybody so we didn't work.

I was in Melbourne, staying with my sister and her husband, and Graham was in Adelaide, south Australia, writing some songs and I actually said to him, "I don't know whether we can keep doing this."  Because we weren't getting any offers to play.  I was singing jingles for Coke-A-Cola and Maxwell House coffee and stuff to make a living.  And he said, "We have to stick with this because we're great and we have great songs and something will happen."

So there was that very brief moment where I thought, "Well, this is not really gonna go anywhere."

But, of course, one of the songs that he had written when he was in south Australia was "Lost in Love" and it was released in Australia with a new record company and it was a big hit there.  It took two years to get from Australia to the U.S. but once it was released in America, by Clive Davis, at Arista Records, that was the beginning of this career that we have now.

<strong>Q.  Over forty years you've seen so many different changes in the music industry, whether it be musical trends like disco and grunge come and go, immense changes to radio on both the AM and FM dial, the rise of the internet or the downfall of the major label system now.  What would you say is the biggest change you've noticed during your forty years in this industry?</strong>

RH:  Definitely the internet.  It changed everything.  If you were put to sleep in 1970 and woken up again now and looked at the music business, you'd have a heart attack and die probably.

As you said, the demise of major labels.  Along with that goes support for new acts - not grooming them, specifically, but giving them a clue about what to do, how to do it, how to dress... A whole lot of advice that you had around you in those days, none of that's there anymore.  And, of course, you can record anything now in your bathroom if you've got the right equipment and it sounds great.

So there's a lot of pluses to it but I really kind of miss that atmosphere with record companies, and people that worked on your behalf and feel good.  But those days are gone, that's for sure.

<strong>Q.  Obviously in America, by the time the nineties hit, the culture here shifted away from soft rock.  Alternative music, specifically the grunge rock out of Seattle, not only influenced younger American music fans but also crossed over in terms of the pop culture as a whole.  It was a different atmosphere than the eighties where diverse genres like hair metal and soft rock could co-exist and even mingle on the American radio dial, especially in ballads.  By the nineties, soft rock became taboo here almost overnight.  During that time, it seems like you guys did a lot of international touring, presumably as a result.  Was there ever a moment where something like that, a changing trend or what not, worried you in regards to sustaining the band's future?</strong>

RH:  Not at all.  Because by the time that those changes that you just described had come into play, we already had ten hit songs and we never really looked at what was going on around us because we were too busy doing what we were doing.  And we still toured extensively in the U.S. but international things came to us on a more extensive basis.

I mean, we've had four or five careers in the last forty years and we've had success because we stuck to our guns and played the music that we played.  And we've suffered for it... because trends come and go.  But the thing now is, after forty years, I don't really care what's going on.  Because I know that we've got dates booked up until next December again now.  The future has always looked bright for us after a certain point. I don't worry about what's going on.

I don't listen to music at all really, anything current.  If I'm in my car I listen to sports talk radio and if I'm listening to music it's gonna be either the Beatles or AC/DC or the Eagles or Bee Gees or stuff that I fell in love with all those years ago.  So we just keep on doing what we're doing.

Getting back to your point about the changes - hair metal being able to coincide with soft rock and stuff - I mean, I remember the days when you could go and hang out with people that played in the opposite genre to what you were doing.  I had dinner with Ronnie James Dio a few times in Los Angeles - got along great, a beautiful person.  And then all the sudden it became a competition: "Because you're not 'cool,' we can't talk to you anymore.  You're not playing the kind of music that's popular now so we don't want to be around you.  We don't want to have that stain of being associated with you because you're not hip anymore."

And that's kind of sad.  Because the music business is one of the smallest in the universe.  I'm probably beginning to sound like I'm a really bitter old man after this interview!<em> (Laughs)</em> But I enjoyed the days when everybody got along with each other and everybody was grateful that they had a job in music and they were making a living.

I remember, it must've been in 1976 or 1977, we were touring, and we were in Melbourne, and I went down to the laundry room at two or three in the morning to do my stuff and Bon Scott was there.  And we had a chat for quite a long time.  And he was another guy that was a great, great person.  And it wasn't that "Air Supply's too soft and AC/DC's..." It was just music and we all enjoyed each other's company.

<strong>Q.  You just said the word "cool" and that's something I wanted to get to as well.  Obviously, there was a period there where it became "uncool," in America, to like something like soft rock in general.  And that's the type of thing that some of your peers, despite unthinkable success, have had kind of a hard time dealing with.  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/phil-collins-last-stand-why-the-troubled-pop-star-wants-to-call-it-quits-20110304" target="_blank">Phil Collins</a> kind of comes to mind. But it doesn't seem to bother you in the slightest.  Was there ever a time where that was difficult to handle?</strong>

RH:  Not at all.  The thing is, once 1980, '81 came, and we had four or five top ten songs, and we were kind of established at what we were doing, it never really bothered me.  Ever.  And it doesn't now.

I'm also a realist in that whatever music is popular is city hall.  And you can't fight city hall.  You've just gotta go with the flow and do your thing and not worry about it.

<strong>Q.  Twice in the past year or so, first with "Desert, Sea, Sky" and most recently with "I Want You," <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Air Supply website..." href="http://www.airsupplymusic.com/" target="_blank">Air Supply</a> has reappeared on the American charts... But on an entirely different American chart:  the Billboard Dance Music charts.  What's it like for you guys to not only shift gears and head in a different musical direction - after forty years no less - but also to experience some of your biggest American chart success in the past twenty-five years?</strong>

RH:  It's great.  It was a very pleasant surprise.  It was unexpected.  Both of those songs weren't planned - because Graham doesn't write like that.  He just writes what comes into his head.

But it's great to even imagine that in five decades we've had successful songs on some chart somewhere.  It's quite amazing.

<strong>Q.  I know you said that you don't listen to a lot of new music but, obviously, it's dance music that's huge right now, especially in America.  Your last full studio album, <em>Mumbo Jumbo</em>, was released in 2010.  Are you guys working on new music?</strong>

RH:  We just released a new song that's a little more in the vein of what people would expect from us.  It's on YouTube and you can see <a title="Click HERE to watch Air Supply's new video for &quot;I Adore You&quot; on YouTube..." href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6stvoH1zrA0" target="_blank">the video</a>.  It's called "I Adore You."

We have no plans to do an album, per se, now, mostly because of the time.  We do about 120 shows a year.  In the old days, when you could go home or go to a studio for six weeks or two months and do it, that's just not an option for us now.  So we'll keep doing what we're doing and hopefully have more success with the new song and see what happens.

As I've said a few times, we wanted to work together because we thought we had something that was very cool and sounded good.  There was no plan - we just wanted to do it!  And that's what we do now.

<strong>Q.  What would you say is Air Supply's biggest accomplishment over the past forty years?</strong>

RH:  I think the career - the body of work and the career: Being able to say that we still do what we do very well and we still tour all over the world.

We've had a career that's not only maintained itself but been successful for forty years.  I think that's the best achievement of all.

We don't really look at it too much apart from that we're very lucky to have met each other so many years ago and still enjoy each other's company as much as we do.  Because, as you said, I know quite a few acts that they stay in different hotels and they won't fly on the same plane.  They don't do anything but go on stage and sing their songs and go home.  And I wouldn't care to do that.  And Graham and I have both discussed that if it ever got to the point where either one of us didn't want to do it anymore, we wouldn't do it.  I just couldn't imagine being on stage with someone I didn't care about, you know?

<strong>Q.  <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Air Supply website..." href="http://www.airsupplymusic.com/" target="_blank">Air Supply</a> struggled for five years before breaking through in America in 1980.  Was there a particular moment early on in your partnership with Graham where you thought you guys were really onto something?</strong>

RH:  Definitely.  We had huge success in Australia in 1976 with our first release there.  And then we came to the U.S. to open for Rod Stewart in 1977.

Then we went back to Australia and we were dead in the water.

I think there was five or seven people in the band at the time and we were getting offers to play for two hundred dollars a night.  I mean, we couldn't do it.  We couldn't pay anybody so we didn't work.

I was in Melbourne, staying with my sister and her husband, and Graham was in Adelaide, south Australia, writing some songs and I actually said to him, "I don't know whether we can keep doing this."  Because we weren't getting any offers to play.  I was singing jingles for Coke-A-Cola and Maxwell House coffee and stuff to make a living.  And he said, "We have to stick with this because we're great and we have great songs and something will happen."

So there was that very brief moment where I thought, "Well, this is not really gonna go anywhere."

But, of course, one of the songs that he had written when he was in south Australia was "Lost in Love" and it was released in Australia with a new record company and it was a big hit there.  It took two years to get from Australia to the U.S. but once it was released in America, by Clive Davis, at Arista Records, that was the beginning of this career that we have now.

<strong>Q.  Over forty years you've seen so many different changes in the music industry, whether it be musical trends like disco and grunge come and go, immense changes to radio on both the AM and FM dial, the rise of the internet or the downfall of the major label system now.  What would you say is the biggest change you've noticed during your forty years in this industry?</strong>

RH:  Definitely the internet.  It changed everything.  If you were put to sleep in 1970 and woken up again now and looked at the music business, you'd have a heart attack and die probably.

As you said, the demise of major labels.  Along with that goes support for new acts - not grooming them, specifically, but giving them a clue about what to do, how to do it, how to dress... A whole lot of advice that you had around you in those days, none of that's there anymore.  And, of course, you can record anything now in your bathroom if you've got the right equipment and it sounds great.

So there's a lot of pluses to it but I really kind of miss that atmosphere with record companies, and people that worked on your behalf and feel good.  But those days are gone, that's for sure.

<strong>Q.  Obviously in America, by the time the nineties hit, the culture here shifted away from soft rock.  Alternative music, specifically the grunge rock out of Seattle, not only influenced younger American music fans but also crossed over in terms of the pop culture as a whole.  It was a different atmosphere than the eighties where diverse genres like hair metal and soft rock could co-exist and even mingle on the American radio dial, especially in ballads.  By the nineties, soft rock became taboo here almost overnight.  During that time, it seems like you guys did a lot of international touring, presumably as a result.  Was there ever a moment where something like that, a changing trend or what not, worried you in regards to sustaining the band's future?</strong>

RH:  Not at all.  Because by the time that those changes that you just described had come into play, we already had ten hit songs and we never really looked at what was going on around us because we were too busy doing what we were doing.  And we still toured extensively in the U.S. but international things came to us on a more extensive basis.

I mean, we've had four or five careers in the last forty years and we've had success because we stuck to our guns and played the music that we played.  And we've suffered for it... because trends come and go.  But the thing now is, after forty years, I don't really care what's going on.  Because I know that we've got dates booked up until next December again now.  The future has always looked bright for us after a certain point. I don't worry about what's going on.

I don't listen to music at all really, anything current.  If I'm in my car I listen to sports talk radio and if I'm listening to music it's gonna be either the Beatles or AC/DC or the Eagles or Bee Gees or stuff that I fell in love with all those years ago.  So we just keep on doing what we're doing.

Getting back to your point about the changes - hair metal being able to coincide with soft rock and stuff - I mean, I remember the days when you could go and hang out with people that played in the opposite genre to what you were doing.  I had dinner with Ronnie James Dio a few times in Los Angeles - got along great, a beautiful person.  And then all the sudden it became a competition: "Because you're not 'cool,' we can't talk to you anymore.  You're not playing the kind of music that's popular now so we don't want to be around you.  We don't want to have that stain of being associated with you because you're not hip anymore."

And that's kind of sad.  Because the music business is one of the smallest in the universe.  I'm probably beginning to sound like I'm a really bitter old man after this interview!<em> (Laughs)</em> But I enjoyed the days when everybody got along with each other and everybody was grateful that they had a job in music and they were making a living.

I remember, it must've been in 1976 or 1977, we were touring, and we were in Melbourne, and I went down to the laundry room at two or three in the morning to do my stuff and Bon Scott was there.  And we had a chat for quite a long time.  And he was another guy that was a great, great person.  And it wasn't that "Air Supply's too soft and AC/DC's..." It was just music and we all enjoyed each other's company.

<strong>Q.  You just said the word "cool" and that's something I wanted to get to as well.  Obviously, there was a period there where it became "uncool," in America, to like something like soft rock in general.  And that's the type of thing that some of your peers, despite unthinkable success, have had kind of a hard time dealing with.  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/phil-collins-last-stand-why-the-troubled-pop-star-wants-to-call-it-quits-20110304" target="_blank">Phil Collins</a> kind of comes to mind. But it doesn't seem to bother you in the slightest.  Was there ever a time where that was difficult to handle?</strong>

RH:  Not at all.  The thing is, once 1980, '81 came, and we had four or five top ten songs, and we were kind of established at what we were doing, it never really bothered me.  Ever.  And it doesn't now.

I'm also a realist in that whatever music is popular is city hall.  And you can't fight city hall.  You've just gotta go with the flow and do your thing and not worry about it.

<strong>Q.  Twice in the past year or so, first with "Desert, Sea, Sky" and most recently with "I Want You," <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Air Supply website..." href="http://www.airsupplymusic.com/" target="_blank">Air Supply</a> has reappeared on the American charts... But on an entirely different American chart:  the Billboard Dance Music charts.  What's it like for you guys to not only shift gears and head in a different musical direction - after forty years no less - but also to experience some of your biggest American chart success in the past twenty-five years?</strong>

RH:  It's great.  It was a very pleasant surprise.  It was unexpected.  Both of those songs weren't planned - because Graham doesn't write like that.  He just writes what comes into his head.

But it's great to even imagine that in five decades we've had successful songs on some chart somewhere.  It's quite amazing.

<strong>Q.  I know you said that you don't listen to a lot of new music but, obviously, it's dance music that's huge right now, especially in America.  Your last full studio album, <em>Mumbo Jumbo</em>, was released in 2010.  Are you guys working on new music?</strong>

RH:  We just released a new song that's a little more in the vein of what people would expect from us.  It's on YouTube and you can see <a title="Click HERE to watch Air Supply's new video for &quot;I Adore You&quot; on YouTube..." href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6stvoH1zrA0" target="_blank">the video</a>.  It's called "I Adore You."

We have no plans to do an album, per se, now, mostly because of the time.  We do about 120 shows a year.  In the old days, when you could go home or go to a studio for six weeks or two months and do it, that's just not an option for us now.  So we'll keep doing what we're doing and hopefully have more success with the new song and see what happens.

As I've said a few times, we wanted to work together because we thought we had something that was very cool and sounded good.  There was no plan - we just wanted to do it!  And that's what we do now.

<strong>Q.  What would you say is Air Supply's biggest accomplishment over the past forty years?</strong>

RH:  I think the career - the body of work and the career: Being able to say that we still do what we do very well and we still tour all over the world.

We've had a career that's not only maintained itself but been successful for forty years.  I think that's the best achievement of all.

Vaden Todd Lewis and the Toadies spent much of 2014 looking back at the twenty years following their 1994 breakthrough, debut album <em>Rubberneck</em>, celebrating the anniversary with a special reissue of the album and a tour that featured a full performance of it.

Following the success of their Dia De Los Toadies festival - held annually in their home state of Texas since 2008 - shaking things up on record, and on tour, the way they do on stage at home seemed like a natural progression.

One of the hallmarks of that event, which the Toadies personally curate, is what frontman Vaden Todd Lewis calls the band's "chill" set, a set that often involves taking Toadies songs down to their bare bones, reworking them, adding different instrumentation, and ultimately reinventing familiar songs in a more acoustic based manner.

As that unique set evolved over the course of eight years onstage, the band decided to try and harness that vibe in the studio which wound up resulting in the sixth Toadies studio effort <em>Heretics</em>, released this past September by Texas based independent label Kirtland Records.

Touring for <em>Heretics</em>, the band will be performing their new take on a number of familiar Toadies hits in a more acoustic setting throughout a series of smaller, more intimate venues, allowing the storytelling of songwriter and vocalist Vaden Todd Lewis to drown out the guitar for the first time on a full, national tour.

Headed to town Sunday night for a stripped down Toadies set at Double Door, I spoke with Vaden Todd Lewis about the challenge of changing up songs fans expect to hear a certain way, the influence of the state of Texas on the new <em>Heretics</em> album, the mindset that empowered the band's 1994 breakthrough <em>Rubberneck</em>, catering directly to fans in the internet age and much more.  A lightly edited transcript of that phone conversation follows below...

<strong>Q.  You guys have been on tour at home in Texas for the last week or so before expanding it a bit more next week... How has the reaction been to the new songs and the new takes on the old songs so far?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Toadies website..." href="http://thetoadies.com/" target="_blank"><em>Vaden Todd Lewis</em></a>:  Very good.  It's been a blast.  I wasn't really sure with this whole new, weird thing we're doing -  I was just not really sure how people would react to it.  Especially getting down into the country, in Texas, people are reacting and responding really well.  I was pleasantly surprised a great deal.

<strong>Q.  You've picked some pretty interesting venues for this tour - the dance halls in Texas and, even here in Chicago, the Double Door which is a pretty intimate venue.  What was your mindset when it came to putting this tour together?</strong>

VTL:  We were wanting to make it just more intimate and make it kind of a chill event.  We wanted it to be very clear from the jump that this was not a big, loud rock show.  I want to make sure that everybody's having a good time... But I want to make sure that nobody bought a ticket thinking they were gonna rock balls.  So we tried to scale it down and make it intimate and cool and chill.  We'll be playing a lot of venues that are seated.

These dance halls are really cool.  We played the oldest and the second oldest dance halls in Texas last week.  It's so cool.  I've never been to these places that are out in the country.  They're just great people and it's a great experience to be able to go in there and play.  Gruene Hall - which I believe is the oldest dance hall in Texas.  Luckenbach.  Schroeder Hall.  The Dosey Doe.  Just cool old honky tonks [and] they're thriving!  It's just crazy.  Luckenbach and Schroeder, they're way, way... It's a long ways to anything!  They're not convenient so they're there for a reason.  It's really cool.

But I've always loved playing the Double Door.  I just love that place.  It's got a good vibe and a creepy downstairs dressing room hell.  It's just awesome!  I love it.

<strong>Q.  The most striking thing upon initially listening to <em>Heretics</em> is obviously the new interpretations of Toadies songs: specifically different instrumentation and arrangements.  For example, you added mandolin and keyboards to a track like "Tyler" and completely turned it upside down.  What's the creative process like for you guys when it comes to changing up songs that fans kind of expect to hear a certain way and making them work on an album like<em> Heretics</em>?</strong>

VTL:  It was a big challenge.  This whole thing started at Dia De Los <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Toadies website..." href="http://thetoadies.com/" target="_blank">Toadies</a>.  We just did the eighth one last month.  So it's been eight years.  Around the second year, we decided we would add a "chill" set the first night and make it two nights from one.  So we stripped it down and the first year that we did it it was acoustic guitars and we just kind of had fun with it.

The next year we expanded it a little bit more where Clark [Vogeler] plays keyboards a little bit.  Then it just evolved into this way different thing.  I guess it was a year and a half ago that we were thinking, "What if we did this in a controlled environment and made a record?  That would be pretty cool - just do it where we could just go crazy with it."  So that's what happened and that's what we wound up doing.

But as far as how to change the songs, the bottom line ethic for me is... I had read somewhere when I was a kid, one of my rock heroes - who I cannot think of right now - said that a good song is a good song regardless of what you play it on:  if it's on an acoustic guitar or piano or whatever.  So when we started taking these songs apart, I thought, "Well, that's a scary proposition because if I think these songs are good, then they should stand up."  So we just started running with it that way:  How can we play these completely differently but make it something different that shines a new light on what the song is?  So that's what we've done.

<strong>Q.  You mentioned your Dia De Los Toadies festival.  Can you speak to what that's become now over the course of eight years?  I'm especially intrigued by the fact that it was born almost as homage to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnics in Austin, right?</strong>

VTL:  Totally, yeah.  It started in probably ['08].  We got together to do a couple of St. Patrick's Day and radio things.  And we've done a million of those.  I mean a million.  And they're fun because you get to play... But you don't get to play as long as you want and you don't get to pick the bands you play with.  If you're lucky, there's bands you want to see... But often times not.  You're just kind of on the bill.  And that's what you signed up for in those types of situations.  It is what it is.

So we were thinking, "What if we did something crazy and did our own festival and promoted it ourselves and picked our own bands and modeled it after Willie's picnic and just made it a thing?"  And the label and management thought that was a good idea!  So they jumped on it.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Toadies 2015" alt="Toadies 2015" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-at-night/files/2015/11/Toadies-Promo-2015-e1447437219369.jpg" width="400" height="280" /></p>
<strong>Q.  It would seem that the state of Texas is all over <em>Heretics</em> - it was born out of your more laid back sets at Dia De Los Toadies, features Black Joe Lewis's horn section and guest spots from Willie Nelson's harmonica player Mickey Raphael.  It was also released on Kirtland Records.  The state of Texas, almost without fail, unlike so many others, seems to really have an impact on the musicians and the music that comes out of it.  What kind of an effect does the state of Texas itself have for you now as a musician or has it had for you over the years?</strong>

VTL:  Jeez, that's hard to say because I'm in it.

I don't know... I've always been a big fan of ZZ Top and that kind of bluesy, shuffly sound.  It's kind of in the air here.

When I was a pre-teen and teenager, I was just into heavy metal.  Anything heavy metal - the heavier the better.  After a while, by my late teens, I started getting kind of burnt out on it and wanted a change, to hear something different.  The first thing I jumped over to was ZZ Top and The Cure - almost at the same time.  These were both things that my friends don't listen to! And that was just a springboard.

I went from there to Talking Heads and Pixies and all that stuff but still, at the root of it, is that bluesy, shuffly sound that kind of just informs the stuff I write.

<strong>Q.  One of the things I've always enjoyed about your songwriting is your ability to tell a story.  And it's something I kind of equate with so many different Texas musicians: The Reverend Horton Heat, The Old 97's, ZZ Top, Willie Nelson, all of the old country stuff.  All of those guys tell stories.  Is that idea of telling a story something that's important to you or something that you equate with a good song?</strong>

VTL:  Oh yeah.  Definitely.  I grew up on the horror classics.  Early on, I was reading Edgar Allan Poe and that freaked me out when I was a little kid.  Then I got a little older and it was Stephen King and stuff like that.  The weirder the better.

I've got very few songs that I've done that I would consider not being a story.  I love it.  I like taking somebody on a little journey.  To me, the whole idea of music is to kind of get you out of your surroundings and put you somewhere else for a little while.  I've always just loved being spirited away and I try to do that for people.

<strong>Q.  A big part of the <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Toadies website..." href="http://thetoadies.com/" target="_blank">Toadies</a> story would seem to be timing:  you guys got your start in the early nineties as alternative and grunge music started to hit and made different sounds more palatable on the radio for the first time in a long time. The Toadies didn't sound like the grunge rock out of Seattle and a radio listener then was just as likely to hear anything from Jane's Addiction or Tori Amos to R.E.M. and The Cure alongside the Toadies on the radio dial.  That period didn't last very long but, starting out, did it make it easier to make an album like <em>Rubberneck, </em>and release it in 1994, without worrying about what was "cool" or what was "marketable?"</strong>

VTL:  Well, this is gonna sound pretentious as hell but I didn't even think about that, about what was marketable.

Honestly, when we were doing <em>Rubberneck</em>, I just thought, "I have conned these guys into the biggest f---ing con that I've ever pulled off!  And they're paying us all this money to go in and record this record.  And then they have to put us on tour because... they have to!  So we'll get to see the States a little bit and then we'll go home!  And then ha ha, the joke's on you!"

That was my thinking process doing this record: "I'm gonna do exactly the record that I want to do."  Then it turned into a thing, fortunately, which was great.  But I've tried to keep that ethic going forward.  It really works for me just to get in there and not worry about what's going on outside the studio and just stay in the pocket as it were.

<strong>Q.  Once it became time to begin work on the second album, that era of uniqueness on the radio and on album was, essentially, already gone, which led to some of the issues you guys had with your label (Interscope) upon trying to get your sophomore effort <em>Feeler</em> released, initially, in 1998, before the label <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeler_%28Toadies_album%29" target="_blank">shelved it</a> (it was eventually released in 2010).  Since then, you've kind of gone out of your way to avoid major labels, releasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_Brothers" target="_blank">Burden Brothers</a> material the way you did via the web early on.  Now the Toadies are partnered with a local Texas label (Kirtland) that was founded by musicians and would certainly seem to be a bit more artist friendly.  Looking back, it would seem to me that you were way ahead of the curve with the way you started carrying your business and catering directly to your audience.  Do you feel like that kind of prepared you a bit for reuniting the Toadies in 2006 in a much different music industry landscape than what the band left after breaking up in 2001?
</strong>

VTL:  In hindsight, sure.  The boring story of that is that I started writing, like I do when I'm home, and it didn't sound like The Burden Brothers, it sounded like the Toadies.  So that's what kind of inspired that getting back together.

But, yeah, in hindsight, I guess it did just make it easier to just do what we wanted to do.  We learned so much going through the major label wringer and we continually try to watch our steps going forward.  But that makes a lot of sense, yeah.

<strong>Q.  It can obviously be a bit of a double-edged sword for a musician but what's your take on the web as an artist who has no other choice but to utilize it now.  Has it helped you to kind of eschew the major labels to some extent?</strong>

VTL:  Oh yeah.  Once the internet became, well, a thing, I realized pretty quickly that... Remember back in the day when like Metallica was suing whoever, Napster?  Or people individually?  I just thought, "That's not gonna make anybody happy.  Anybody!"  Even the bands... you're not gonna do to well out of this!  I just didn't get it. My thought was, "Well, it's the internet.  Now everything's free."  That's just the way it works.

So that's just kind of the ethic I've had.  You just have to find different ways to do what you do and make a living at it.  Fortunately, we have a good team that helps us navigate that.

Vaden Todd Lewis and the Toadies spent much of 2014 looking back at the twenty years following their 1994 breakthrough, debut album <em>Rubberneck</em>, celebrating the anniversary with a special reissue of the album and a tour that featured a full performance of it.

Following the success of their Dia De Los Toadies festival - held annually in their home state of Texas since 2008 - shaking things up on record, and on tour, the way they do on stage at home seemed like a natural progression.

One of the hallmarks of that event, which the Toadies personally curate, is what frontman Vaden Todd Lewis calls the band's "chill" set, a set that often involves taking Toadies songs down to their bare bones, reworking them, adding different instrumentation, and ultimately reinventing familiar songs in a more acoustic based manner.

As that unique set evolved over the course of eight years onstage, the band decided to try and harness that vibe in the studio which wound up resulting in the sixth Toadies studio effort <em>Heretics</em>, released this past September by Texas based independent label Kirtland Records.

Touring for <em>Heretics</em>, the band will be performing their new take on a number of familiar Toadies hits in a more acoustic setting throughout a series of smaller, more intimate venues, allowing the storytelling of songwriter and vocalist Vaden Todd Lewis to drown out the guitar for the first time on a full, national tour.

Headed to town Sunday night for a stripped down Toadies set at Double Door, I spoke with Vaden Todd Lewis about the challenge of changing up songs fans expect to hear a certain way, the influence of the state of Texas on the new <em>Heretics</em> album, the mindset that empowered the band's 1994 breakthrough <em>Rubberneck</em>, catering directly to fans in the internet age and much more.  A lightly edited transcript of that phone conversation follows below...

<strong>Q.  You guys have been on tour at home in Texas for the last week or so before expanding it a bit more next week... How has the reaction been to the new songs and the new takes on the old songs so far?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Toadies website..." href="http://thetoadies.com/" target="_blank"><em>Vaden Todd Lewis</em></a>:  Very good.  It's been a blast.  I wasn't really sure with this whole new, weird thing we're doing -  I was just not really sure how people would react to it.  Especially getting down into the country, in Texas, people are reacting and responding really well.  I was pleasantly surprised a great deal.

<strong>Q.  You've picked some pretty interesting venues for this tour - the dance halls in Texas and, even here in Chicago, the Double Door which is a pretty intimate venue.  What was your mindset when it came to putting this tour together?</strong>

VTL:  We were wanting to make it just more intimate and make it kind of a chill event.  We wanted it to be very clear from the jump that this was not a big, loud rock show.  I want to make sure that everybody's having a good time... But I want to make sure that nobody bought a ticket thinking they were gonna rock balls.  So we tried to scale it down and make it intimate and cool and chill.  We'll be playing a lot of venues that are seated.

These dance halls are really cool.  We played the oldest and the second oldest dance halls in Texas last week.  It's so cool.  I've never been to these places that are out in the country.  They're just great people and it's a great experience to be able to go in there and play.  Gruene Hall - which I believe is the oldest dance hall in Texas.  Luckenbach.  Schroeder Hall.  The Dosey Doe.  Just cool old honky tonks [and] they're thriving!  It's just crazy.  Luckenbach and Schroeder, they're way, way... It's a long ways to anything!  They're not convenient so they're there for a reason.  It's really cool.

But I've always loved playing the Double Door.  I just love that place.  It's got a good vibe and a creepy downstairs dressing room hell.  It's just awesome!  I love it.

<strong>Q.  The most striking thing upon initially listening to <em>Heretics</em> is obviously the new interpretations of Toadies songs: specifically different instrumentation and arrangements.  For example, you added mandolin and keyboards to a track like "Tyler" and completely turned it upside down.  What's the creative process like for you guys when it comes to changing up songs that fans kind of expect to hear a certain way and making them work on an album like<em> Heretics</em>?</strong>

VTL:  It was a big challenge.  This whole thing started at Dia De Los <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Toadies website..." href="http://thetoadies.com/" target="_blank">Toadies</a>.  We just did the eighth one last month.  So it's been eight years.  Around the second year, we decided we would add a "chill" set the first night and make it two nights from one.  So we stripped it down and the first year that we did it it was acoustic guitars and we just kind of had fun with it.

The next year we expanded it a little bit more where Clark [Vogeler] plays keyboards a little bit.  Then it just evolved into this way different thing.  I guess it was a year and a half ago that we were thinking, "What if we did this in a controlled environment and made a record?  That would be pretty cool - just do it where we could just go crazy with it."  So that's what happened and that's what we wound up doing.

But as far as how to change the songs, the bottom line ethic for me is... I had read somewhere when I was a kid, one of my rock heroes - who I cannot think of right now - said that a good song is a good song regardless of what you play it on:  if it's on an acoustic guitar or piano or whatever.  So when we started taking these songs apart, I thought, "Well, that's a scary proposition because if I think these songs are good, then they should stand up."  So we just started running with it that way:  How can we play these completely differently but make it something different that shines a new light on what the song is?  So that's what we've done.

<strong>Q.  You mentioned your Dia De Los Toadies festival.  Can you speak to what that's become now over the course of eight years?  I'm especially intrigued by the fact that it was born almost as homage to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnics in Austin, right?</strong>

VTL:  Totally, yeah.  It started in probably ['08].  We got together to do a couple of St. Patrick's Day and radio things.  And we've done a million of those.  I mean a million.  And they're fun because you get to play... But you don't get to play as long as you want and you don't get to pick the bands you play with.  If you're lucky, there's bands you want to see... But often times not.  You're just kind of on the bill.  And that's what you signed up for in those types of situations.  It is what it is.

So we were thinking, "What if we did something crazy and did our own festival and promoted it ourselves and picked our own bands and modeled it after Willie's picnic and just made it a thing?"  And the label and management thought that was a good idea!  So they jumped on it.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Toadies 2015" alt="Toadies 2015" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-at-night/files/2015/11/Toadies-Promo-2015-e1447437219369.jpg" width="400" height="280" /></p>
<strong>Q.  It would seem that the state of Texas is all over <em>Heretics</em> - it was born out of your more laid back sets at Dia De Los Toadies, features Black Joe Lewis's horn section and guest spots from Willie Nelson's harmonica player Mickey Raphael.  It was also released on Kirtland Records.  The state of Texas, almost without fail, unlike so many others, seems to really have an impact on the musicians and the music that comes out of it.  What kind of an effect does the state of Texas itself have for you now as a musician or has it had for you over the years?</strong>

VTL:  Jeez, that's hard to say because I'm in it.

I don't know... I've always been a big fan of ZZ Top and that kind of bluesy, shuffly sound.  It's kind of in the air here.

When I was a pre-teen and teenager, I was just into heavy metal.  Anything heavy metal - the heavier the better.  After a while, by my late teens, I started getting kind of burnt out on it and wanted a change, to hear something different.  The first thing I jumped over to was ZZ Top and The Cure - almost at the same time.  These were both things that my friends don't listen to! And that was just a springboard.

I went from there to Talking Heads and Pixies and all that stuff but still, at the root of it, is that bluesy, shuffly sound that kind of just informs the stuff I write.

<strong>Q.  One of the things I've always enjoyed about your songwriting is your ability to tell a story.  And it's something I kind of equate with so many different Texas musicians: The Reverend Horton Heat, The Old 97's, ZZ Top, Willie Nelson, all of the old country stuff.  All of those guys tell stories.  Is that idea of telling a story something that's important to you or something that you equate with a good song?</strong>

VTL:  Oh yeah.  Definitely.  I grew up on the horror classics.  Early on, I was reading Edgar Allan Poe and that freaked me out when I was a little kid.  Then I got a little older and it was Stephen King and stuff like that.  The weirder the better.

I've got very few songs that I've done that I would consider not being a story.  I love it.  I like taking somebody on a little journey.  To me, the whole idea of music is to kind of get you out of your surroundings and put you somewhere else for a little while.  I've always just loved being spirited away and I try to do that for people.

<strong>Q.  A big part of the <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Toadies website..." href="http://thetoadies.com/" target="_blank">Toadies</a> story would seem to be timing:  you guys got your start in the early nineties as alternative and grunge music started to hit and made different sounds more palatable on the radio for the first time in a long time. The Toadies didn't sound like the grunge rock out of Seattle and a radio listener then was just as likely to hear anything from Jane's Addiction or Tori Amos to R.E.M. and The Cure alongside the Toadies on the radio dial.  That period didn't last very long but, starting out, did it make it easier to make an album like <em>Rubberneck, </em>and release it in 1994, without worrying about what was "cool" or what was "marketable?"</strong>

VTL:  Well, this is gonna sound pretentious as hell but I didn't even think about that, about what was marketable.

Honestly, when we were doing <em>Rubberneck</em>, I just thought, "I have conned these guys into the biggest f---ing con that I've ever pulled off!  And they're paying us all this money to go in and record this record.  And then they have to put us on tour because... they have to!  So we'll get to see the States a little bit and then we'll go home!  And then ha ha, the joke's on you!"

That was my thinking process doing this record: "I'm gonna do exactly the record that I want to do."  Then it turned into a thing, fortunately, which was great.  But I've tried to keep that ethic going forward.  It really works for me just to get in there and not worry about what's going on outside the studio and just stay in the pocket as it were.

<strong>Q.  Once it became time to begin work on the second album, that era of uniqueness on the radio and on album was, essentially, already gone, which led to some of the issues you guys had with your label (Interscope) upon trying to get your sophomore effort <em>Feeler</em> released, initially, in 1998, before the label <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeler_%28Toadies_album%29" target="_blank">shelved it</a> (it was eventually released in 2010).  Since then, you've kind of gone out of your way to avoid major labels, releasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_Brothers" target="_blank">Burden Brothers</a> material the way you did via the web early on.  Now the Toadies are partnered with a local Texas label (Kirtland) that was founded by musicians and would certainly seem to be a bit more artist friendly.  Looking back, it would seem to me that you were way ahead of the curve with the way you started carrying your business and catering directly to your audience.  Do you feel like that kind of prepared you a bit for reuniting the Toadies in 2006 in a much different music industry landscape than what the band left after breaking up in 2001?
</strong>

VTL:  In hindsight, sure.  The boring story of that is that I started writing, like I do when I'm home, and it didn't sound like The Burden Brothers, it sounded like the Toadies.  So that's what kind of inspired that getting back together.

But, yeah, in hindsight, I guess it did just make it easier to just do what we wanted to do.  We learned so much going through the major label wringer and we continually try to watch our steps going forward.  But that makes a lot of sense, yeah.

<strong>Q.  It can obviously be a bit of a double-edged sword for a musician but what's your take on the web as an artist who has no other choice but to utilize it now.  Has it helped you to kind of eschew the major labels to some extent?</strong>

VTL:  Oh yeah.  Once the internet became, well, a thing, I realized pretty quickly that... Remember back in the day when like Metallica was suing whoever, Napster?  Or people individually?  I just thought, "That's not gonna make anybody happy.  Anybody!"  Even the bands... you're not gonna do to well out of this!  I just didn't get it. My thought was, "Well, it's the internet.  Now everything's free."  That's just the way it works.

So that's just kind of the ethic I've had.  You just have to find different ways to do what you do and make a living at it.  Fortunately, we have a good team that helps us navigate that.

In his chronicling of the somewhat ridiculous Thanksgiving 1965 events that laid the foundation for one of his biggest hits, "Alice's Restaurant Massacree," Arlo Guthrie created a pop music anomaly the likes of which we'll probably never see again: a hit despite it's running time of nearly nineteen minutes.

In his inimitable way, one no doubt influenced by the folk tradition passed onto him by his famous father Woody Guthrie, Arlo Guthrie struck a chord with <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> in 1967, his debut album, particularly in the relatable truth he spoke on the album's epic first track.

But the long track could be difficult to perform live.  Arlo didn't attempt it at Woodstock, despite the fact that an <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> film was set for release only days later, and, eventually, as it became bogged down by nostalgia, he'd perform it only every ten years to commemorate it's continually unthinkable longevity upon each passing anniversary.

As the events that inspired the track turn fifty, Guthrie, 68, celebrates it, once again, for the first time in nearly ten years with a fiftieth anniversary tour that brings him to the Harris Theater Sunday night (a benefit for the Old Town School of Folk Music).  I conversed with Arlo Guthrie via email about the enduring legacy of <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> as a Thanksgiving day staple, celebrating the musical legacy that was passed down to him by his father with his own kids on this tour, the idea of activism in music, his close connections to the city of Chicago over the course of the last fifty years and more.  A lightly edited transcript of that email exchange follows below...

<strong>Q. I read an interview you gave <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arlo-guthrie-looks-back-on-50-years-of-alices-restaurant-20141126" target="_blank">to Rolling Stone</a> last year where you said, "My father told me once when I was very young, 'Music will be your best friend. Learn to play the guitar. Music will be your best friend.'" On this current tour, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of "Alice's Restaurant Massacree," your son is part of your band and your daughter is opening each show. What has it been like to celebrate the musical tradition that your father passed down to you each night on stage now with your own children?</strong>

<a title="Visit the official Arlo Guthrie website..." href="http://www.arlo.net/" target="_blank"><em>Arlo Guthrie</em></a>: My kids have all grown up, so now I don’t really relate to them as kids. They are really good at what they do and I love having them there because of that.  Of course, there’s still some moments each day when I get to be a dad, and they get to be my kids.

We have toured a few times as a family and I loved those shows, especially because I get to see them and their kids understand a little more of what it is we do. My father dreamed that he could haul his family around and tour together - We’re living that dream.

<strong>Q. You've frequently described "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" as something along the lines of telling the story of "the little guy against a big world." With so much talk of an eroding middle class in America, does that concept of the fight of the little guy against a big world give the song new meaning in 2015 and help elevate this series of fiftieth anniversary performances beyond mere nostalgia?</strong>

AG: There’s always someone who knows more and someone else who knows less: Has more, has less, is bigger, and smaller, more able, less able - In other words each of us stands somewhere along the edge of this globe and no matter which way you turn there will always be as many ahead and as many behind. That’s the way it is, and [the way it's] supposed to be.

I’ve always tried to sing the kinds of songs, and tell the kinds of tales, that get everyone feeling better about the way things are, and how to make it better for everybody. It’s an inheritance I treasure.

<strong>Q. Obviously there's a bit of nostalgia that feeds into the audience desire to hear a song like "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" again and again, which I realize can be difficult for an artist looking to push forward to reconcile. Does playing it less - you only perform it live now every ten years - allow you to still have some fun with it when you perform it live?</strong>

AG: Absolutely.  YES. I remember the day when I realized that I was no longer singing it for the first time to an audience. I thought to myself - "From now on, it’s nostalgia. Better make it good."

<strong>Q. You've really developed this fiftieth anniversary tour to embrace elements of the live performance that are more closely acquainted with rock and roll than they are with live folk music: the lights, the array of photos and other multimedia elements. What's it been like after all these years to suddenly shake up the live set like that by incorporating so much new technology?</strong>

AG: I’ve always thought of folk music as being the social media we’ve used for the last 30,000 years. What I don’t like is when you add all the glitz and sparkles to a piece of crap - a song not worth hearing, and dance not worth seeing.  Stuff like that.

Too often these days, shows have a lot of new technology because that’s the only thing it’s got going for it. That said, I’m sure my stuff is not worth going to for everybody. But, for those who find it worthwhile in the first place, the new technology has hopefully not detracted from the experience.

On the other hand, every so often I’ll grab a guitar or two, hop a plane over the pond, and do a little tour of just a guy and a guitar in a place hardly anyone knows me. I do love that and it keeps it honest.

<strong>Q. What would you have said if someone told you in 1965 that you'd be singing a song about the events of that Thanksgiving fifty years later?</strong>

AG: I’d have said “Buy me a drink."

<strong>Q. I know that the song isn't a part of your own personal, Thanksgiving tradition but it obviously is to many, many people. What does the Thanksgiving holiday mean to you?</strong>

AG: Thanksgiving is family time for us. I stay home, the kids invade the kitchen, and we enjoy the memories sitting around the fireplace. Very old school.

We usually do that the day before the holiday, so that on the actual holiday we can be free to go down to the church (yeah, <a title="For more info visit the official Guthrie Center At The Old Trinity Church website..." href="https://guthriecenter.org/about/" target="_blank">that church</a>) and lend a hand for our annual Thanksgiving dinner there.

<strong>Q. When asked <a href="http://www.pbs.org/americanrootsmusic/pbs_arm_oralh_arloguthrie.html" target="_blank">by PBS</a> about Lead Belly, you said, of what was then beginning to become the music industry, "With the advent of radio and recording, music became an industry rather than just a tradition..." Fast forward to 2015 and artists are now decrying the fall of that industry as the internet continues to become not just the primary conduit of music to fans but the primary means of affordably creating and recording music for musicians. One can say a lot about the internet pro and con but it has certainly prioritized ease of access to any and all music across the expanse of its recorded history. Do you think that's helping people to discover and embrace music tradition again?</strong>

AG: For most of the gazillion musicians, bands and groups, becoming a big success is a failed dream in progress. Maybe one out a million will achieve some commercial success. Of those that become a household name, most will be broke soon enough. It comes and goes very quickly.

Most musicians I know personally just love playing - They’d be willing to pay to be able to play. That doesn’t mean some huge mega-corporation should screw them out of what is rightfully their's. The best thing that’s happened is the ability to create recordings yourself. At least you can get that far without being screwed.

There’s different kinds of entertainers also. Some use what they’ve learned to become famous. Others are happy enough just sitting around anonymously with friends swapping songs. And there’s everything in between. I was one of the latter ones, happy just playing with friends - Then I became "somebody" by accident.

I never fit in well with the industrial part of music. So, in [the] early 1980’s, I left the corporate entertainment industry and started my own own record company - so I could make the kinds of records I liked. It’s been great since then.

<strong>Q. You testified in the "Chicago Seven" trial (even though you weren't present for the events that precipitated it). One of your biggest hits was a cover of "City of New Orleans" by Steve Goodman, a Chicagoan, which you discovered upon meeting him at the Quiet Knight. You, as well as your father, both recorded interviews with Studs Terkel. You've been on festival bills with Chicago artists like Wilco, who put some of your father's lyrics to music on the <em>Mermaid Avenue</em> albums. Suffice it to say, your history in and connections to the city of Chicago would seem to run pretty deep. What does the city of Chicago mean to you after all these years and is there a particularly fond moment that sticks out for you in your experiences here?</strong>

AG: One of my very first gigs was at <a href="http://bigfishink.com/?p=5545" target="_blank">Richard Harding</a>'s place on Sedgwick, Poor Richard's. I was about eighteen years old and began a long association with him and the friends I met through him.

Studs Terkel was a friend of my father's, and he asked me to come talk with him on his radio show. All I remember was that Studs kept wanting to talk about my dad. Out of respect for him, I did. But, being “Woody’s boy” wore thin after a while.

But I loved that man dearly and, after a few years of coming back to town, I began to feel like myself when talking with him. I never had a problem being Woody’s boy anyway. If anything, I loved my dad's thoughts, what he sang about and worked for. I carry that as best as I am able even to this day.

<strong>Q. The idea of activism in song is certainly one that denotes much of your father's work. As is the idea of truth - one which, on the surface, lyrically, is quite possibly the most easily apparent element of "Alice's Restaurant Massacree." In the sixties, those ideas of truth and activism in song drove music to define the popular culture of the time. That's no longer the case and the idea of speaking out politically in song can carry with it severe career <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Chicks" target="_blank">repercussions</a>. Does music still have the power to change the world in 2015?</strong>

AG: Speaking the truth and being truthful are two different things.

For me, I keep it simple. Without love, truth is empty. Without compassion, truth is self-centered.

A sense of humor, an open heart, and an eager smile are enough for me - Even if it doesn’t change the world, it will change you.  And that changes your world.

In his chronicling of the somewhat ridiculous Thanksgiving 1965 events that laid the foundation for one of his biggest hits, "Alice's Restaurant Massacree," Arlo Guthrie created a pop music anomaly the likes of which we'll probably never see again: a hit despite it's running time of nearly nineteen minutes.

In his inimitable way, one no doubt influenced by the folk tradition passed onto him by his famous father Woody Guthrie, Arlo Guthrie struck a chord with <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> in 1967, his debut album, particularly in the relatable truth he spoke on the album's epic first track.

But the long track could be difficult to perform live.  Arlo didn't attempt it at Woodstock, despite the fact that an <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> film was set for release only days later, and, eventually, as it became bogged down by nostalgia, he'd perform it only every ten years to commemorate it's continually unthinkable longevity upon each passing anniversary.

As the events that inspired the track turn fifty, Guthrie, 68, celebrates it, once again, for the first time in nearly ten years with a fiftieth anniversary tour that brings him to the Harris Theater Sunday night (a benefit for the Old Town School of Folk Music).  I conversed with Arlo Guthrie via email about the enduring legacy of <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> as a Thanksgiving day staple, celebrating the musical legacy that was passed down to him by his father with his own kids on this tour, the idea of activism in music, his close connections to the city of Chicago over the course of the last fifty years and more.  A lightly edited transcript of that email exchange follows below...

<strong>Q. I read an interview you gave <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/arlo-guthrie-looks-back-on-50-years-of-alices-restaurant-20141126" target="_blank">to Rolling Stone</a> last year where you said, "My father told me once when I was very young, 'Music will be your best friend. Learn to play the guitar. Music will be your best friend.'" On this current tour, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of "Alice's Restaurant Massacree," your son is part of your band and your daughter is opening each show. What has it been like to celebrate the musical tradition that your father passed down to you each night on stage now with your own children?</strong>

<a title="Visit the official Arlo Guthrie website..." href="http://www.arlo.net/" target="_blank"><em>Arlo Guthrie</em></a>: My kids have all grown up, so now I don’t really relate to them as kids. They are really good at what they do and I love having them there because of that.  Of course, there’s still some moments each day when I get to be a dad, and they get to be my kids.

We have toured a few times as a family and I loved those shows, especially because I get to see them and their kids understand a little more of what it is we do. My father dreamed that he could haul his family around and tour together - We’re living that dream.

<strong>Q. You've frequently described "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" as something along the lines of telling the story of "the little guy against a big world." With so much talk of an eroding middle class in America, does that concept of the fight of the little guy against a big world give the song new meaning in 2015 and help elevate this series of fiftieth anniversary performances beyond mere nostalgia?</strong>

AG: There’s always someone who knows more and someone else who knows less: Has more, has less, is bigger, and smaller, more able, less able - In other words each of us stands somewhere along the edge of this globe and no matter which way you turn there will always be as many ahead and as many behind. That’s the way it is, and [the way it's] supposed to be.

I’ve always tried to sing the kinds of songs, and tell the kinds of tales, that get everyone feeling better about the way things are, and how to make it better for everybody. It’s an inheritance I treasure.

<strong>Q. Obviously there's a bit of nostalgia that feeds into the audience desire to hear a song like "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" again and again, which I realize can be difficult for an artist looking to push forward to reconcile. Does playing it less - you only perform it live now every ten years - allow you to still have some fun with it when you perform it live?</strong>

AG: Absolutely.  YES. I remember the day when I realized that I was no longer singing it for the first time to an audience. I thought to myself - "From now on, it’s nostalgia. Better make it good."

<strong>Q. You've really developed this fiftieth anniversary tour to embrace elements of the live performance that are more closely acquainted with rock and roll than they are with live folk music: the lights, the array of photos and other multimedia elements. What's it been like after all these years to suddenly shake up the live set like that by incorporating so much new technology?</strong>

AG: I’ve always thought of folk music as being the social media we’ve used for the last 30,000 years. What I don’t like is when you add all the glitz and sparkles to a piece of crap - a song not worth hearing, and dance not worth seeing.  Stuff like that.

Too often these days, shows have a lot of new technology because that’s the only thing it’s got going for it. That said, I’m sure my stuff is not worth going to for everybody. But, for those who find it worthwhile in the first place, the new technology has hopefully not detracted from the experience.

On the other hand, every so often I’ll grab a guitar or two, hop a plane over the pond, and do a little tour of just a guy and a guitar in a place hardly anyone knows me. I do love that and it keeps it honest.

<strong>Q. What would you have said if someone told you in 1965 that you'd be singing a song about the events of that Thanksgiving fifty years later?</strong>

AG: I’d have said “Buy me a drink."

<strong>Q. I know that the song isn't a part of your own personal, Thanksgiving tradition but it obviously is to many, many people. What does the Thanksgiving holiday mean to you?</strong>

AG: Thanksgiving is family time for us. I stay home, the kids invade the kitchen, and we enjoy the memories sitting around the fireplace. Very old school.

We usually do that the day before the holiday, so that on the actual holiday we can be free to go down to the church (yeah, <a title="For more info visit the official Guthrie Center At The Old Trinity Church website..." href="https://guthriecenter.org/about/" target="_blank">that church</a>) and lend a hand for our annual Thanksgiving dinner there.

<strong>Q. When asked <a href="http://www.pbs.org/americanrootsmusic/pbs_arm_oralh_arloguthrie.html" target="_blank">by PBS</a> about Lead Belly, you said, of what was then beginning to become the music industry, "With the advent of radio and recording, music became an industry rather than just a tradition..." Fast forward to 2015 and artists are now decrying the fall of that industry as the internet continues to become not just the primary conduit of music to fans but the primary means of affordably creating and recording music for musicians. One can say a lot about the internet pro and con but it has certainly prioritized ease of access to any and all music across the expanse of its recorded history. Do you think that's helping people to discover and embrace music tradition again?</strong>

AG: For most of the gazillion musicians, bands and groups, becoming a big success is a failed dream in progress. Maybe one out a million will achieve some commercial success. Of those that become a household name, most will be broke soon enough. It comes and goes very quickly.

Most musicians I know personally just love playing - They’d be willing to pay to be able to play. That doesn’t mean some huge mega-corporation should screw them out of what is rightfully their's. The best thing that’s happened is the ability to create recordings yourself. At least you can get that far without being screwed.

There’s different kinds of entertainers also. Some use what they’ve learned to become famous. Others are happy enough just sitting around anonymously with friends swapping songs. And there’s everything in between. I was one of the latter ones, happy just playing with friends - Then I became "somebody" by accident.

I never fit in well with the industrial part of music. So, in [the] early 1980’s, I left the corporate entertainment industry and started my own own record company - so I could make the kinds of records I liked. It’s been great since then.

<strong>Q. You testified in the "Chicago Seven" trial (even though you weren't present for the events that precipitated it). One of your biggest hits was a cover of "City of New Orleans" by Steve Goodman, a Chicagoan, which you discovered upon meeting him at the Quiet Knight. You, as well as your father, both recorded interviews with Studs Terkel. You've been on festival bills with Chicago artists like Wilco, who put some of your father's lyrics to music on the <em>Mermaid Avenue</em> albums. Suffice it to say, your history in and connections to the city of Chicago would seem to run pretty deep. What does the city of Chicago mean to you after all these years and is there a particularly fond moment that sticks out for you in your experiences here?</strong>

AG: One of my very first gigs was at <a href="http://bigfishink.com/?p=5545" target="_blank">Richard Harding</a>'s place on Sedgwick, Poor Richard's. I was about eighteen years old and began a long association with him and the friends I met through him.

Studs Terkel was a friend of my father's, and he asked me to come talk with him on his radio show. All I remember was that Studs kept wanting to talk about my dad. Out of respect for him, I did. But, being “Woody’s boy” wore thin after a while.

But I loved that man dearly and, after a few years of coming back to town, I began to feel like myself when talking with him. I never had a problem being Woody’s boy anyway. If anything, I loved my dad's thoughts, what he sang about and worked for. I carry that as best as I am able even to this day.

<strong>Q. The idea of activism in song is certainly one that denotes much of your father's work. As is the idea of truth - one which, on the surface, lyrically, is quite possibly the most easily apparent element of "Alice's Restaurant Massacree."

<!--more-->

When it comes to making music, one of the biggest challenges to Steve Marker, as both a producer and guitarist, is how to ensure the music sounds different.

In their work over the course of the past twenty years, Garbage has consistently managed that largely by refusing to look back, setting themselves apart from many of their nineties alternative peers in the process.

So it's rare to catch the band on a tour like the one that brings them to a sold out Riviera Saturday night - one which celebrates the occasion of their twentieth anniversary via a full performance of the fifteen songs which encompass their self-titled, 1995 debut album.

Despite the brief shot of nostalgia, new music is on the horizon with the possibility of their sixth studio album coming as soon as this May.  A journey into the world of self-release with their 2012 effort <em>Not Your Kind of People</em> seems to have empowered the band, freeing them up to create on their own terms, a liberating experience which continues to influence them during the latest Garbage recording sessions.

I spoke with producer and Garbage guitarist Steve Marker over the phone about the strange process of looking back at their debut album twenty years after its release, what allows that album to remain fresh and relevant, its legacy, the importance, in a continually changing music landscape, of being different and the surreal experience of walking into a near riot outside the Aragon Ballroom on the infamous December night of the live pairing of Sonic Youth with Public Enemy.  What follows below is an unedited transcript of that conversation...

<strong>Q.  You guys strike me very much as a band which typically prefers to move forward.  What’s it like looking back now at the twenty years following your 1995 debut album?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Garbage website..." href="https://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank"><em>Steve Marker</em></a>:  It is a little odd. Over the years, I've always been a lot more interested in the next thing - what the next song's gonna be or what our next album's gonna be like. Sometimes when you put an album out and you go on the road - sometimes it was up for two years that we'd tour - you're definitely ready to move on.

So you're right: Looking back, in a somewhat nostaglic way, is a little odd... but also really fun. Because a lot of the stuff that we're playing, we've never played before. When we had to go back and figure out "What the hell did I do in the studio there, twenty years ago, to get that sound? I have no idea." It was pretty late at night if you know what I'm saying!

So it's been an interesting exercise. And a lot of fun. We're kind of trying to be pretty true to how the first record sounded - probably more than we ever did in the past. It's just been kind of interesting. Because the technology's all different and the equipment's all different. I think it's gonna be pretty cool... I hope!

<strong>Q.  In looking back at the album, and re-learning songs you've never performed live, was there anything during that process that surprised you?</strong>

Marker:  Yeah. Some of the guitar parts that I did, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how they went. Like any kid would do, sitting down and trying to figure something out off the radio, I'd have to sit down with the tape playing a section over and over going, "How did I do that?" So that was surprising.

I don't feel like I ever got sick of our earlier stuff.  But some of the stuff we've never played and some of the stuff we've played well over a thousand times in concert.  I never got tired of them but maybe you get complacent with them. I guess there's a bit of trying to remember what the original spirit was behind making it in the first place and using that in the sort of new interpretation that we're trying to come up with for this tour.

That was interesting. Instead of just being like, "Well, I remember what I did last summer on the festival circuit when we played 'Stupid Girl,' so I'll just do that again" it was more like going back thinking, "Where we were we at mentally when we did this?" And equipment wise. And sonically. And we'd kind of start from there when we started rehearsing these songs.

I guess you forget how sometimes I actually did think that some of what we did was kind of damn cool, you know? It turned out really well. And maybe you forget that a little bit. We're all sort of self-deprecating a little bit and maybe don't give ourselves enough credit sometimes. So it's kind of fun to sit down and turn that up and think, "You know, that's a pretty good album!"

<strong>Q.  The idea of performing an album in its entirety to celebrate an anniversary is a popular concept at the moment, especially amongst your nineties alternative peers. But, to me, the difference with this album is the way it has endured – it still sounds pretty fresh.  It doesn’t sound dated. What do you attribute that to?</strong>

Marker:  We made it in Madison, Wisconsin and there was barely the internet. There was MTV. And there was [Chicago radio station] XRT. And the Madison stations. But we weren't like in the middle of lower Manhattan or in Hollywood listening to what everybody else was doing and trying to keep up with that. We were sort of bumbling along and doing our own thing. We weren't too worried about fitting in I guess. So maybe that was good.

There's some stuff we did that, maybe, was difficult for the times. We were using the guitars and the drum machines and the sampling, and starting to use Pro Tools, and trying to do it with pop melodies... And, for whatever reason, that combination worked out for us. I don't think that we were that worried about what the latest drum sound was. And we didn't have the latest samplers for the time.

I guess the answer is, I have no idea! But I'm grateful that you say that. Sometimes you hear something and go, "Oh that's that 1986 snare drum sound." And it is dated immediately. We, luckily, through partial incompetence and ignorance avoided that a little bit in some way.

<strong>Q.  What do you feel like the legacy of the debut <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Garbage website..." href="https://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank">Garbage</a> album is now or what do you hope it will become?</strong>

Marker:  I guess its legacy is that twenty years later we're able to go out and play it for people and they'll still show up and be interested in it. I guess that's kind of a legacy - and one that we're really grateful for.

It's not the "I Have a Dream" speech or something of that significance. But it played a part in people's lives I think. That's what they tell us now. And it meant something to them - it still does in a lot of cases. And I think we have to honor that and be grateful for it. I know I am.

<strong>Q.  You guys self-released your last album in 2012, a first for Garbage.  It’s easier to self-release than ever before but, at the same time, I would imagine it also brings about a lot more concerns for the band too. What was that self-release experience like for you guys and what kind of an impact do you think it will have on the band moving forward?</strong>

Marker:  I think it's been incredibly liberating. Basically, everybody says this - because radio has changed and the culture has changed - and bands like us are not gonna be, necessarily, on a major label. And that's just how it is. And it's been really good for us.

We don't have anybody telling us to do anything we don't want to do. In the past, we had to make videos and had to compromise. It's always your money you're spending but [label] people say, "You really have to work with this video director today! Or this remixer. And you're gonna pay for it but you really have to do it or..." And we don't get that anymore.

It's really great. If there's someone we want to work with - a photographer say, whatever it is, or we want to tour somewhere - we can kind of just say we want to do that and try to make it happen. It's kind of cutting out the middle man. We sell less records but we make more on each record. So in a way it's really good for us.

We never really enjoyed being directed that much. I think we were a little bit older and a little bit more savvy when we started out than maybe some people. So we didn't take kindly to being told what to do by labels and that's kind of led to a lot of our problems on the business end. We ended up going through a few different labels and things like that. And it's nice to just be clear of that. We can succeed or fail on our own terms and it's a much healthier place to be mentally.

<strong>Q.  There’s been some new songs here and there over the last few years, especially with the Record Store Day releases, but are you guys working on more new music?</strong>

Marker:  We sure are. We spent about a year and a half of me coming back and forth to L.A. We've been recording in [producer and Garbage drummer] Butch Vig's basement and various studios. We have a new album, that I don't know the title to yet, but it's gonna be out probably in May. It's pretty much almost ready to be mixed.

This twentieth anniversary thing is almost like a little interlude before we get to next year. We're hoping to be touring a lot next year playing completely different stuff with a new album, marching forward.

<strong>Q.  When it comes to making new <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Garbage website..." href="https://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank">Garbage</a> music in 2015, in a music industry landscape that has moved further and further from the idea of the traditional, full album release in the twenty years since your debut, what is Garbage's current approach to new music:  Do you still think in terms of the album, and making an artistic statement in that manner, or has that become less important to you guys?</strong>

Marker:  I think the album is, in an old fashioned sense, back. More like the way things were when I was a kid probably. Which I love. I listened to both sides of vinyl when I was growing up more than single songs on the radio.

Back in the day, even when we were making the early albums, there were still people that would put money into what we were doing and were really hoping that we would come up with the next number one single. And it's kind of hard to get that out of your mind, even if you say you don't care about that. They still would be really, really happy to see that number one single. And, now, we're not gonna have a number one single. Because we're not Rihanna - don't want to be. So, cool. That's great.

In a way, that lifts a lot off your shoulders and kind of frees you up to do stuff. Like on this [new] album, there's one or two songs that are really long - they're not single length. They're more like seven or eight minutes. And it doesn't matter. If that's what we feel like works on the album, that's what we'll do.

<strong>Q.  I’ve heard you say that one of the most important things to you as a producer is to create something that sounds different. In today’s music culture, there’s not a lot breaking through right now that sounds different. How important is that idea of being different to you guys when it comes to getting together and working on new Garbage music?</strong>

Marker:  I think it's more of a concern than ever. To me, the way recording has gone - and we do it too - but everybody can kind of do anything on their laptop now. There's a lot of really standard building blocks that people use to make songs. I listen to electronic music... but there's a lot of people using all the same instruments and the same beats and the same drum machines and I think there's a lot of boring things going on because of that.

Sonically, I don't hear a lot of interesting things. Like, in the seventies, if you had Roxy Music playing a pop song, it was gonna sound pretty damn weird. Or if [Brian] Eno is doing something on a production. Things like that. You'd even hear stuff on "Top 40" radio that would sound pretty weird. That's the kind of thing that I love.

I'd hate to think that things get kind of samey. We're maybe not blazing the trails of new sonic frontiers... but we're trying to. We're trying to make things sound interesting to us. And different. To me, that's one of the most important things when I hear something on the radio or on a record.

<strong>Q.  Over the course of the last twenty years, Garbage has played an awful lot in Chicago – whether it’s your own tours, radio station gigs, opening for acts like U2, etc.  I saw an interview where you told a story about seeing a Public Enemy/Sonic Youth show here and it made me curious if there are any particularly fond memories of Chicago that stick out for you in terms of performing with Garbage in Chicago…</strong>

Marker:  Before Garbage even, we were all in bands that played at the Cubby Bear. I was like a roadie for Butch and [Garbage multi-instrumentalist] Duke [Erikson] and their band and they would play the Cubby Bear almost once a month. Avalon was another one. And up and down Clark Street.

But, man... <a title="More on the 1990 riot outside the Aragon at the Chicago Reader..." href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/fighting-the-power/Content?oid=876972" target="_blank">that riot</a> at the Public Enemy/<a title="More on the 1990 riot at the official Sonic Youth website..." href="http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/cc/122990.html" target="_blank">Sonic Youth</a> show. Somebody [must have] called something in to the police and just about every Chicago cop was outside when we came out. It was like, they started this riot. There was nothing going on in the crowd [during the concert]. It was weird... rap was like really dangerous then. Like all these indie kids form Evanston were gonna come down and mix with these rap guys from the south side? This is gonna be like West Side Story or something?

And there was like 100 cop cars with their lights on outside of the show. And we kind of had to run to get out of there. The Aragon I think?
But that <a title="Read the Chicago Tribune's 1990 review of the Sonic Youth/Public Enemy concert at the Aragon Ballroom..." href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-01-01/features/9101010058_1_public-enemy-sonic-youth-flavor-flav" target="_blank">combination of music</a> was obviously something that struck me real hard - the beats and that sort of in your face sound combined with the dreamy guitars. It's kind of obvious but it was such a powerful idea at the time.

So that probably sticks out for me the most of a Chicago show.

<!--more-->

When it comes to making music, one of the biggest challenges to Steve Marker, as both a producer and guitarist, is how to ensure the music sounds different.

In their work over the course of the past twenty years, Garbage has consistently managed that largely by refusing to look back, setting themselves apart from many of their nineties alternative peers in the process.

So it's rare to catch the band on a tour like the one that brings them to a sold out Riviera Saturday night - one which celebrates the occasion of their twentieth anniversary via a full performance of the fifteen songs which encompass their self-titled, 1995 debut album.

Despite the brief shot of nostalgia, new music is on the horizon with the possibility of their sixth studio album coming as soon as this May.  A journey into the world of self-release with their 2012 effort <em>Not Your Kind of People</em> seems to have empowered the band, freeing them up to create on their own terms, a liberating experience which continues to influence them during the latest Garbage recording sessions.

I spoke with producer and Garbage guitarist Steve Marker over the phone about the strange process of looking back at their debut album twenty years after its release, what allows that album to remain fresh and relevant, its legacy, the importance, in a continually changing music landscape, of being different and the surreal experience of walking into a near riot outside the Aragon Ballroom on the infamous December night of the live pairing of Sonic Youth with Public Enemy.  What follows below is an unedited transcript of that conversation...

<strong>Q.  You guys strike me very much as a band which typically prefers to move forward.  What’s it like looking back now at the twenty years following your 1995 debut album?</strong>

<a title="Click HERE to visit the official Garbage website..." href="https://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank"><em>Steve Marker</em></a>:  It is a little odd. Over the years, I've always been a lot more interested in the next thing - what the next song's gonna be or what our next album's gonna be like. Sometimes when you put an album out and you go on the road - sometimes it was up for two years that we'd tour - you're definitely ready to move on.

So you're right: Looking back, in a somewhat nostaglic way, is a little odd... but also really fun. Because a lot of the stuff that we're playing, we've never played before. When we had to go back and figure out "What the hell did I do in the studio there, twenty years ago, to get that sound? I have no idea." It was pretty late at night if you know what I'm saying!

So it's been an interesting exercise. And a lot of fun. We're kind of trying to be pretty true to how the first record sounded - probably more than we ever did in the past. It's just been kind of interesting. Because the technology's all different and the equipment's all different. I think it's gonna be pretty cool... I hope!

<strong>Q.  In looking back at the album, and re-learning songs you've never performed live, was there anything during that process that surprised you?</strong>

Marker:  Yeah. Some of the guitar parts that I did, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how they went. Like any kid would do, sitting down and trying to figure something out off the radio, I'd have to sit down with the tape playing a section over and over going, "How did I do that?" So that was surprising.

I don't feel like I ever got sick of our earlier stuff.  But some of the stuff we've never played and some of the stuff we've played well over a thousand times in concert.  I never got tired of them but maybe you get complacent with them. I guess there's a bit of trying to remember what the original spirit was behind making it in the first place and using that in the sort of new interpretation that we're trying to come up with for this tour.

That was interesting. Instead of just being like, "Well, I remember what I did last summer on the festival circuit when we played 'Stupid Girl,' so I'll just do that again" it was more like going back thinking, "Where we were we at mentally when we did this?" And equipment wise. And sonically. And we'd kind of start from there when we started rehearsing these songs.

I guess you forget how sometimes I actually did think that some of what we did was kind of damn cool, you know? It turned out really well. And maybe you forget that a little bit. We're all sort of self-deprecating a little bit and maybe don't give ourselves enough credit sometimes. So it's kind of fun to sit down and turn that up and think, "You know, that's a pretty good album!"

<strong>Q.  The idea of performing an album in its entirety to celebrate an anniversary is a popular concept at the moment, especially amongst your nineties alternative peers. But, to me, the difference with this album is the way it has endured – it still sounds pretty fresh.  It doesn’t sound dated. What do you attribute that to?</strong>

Marker:  We made it in Madison, Wisconsin and there was barely the internet. There was MTV. And there was [Chicago radio station] XRT. And the Madison stations. But we weren't like in the middle of lower Manhattan or in Hollywood listening to what everybody else was doing and trying to keep up with that. We were sort of bumbling along and doing our own thing. We weren't too worried about fitting in I guess. So maybe that was good.

There's some stuff we did that, maybe, was difficult for the times. We were using the guitars and the drum machines and the sampling, and starting to use Pro Tools, and trying to do it with pop melodies... And, for whatever reason, that combination worked out for us. I don't think that we were that worried about what the latest drum sound was. And we didn't have the latest samplers for the time.

I guess the answer is, I have no idea! But I'm grateful that you say that. Sometimes you hear something and go, "Oh that's that 1986 snare drum sound." And it is dated immediately. We, luckily, through partial incompetence and ignorance avoided that a little bit in some way.

<strong>Q.  What do you feel like the legacy of the debut <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Garbage website..." href="https://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank">Garbage</a> album is now or what do you hope it will become?</strong>

Marker:  I guess its legacy is that twenty years later we're able to go out and play it for people and they'll still show up and be interested in it. I guess that's kind of a legacy - and one that we're really grateful for.

It's not the "I Have a Dream" speech or something of that significance. But it played a part in people's lives I think. That's what they tell us now. And it meant something to them - it still does in a lot of cases. And I think we have to honor that and be grateful for it. I know I am.

<strong>Q.  You guys self-released your last album in 2012, a first for Garbage.  It’s easier to self-release than ever before but, at the same time, I would imagine it also brings about a lot more concerns for the band too. What was that self-release experience like for you guys and what kind of an impact do you think it will have on the band moving forward?</strong>

Marker:  I think it's been incredibly liberating. Basically, everybody says this - because radio has changed and the culture has changed - and bands like us are not gonna be, necessarily, on a major label. And that's just how it is. And it's been really good for us.

We don't have anybody telling us to do anything we don't want to do. In the past, we had to make videos and had to compromise. It's always your money you're spending but [label] people say, "You really have to work with this video director today! Or this remixer. And you're gonna pay for it but you really have to do it or..." And we don't get that anymore.

It's really great. If there's someone we want to work with - a photographer say, whatever it is, or we want to tour somewhere - we can kind of just say we want to do that and try to make it happen. It's kind of cutting out the middle man. We sell less records but we make more on each record. So in a way it's really good for us.

We never really enjoyed being directed that much. I think we were a little bit older and a little bit more savvy when we started out than maybe some people. So we didn't take kindly to being told what to do by labels and that's kind of led to a lot of our problems on the business end. We ended up going through a few different labels and things like that. And it's nice to just be clear of that. We can succeed or fail on our own terms and it's a much healthier place to be mentally.

<strong>Q.  There’s been some new songs here and there over the last few years, especially with the Record Store Day releases, but are you guys working on more new music?</strong>

Marker:  We sure are. We spent about a year and a half of me coming back and forth to L.A. We've been recording in [producer and Garbage drummer] Butch Vig's basement and various studios. We have a new album, that I don't know the title to yet, but it's gonna be out probably in May. It's pretty much almost ready to be mixed.

This twentieth anniversary thing is almost like a little interlude before we get to next year. We're hoping to be touring a lot next year playing completely different stuff with a new album, marching forward.

<strong>Q.  When it comes to making new <a title="Click HERE to visit the official Garbage website..." href="https://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank">Garbage</a> music in 2015, in a music industry landscape that has moved further and further from the idea of the traditional, full album release in the twenty years since your debut, what is Garbage's current approach to new music:  Do you still think in terms of the album, and making an artistic statement in that manner, or has that become less important to you guys?</strong>

Marker:  I think the album is, in an old fashioned sense, back. More like the way things were when I was a kid probably. Which I love. I listened to both sides of vinyl when I was growing up more than single songs on the radio.

Back in the day, even when we were making the early albums, there were still people that would put money into what we were doing and were really hoping that we would come up with the next number one single. And it's kind of hard to get that out of your mind, even if you say you don't care about that. They still would be really, really happy to see that number one single. And, now, we're not gonna have a number one single. Because we're not Rihanna - don't want to be. So, cool. That's great.

In a way, that lifts a lot off your shoulders and kind of frees you up to do stuff. Like on this [new] album, there's one or two songs that are really long - they're not single length. They're more like seven or eight minutes. And it doesn't matter. If that's what we feel like works on the album, that's what we'll do.

<strong>Q.  I’ve heard you say that one of the most important things to you as a producer is to create something that sounds different. In today’s music culture, there’s not a lot breaking through right now that sounds different. How important is that idea of being different to you guys when it comes to getting together and working on new Garbage music?</strong>

Marker:  I think it's more of a concern than ever. To me, the way recording has gone - and we do it too - but everybody can kind of do anything on their laptop now. There's a lot of really standard building blocks that people use to make songs. I listen to electronic music... but there's a lot of people using all the same instruments and the same beats and the same drum machines and I think there's a lot of boring things going on because of that.

Or if [Brian] Eno is doing something on a production. Things like that. You'd even hear stuff on "Top 40" radio that would sound pretty weird. That's the kind of thing that I love.

I'd hate to think that things get kind of samey. We're maybe not blazing the trails of new sonic frontiers... but we're trying to. We're trying to make things sound interesting to us. And different. To me, that's one of the most important things when I hear something on the radio or on a record.

<strong>Q.  Over the course of the last twenty years, Garbage has played an awful lot in Chicago – whether it’s your own tours, radio station gigs, opening for acts like U2, etc.  I saw an interview where you told a story about seeing a Public Enemy/Sonic Youth show here and it made me curious if there are any particularly fond memories of Chicago that stick out for you in terms of performing with Garbage in Chicago…</strong>

But, man... <a title="More on the 1990 riot outside the Aragon at the Chicago Reader..." href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/fighting-the-power/Content?oid=876972" target="_blank">that riot</a> at the Public Enemy/<a title="More on the 1990 riot at the official Sonic Youth website..." href="http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/cc/122990.html" target="_blank">Sonic Youth</a> show.

And there was like 100 cop cars with their lights on outside of the show. And we kind of had to run to get out of there. The Aragon I think?
But that <a title="Read the Chicago Tribune's 1990 review of the Sonic Youth/Public Enemy concert at the Aragon Ballroom..." href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-01-01/features/9101010058_1_public-enemy-sonic-youth-flavor-flav" target="_blank">combination of music</a> was obviously something that struck me real hard - the beats and that sort of in your face sound combined with the dreamy guitars. It's kind of obvious but it was such a powerful idea at the time.

So that probably sticks out for me the most of a Chicago show.

<!--more-->

The conversation between John Medeski and Robert Randolph has a natural flow.  Nothing seems forced, everything seems fun and, above all else, the absolute love of music, and everything it's capable of, is clear.  That spirit sums up the pair's latest collaboration, <em>Soul Food</em>, with North Mississippi Allstars Luther Dickinson, Cody Dickinson and Chris Chew as The Word.

Born out of a mutual love of gospel music - specifically the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Steel_(musical_tradition)" target="_blank">sacred steel</a>" tradition and its value of the steel guitar - between Medeski and the Allstars, the group's self-titled debut plucked Randolph from relative obscurity circa 2001, exposed him to a recording studio for the first time and, ultimately, made possible the secular success he'd come to enjoy fronting his family band in the years to follow.

As is often the case when it comes to a "supergroup," hectic touring schedules for each member of The Word - Randolph with his own band, Medeski in Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Luther Dickinson as a member of the Black Crowes and North Mississippi Allstars tours alongside outings backing John Hiatt - made it difficult to get together and record.

But it never stopped the group from performing together periodically.  And as both Randolph and Medeski are quick to point out, The Word's best moments on record are born out of live performance.  So even with fourteen years between their only two studio albums, the group's potent mix of rock, soul, gospel, blues, jazz and more remains a potent one.

I spoke over the phone with John Medeski and Robert Randolph about the unique relationship that continues to make The Word special to them, the idea of incorporating spirituality in their music and why it's important to give the world positive, uplifting music in the year 2015.  What follows below is a lightly edited transcript of that phone conversation...

<strong>Q.  Well, your second album was released in May and it marks the group's first since 2001. With all of the touring and recording that each of you do with your own respective projects, I would imagine it has to be extremely difficult to get everyone together to write and record. What made this the right time for The Word to work on a new album?</strong>

<em>Robert Randolph</em>:  It all just really worked out.  We had talked about it over the past ten years or so.  We had some days off and we talked about it. We got together just to kind of see what energy we had or to see if things would sort of fall back into place.  So we got into Brooklyn for two or three days in a studio and there was just a lot of magic happening, a lot of music - a lot of great creative energy.

So we started to build on that and here we are today.

<strong>Q.  Let’s talk about the new album.  I've heard the debut album in 2001 came together in a matter of days and it sounds like this one might have followed a similar path.  You recorded <em>Soul Food</em> in both Brooklyn and Memphis - how long did you wind up working on the album and what kind of an effect did each studio have on the finished album?</strong>

<em>John Medeski</em>: We did a couple of days in Brooklyn and then a couple of days in Memphis.

<em>Randolph</em>:  I think it's just a sound and a vibe.  For us, I think it really doesn't matter which studio we're in.  We could be in a garage playing loud.

When you mix all these different sounds and influences together, it becomes the base of doing some gospel/instrumental, sort of sacred steel influenced stuff.  Once you sort of base it all off of that, then we just kind of... go.

It's a mixture of gospel and rock with some really bluesy influences.  Then we'll all just start playing.  John will start playing something on the organ or the piano.  Cody [Dickinson] will have so many ideas.  And Luther [Dickinson] will have ideas.  I'm gonna have some ideas.  It'll just keep going and going and going.  We kind of actually have to stop ourselves all the time.  Because the energy and the creative magic is something that just keeps happening!

<em>Medeski</em>:  Yeah, in Memphis we had to shut it down... because we were getting too much material! <em>(laughs)</em> We were like, "Alright, we gotta stop and just deal with what we've got and work on it."  It's really true.

Robert and I live up in the New York area and the [North Mississippi] Allstars all live down in North Mississippi or Memphis.  So it was just a natural choice to do a little recording in both places.

<strong>Q.  The debut album featured more traditional gospel songs than the new one does. Was that a logical direction to head this time around, to explore more of the collective, original sounds that you guys are capable of creating together?</strong>

<em>Randolph</em>:  I think what happens when we get together is the less thinking we could do, the more we could get done.  It's kind of one of those things.  If we all just play and then talk briefly about what we're gonna do, we'll get more done.  More talking just kind of confuses things.

It's funny because a lot of times us musicians can kind of get in our own way.  We've all been blessed with the ability to make magical music.  And the more we kind of hush up and play and compose, the more we'll get done.  I think that's really what makes this band sort of just... work.  And come together.

<em>Medeski</em>: Yes.

<em>Randolph</em>:  Most times, we're actually kind of clueless where we're gonna start and where we're gonna end.  We just sit down and we play and go, "Ok.  I guess we're done!" <em>(laughs)</em>

<em>Medeski</em>:  If you really listen, the music has a life of its own.  And it's clear what needs to happen next.  And if it's not really clear, we look at each other and somebody can give a look or a nod and send it in a certain direction.

We didn't really conceptually decide to do anything other than get together and make another record and see what happens when we get together. Because this band has a chemistry and that's what we realized.

<strong>Q.  In 2001, when you guys were recording the first Word album, Robert, those were some of your first experiences in a studio, right? After all the touring and recording you’ve done since, fourteen years later, how was it different getting back together with these guys this time around?</strong>

<em>Randolph</em>:  I would say the only difference would be that we've all kind of gotten better and we've grown.  Especially myself.  That was my first time, really, being in a studio sort of collaborating or being a part of something that was going to be big - or important I should say.

Now, like I say, I've gotten older and have recorded so much and played so much and created so much.

To be honest with you, it really doesn't matter if we're in a studio or a soundcheck or a back room - things just happen.  And that's the great thing about this band.  Most bands have to sit down and get the notepads out and go through this and go through that... We kind of just plug and play and arrange on the fly.  And it becomes this music that sounds like nothing else out there.  Which is really special.

It's one of those things... I think twenty years from now, people will be like, "Wow, man, listen to this!"  I mean, they're saying it now... But I think it's one of those things that just will continue to live on when you listen to this stuff.  Because in the midst of everybody trying to fit into a category, this music just goes.  It resonates.

<strong>Q.  You're starting to hit on something that's one of my favorite elements of what you guys do and that's the fact that both albums are positive and uplifiting.  Obviously the music industry, like the world in general at times, isn’t always, necessarily, the most positive of places.  How important is it to you guys to be giving something positive like this to the world in 2015?</strong>

<em>Medeski</em>:  For me, the most important thing is the music effects people in a way that gives them something - whatever it is - that takes them somewhere or makes them think.  Music gives you so many different things.  It can make you think.  It can make you feel so many different things.  And I think that's the most important thing.

And I think that with this band, it is that - it is uplifting.  The music is uplifting.

Music fills so many different roles - and it's all important - but with this band, the music is definitely uplifting.  I think it's what is great about it: it can be positive and fill you with a good feeling.  And it's not corny.  Its still got a lot of integrity.  To me, that's what's beautiful about it.

<em>Randolph</em>:  I've grown to accept that I kind of feel obligated to always make music that can be a positive influence with the growth of where the world is going, what the world is going to evolve into.  I hate to kind of go that route.  But it's me coming from church.  And my whole family's been in church.  And we've been preaching and singing and playing the gospel and living the good word and doing all these different things.  It's just important to accept that this is who I am.  This is why people have grown to accept me, my music, the word.

And to be able to collaborate with these guys who all sort of are great, loving... Look, the [North Mississippi] Allstars have grown up playing in church.  Their mother was the church organist.  And John is a very spiritual guy.

For me, it's really important to continue to make music.  Of course there's times where I want to be sexy like Lenny Kravitz but sometimes it just don't work out! <em>(both laughing)</em>

<strong>Q.  Robert just mentioned the word "spiritual" and, John, that's something I wanted to ask you about.  When it comes to m</strong><strong>aking a gospel album, the idea of spirituality would certainly seem to be an important one. Robert touched on the church history of several members of The Word but, for you, coming at this music from a more secular angle, what is it like trying to bring that idea of spirituality to this music?</strong>

<em>Medeski</em>:  It's what it's always been for me.  I think spirituality goes beyond on any single sect, cult or religion.  Spirituality is the whole thing.  At the end, every single one of them, love is like the main component.  Living from your heart.  That's kind of really the basis of, or really the core teaching of, any religion.  And I think that music is one of the best ways - Any kind of music can help peel off layers that get you to that place where that's what you're doing.  For me, music is healing like that.

As much as the word "spirituality" comes into play, for me, it's more about the spirit.  I want the spirit to be there.  The music's got to bring in the spirit.  And that's one of the things I've always loved about gospel music and why it's been such a big part of my life for a really long time.  Part of it is playing the organ - you have to.

To me, there's music from all over the world that I love and that sums it up:  People are playing for God or for healing.  And I love all that music.

I think it's one of the great things about this band.  It kind of ties in with what Robert was saying earlier:  We don't talk about the music.  Because the music has a life of it's own.  It's got a voice.  So that's the language.  That's the language that brings the spirit in.

<em>Randolph</em>:  It teaches you a discipline.  To always be sort of locked into really trying to have the music connect with the people.  Because as much as we love playing for ourselves, people pay money and come to live events.  So it's important to really be responsible for bringing everybody together as one.  And that's what the music is.

Whether you're meditating or singing or doing something, you're really just trying to get into this place where it's calming for the brain.  All these things bring about this spirituality.  It's a connection.  And it's important that when people come to the shows, that's what they're looking for: They're looking for that sense of release.

How many times we've all heard - I've heard it a bunch of times - that people come to a concert and they were mad or they were angry or this and that and they leave and go, "Wow!  I feel great!"

<em>Medeski</em>:  Yeah, that's what it's all about.  That's what it's all about.

<!--more-->

The conversation between John Medeski and Robert Randolph has a natural flow.  Nothing seems forced, everything seems fun and, above all else, the absolute love of music, and everything it's capable of, is clear.  That spirit sums up the pair's latest collaboration, <em>Soul Food</em>, with North Mississippi Allstars Luther Dickinson, Cody Dickinson and Chris Chew as The Word.

Born out of a mutual love of gospel music - specifically the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Steel_(musical_tradition)" target="_blank">sacred steel</a>" tradition and its value of the steel guitar - between Medeski and the Allstars, the group's self-titled debut plucked Randolph from relative obscurity circa 2001, exposed him to a recording studio for the first time and, ultimately, made possible the secular success he'd come to enjoy fronting his family band in the years to follow.

As is often the case when it comes to a "supergroup," hectic touring schedules for each member of The Word - Randolph with his own band, Medeski in Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Luther Dickinson as a member of the Black Crowes and North Mississippi Allstars tours alongside outings backing John Hiatt - made it difficult to get together and record.

But it never stopped the group from performing together periodically.  And as both Randolph and Medeski are quick to point out, The Word's best moments on record are born out of live performance.  So even with fourteen years between their only two studio albums, the group's potent mix of rock, soul, gospel, blues, jazz and more remains a potent one.

I spoke over the phone with John Medeski and Robert Randolph about the unique relationship that continues to make The Word special to them, the idea of incorporating spirituality in their music and why it's important to give the world positive, uplifting music in the year 2015.  What follows below is a lightly edited transcript of that phone conversation...

<strong>Q.  Well, your second album was released in May and it marks the group's first since 2001. With all of the touring and recording that each of you do with your own respective projects, I would imagine it has to be extremely difficult to get everyone together to write and record. What made this the right time for The Word to work on a new album?</strong>

<em>Robert Randolph</em>:  It all just really worked out.  We had talked about it over the past ten years or so.  We had some days off and we talked about it. We got together just to kind of see what energy we had or to see if things would sort of fall back into place.  So we got into Brooklyn for two or three days in a studio and there was just a lot of magic happening, a lot of music - a lot of great creative energy.

So we started to build on that and here we are today.

<strong>Q.  Let’s talk about the new album.  I've heard the debut album in 2001 came together in a matter of days and it sounds like this one might have followed a similar path.  You recorded <em>Soul Food</em> in both Brooklyn and Memphis - how long did you wind up working on the album and what kind of an effect did each studio have on the finished album?</strong>

<em>John Medeski</em>: We did a couple of days in Brooklyn and then a couple of days in Memphis.

<em>Randolph</em>:  I think it's just a sound and a vibe.  For us, I think it really doesn't matter which studio we're in.  We could be in a garage playing loud.

When you mix all these different sounds and influences together, it becomes the base of doing some gospel/instrumental, sort of sacred steel influenced stuff.  Once you sort of base it all off of that, then we just kind of... go.

It's a mixture of gospel and rock with some really bluesy influences.  Then we'll all just start playing.  John will start playing something on the organ or the piano.  Cody [Dickinson] will have so many ideas.  And Luther [Dickinson] will have ideas.  I'm gonna have some ideas.  It'll just keep going and going and going.  We kind of actually have to stop ourselves all the time.  Because the energy and the creative magic is something that just keeps happening!

<em>Medeski</em>:  Yeah, in Memphis we had to shut it down... because we were getting too much material! <em>(laughs)</em> We were like, "Alright, we gotta stop and just deal with what we've got and work on it."  It's really true.

Robert and I live up in the New York area and the [North Mississippi] Allstars all live down in North Mississippi or Memphis.  So it was just a natural choice to do a little recording in both places.

<strong>Q.  The debut album featured more traditional gospel songs than the new one does. Was that a logical direction to head this time around, to explore more of the collective, original sounds that you guys are capable of creating together?</strong>

It's funny because a lot of times us musicians can kind of get in our own way.  We've all been blessed with the ability to make magical music.  And the more we kind of hush up and play and compose, the more we'll get done.  I think that's really what makes this band sort of just... work.  And come together.

When it came time to start thinking about his third solo album - the sessions with longtime producer Gus Oberg that encompassed what eventually became <em>Momentary Masters - </em>Strokes rhythm guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. was very much influenced by astronomer Carl Sagan's book <em>Pale Blue Dot</em>.

The journey out of rehab, which eventually led him back to the studio, featured stops along the way to ponder subjects like the loss of innocence and, more to the point, whether it was possible to experience music in the way most children do upon falling in love with it for the first time at a young age - to have fun with it.

In talking with Hammond, it's clear just how much he values his current band and just how much his comfort level with them has grown.  Together, they all crafted <i>Momentary Masters</i> in the studio and as they continue to work together on the road, bond deepening, it's anyone's guess where the music they'll continue to make will go.  But it's clear Hammond wants to keep making it.  With this band.  Because it's fun again.

Headed to Bottom Lounge for a set Tuesday night with his band, I spoke with Albert Hammond, Jr. over the phone last month about crafting his third solo album <i>Momentary Masters</i> (and what sets it apart from his work with The Strokes), the idea of new beginnings, having fun and much more.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows below...

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Q.  This will be your first time back in Chicago performing in support of your new solo album Momentary Masters since Lollapalooza.  Whether it’s the festival circuit or the smaller clubs, how have these dates with your new band gone so far?</span>

<i><a href="http://alberthammondjr.com/" target="_blank">Albert Hammond, Jr</a>.</i>:  I’m excited for that.  Actually, I was rehearsing for Lollapalooza and we rehearsed at Music Garage so I walked by [Bottom Lounge].

We’ve only really done Primavera right before the album came out and then Lollapalooza and The Tonight Show and a few radio things.

So I’m looking forward to actually playing our own show and doing our own kind of setlists.

<b>Q.  This album, while clearly a rock album, also kind of seems to have more of a rhythm to it than some of your previous solo work – you can really kind of move to it, dance to it.  Was writing with that idea of rhythm in mind a concerted effort or is that just kind of how this batch of songs came out?</b>

AHJ: I guess a little bit of both.  I felt like I was missing songs in the set and there were certain vibes from bands I had been listening to – Wire, Wipers, Misfits – that I wanted when I played live.  So I did my own interpretation of that.

I feel like we could play this whole album and it definitely has a great energy to it on the record and especially live.

<b>Q.  There’s a very unique style to your solo recordings, especially on the new album. There seems to be a lot more guitar too.  When it comes to crafting these solo songs now, how is that process different than when you’re working with the Strokes?</b>

AHJ: I thought I actually played maybe less guitar on this because all the parts I wrote beforehand, or stuff that I was figuring out, the other guys would enhance and then they would play it.  That was kind of the whole thing – this was like the first time that I got to use the band and arrange the songs in the studio.  So we really took it to a whole new place.

I’m not the main songwriter in The Strokes so that’s probably the biggest difference.  The second biggest difference is just working with different people gives you different outcomes.

I feel like that’s kind of what stylizes anyone who plays music on their own:  They either try to keep - if they can afford to because the band is successful they try to keep the people they’re playing with because they’re good (as in Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers) - or they go through different people in their career and it helps create different sounds.  Or they’re just in a different place and these people help bring stuff to that (IE – David Bowie and all his different, main people he’s used over different albums).

<b>Q.  To that point, you worked again on this album with longtime collaborator Gus Oberg, who produced it.  What’s that partnership between the two of you like and what kind of an effect did it have on Momentary Masters</b><b>?</b>

AHJ:  I feel like it still works because, besides enjoying each other’s company, I feel like we can do bigger and better things so we constantly push each other.  So I feel like what still works about is that it’s not an easygoing thing.

I’m used to him – But you could ask the band who maybe isn’t used to people being like that – but it’s kind of like, as something was progressing and he was dialing in tones, I’d always run up and be like, “How does it feel to an outsider?”  And he was just very blunt.  He’d be like, “No, it’s sh--y.”  “It sounds like a bar band.” Or whatever.

And I feel like that’s what keeps our relationship – the two of our’s when we’re working on music – that’s what keep it going.  And then me being able to, if I believe in something, kind of go back to him like, “I disagree.”  And then we could have a discussion and try to make it better.

That’s why we work well together and why we keep working – because we keep pushing each other.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Q.  In the past, I know you’ve bounced ideas for some of your solo work off of some of the members of The Strokes.  Was that the case this time around?</span>

AHJ:  I did that on the [<em>AHJ</em>] EP because I was on Cult [Records] and that’s kind of like a Julian thing when you’re on Cult.

But, no.  I felt like I already had plenty of input on it.  I did send it to [Julian Casablancas] when it was done but I didn’t ask for any input.

<b>Q.  There’s obviously a number of interesting ideas and themes that had a profound effect on the new record and one of the most obvious ones is your path to sobriety.  How did that process kind of shape <i>Momentary Masters</i></b><b>? </b>

AHJ:  I guess the biggest way it shaped it over such a period of time was that... I think when you fall in love with music when you’re a kid, there’s something there that you can lose and it definitely has nothing to do with drugs.  If anything, stopping [drugs] and discovering new things kind of brought me back to that feeling and I guess connected me with different kinds of people.

I spent more time listening and learning and just doing fun work figuring stuff out.

<b>Q.  One idea I’ve heard you come back to when talking about the new record - and I think you may have just been alluding to this - is the process of losing innocence while rediscovering curiosity – and even more specifically, the idea that change can be a good thing.  How would you say your curiosity manifested itself musically on <i>Momentary Masters</i>?</b>

AHJ:  Well, I think the thing was to realize that change is just constant.  So you can look at it however you want – but if you don’t look at it as a good thing, it’s going to become a constant bother to you.

At first, I had to almost program it in to have fun.  I was very lost the first couple of years getting out [of rehab].  I didn’t know – forget music – just feeling like you’re involved in the circle that is life.  You’ve never felt so far removed.  It’s almost like you’re looking at a river and it’s flowing down and you’re standing on the outside and everyone’s in there going on living life and you’re like, “Well, how do I get in there?”

I don’t know.  It comes over time.  You start to get out of yourself a little bit and feel more comfortable.  Usually, when you end up doing drugs like that, you don’t really grow so much anymore.  It just stops.  So I feel like you basically just get back on that train that you would’ve normally.  Maybe sometimes it happens to people naturally anyways?

I find that there’s a lot of parallels in life whether you do one thing or not.  There’s a lot of parallels.  A lot of people, as they get older, they fall into the same patterns as if they had done drugs – and you forget to try to find new things to be excited about.

Someone wrote in a review I read – that’s why I can’t read them but I thought it was funny – I think they were hating on me a little bit – It was like, “So what?  He read a few books and found a few new ideas.”  And I feel like you can simplify it like that but that’s part of what I feel gets exciting about life as you get older:  you have the time to let those things come in and have conversations about them and just see what they bring you – what change they bring – and see what you can do to leave this place a little better than when you came in.

<b>Q.  I get the feeling that you look at this album almost as sort of a new beginning .  Would you say this record closes a chapter for you or starts a new one?</b>

AHJ:  Whatever old chapters [there are] have been closed a while ago.  Why this feels like, to me, a new beginning or why it might feel like that to other people, is just I feel like I made a record that marks a point and marks some kind of excitement.

That usually brings people to think, “Oh, something new is happening.  I haven’t heard of you in a while.  You’ve been doing Strokes stuff and then you came out with the EP.”

[The EP] was kind of quiet so it didn’t get as much press.  All the sudden here’s this thing and it feels fun and fresh – and [I’m] older but it feels younger in some way.  So I feel like that’s the beginning of something new – or I would like it to be.  I’m trying to see if it can stand on its own two feet and keep the guys I was working with and do new music.  Because I feel like it came together really well.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Q.  Which is interesting because you worked on this album together and now you're touring with this band too.  You've worked together a lot at this point.  I believe I read you’re already working on more new material - so as you continue to work with these guys, what kind of effect do you feel that’s having on where the music goes from here?</span>

AHJ:  We ended with a song called “Power Hungry” and I felt like it was very interesting how it was recorded and how it all came together.  So it ended on a very positive, interesting note – probably our favorite. Everyone, at the time when they were hearing the instrumentals, it was probably our favorite.  So it ended on a note that builds a confidence together.

So I feel like if we went in to do it now, we would start from a different point than we did before.  There’s a bunch of stuff you kind of try.  And you have little things and you don’t know if they work.  Sometimes they do work but sometimes other ones go faster, so you go after those.  Sometimes that’s just how a record goes.  The whole goal is every day, by the end of the day, you want to be somewhere better than you were.  It’s not always the case, but you keep it in mind.

But I’m constantly working on them.  Now is probably the biggest down time – because in between putting it out you do all this press and you’re rehearsing.  So you’ve got very little time to think of new music because you have to put yourself in a different head space.

But I’ve started to organize stuff that we were doing, and other songs, and I feel, knowing how everyone interprets what I do, I feel like I have these songs and I’m really excited to share [them with the band].

I feel like I don’t have to demo the parts so seriously anymore.  I feel like I trust us working together.  At first that wasn’t the case – I had demoed three songs and done all this stuff.  Then when I saw how they changed parts and made them better and I changed parts and made them better, it became, “Ok, I’ll bring this stuff in a rawer form.”

And that’s kind of what I’d do now and that’s kind of what I’m excited for.

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Q.  You’ve hit on the word "fun" several times.  You’re at a point now where you’re doing both festival gigs like Lollapalooza and smaller club gigs in support of the new solo record as well as a handful of Strokes dates.  It would seem like you’ve got a good thing going right now.  So… is it fun again?</span>

AHJ:  Yes.  For sure.  I mean, nothing is ever 100%.  And with whatever fun you get, you can get the opposite effect in there with you.

But it’s definitely that again.

I wouldn’t have committed to doing all this touring or all this press if it wasn’t.  It’s impossible.

So, yeah, it’s a lot of fun again.

When it came time to start thinking about his third solo album - the sessions with longtime producer Gus Oberg that encompassed what eventually became <em>Momentary Masters - </em>Strokes rhythm guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. was very much influenced by astronomer Carl Sagan's book <em>Pale Blue Dot</em>.

The journey out of rehab, which eventually led him back to the studio, featured stops along the way to ponder subjects like the loss of innocence and, more to the point, whether it was possible to experience music in the way most children do upon falling in love with it for the first time at a young age - to have fun with it.

In talking with Hammond, it's clear just how much he values his current band and just how much his comfort level with them has grown.  Together, they all crafted <i>Momentary Masters</i> in the studio and as they continue to work together on the road, bond deepening, it's anyone's guess where the music they'll continue to make will go.  But it's clear Hammond wants to keep making it.  With this band.  Because it's fun again.

Headed to Bottom Lounge for a set Tuesday night with his band, I spoke with Albert Hammond, Jr. over the phone last month about crafting his third solo album <i>Momentary Masters</i> (and what sets it apart from his work with The Strokes), the idea of new beginnings, having fun and much more.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows below...

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Q.  This will be your first time back in Chicago performing in support of your new solo album Momentary Masters since Lollapalooza.  Whether it’s the festival circuit or the smaller clubs, how have these dates with your new band gone so far?</span>

<i><a href="http://alberthammondjr.com/" target="_blank">Albert Hammond, Jr</a>.</i>:  I’m excited for that.  Actually, I was rehearsing for Lollapalooza and we rehearsed at Music Garage so I walked by [Bottom Lounge].

We’ve only really done Primavera right before the album came out and then Lollapalooza and The Tonight Show and a few radio things.

So I’m looking forward to actually playing our own show and doing our own kind of setlists.

<b>Q.  This album, while clearly a rock album, also kind of seems to have more of a rhythm to it than some of your previous solo work – you can really kind of move to it, dance to it.  Was writing with that idea of rhythm in mind a concerted effort or is that just kind of how this batch of songs came out?</b>

The biggest story, maybe of the entire weekend, was just how shockingly dry it was in Douglas Park to start the third and final day of Riot Fest 2015 on Chicago’s west side.

Standing water receded and while there were still isolated, easily avoidable areas of mud, Sunday might have featured the best festival-going conditions of any of Riot Fest’s four years now as an outdoor festival in a Chicago city park.

The cleanup process is no doubt already in progress but Sunday was the type of day that has the possibility to save organizers not just significant money, as repair costs begin to tabulate, but also headaches.

And, especially given Riot Fest’s more recently embattled status, it’s worth noting, once again, that Riot Fest featured the most easy-going, well behaved concertgoers of any festival to take place in Chicago this year.

Chicago has become one of the most festival populated cities in North America featuring major, outdoor, three day festivals like Lollapalooza, Pitchfork, North Coast, Riot Fest and more.

One of those festivals has become almost laughable in its lack of response to continually escalating and embarrassing audience antics (and it’s not Riot Fest).  It’s a shame so many people at the local level ignore that fact and assume the worst of Riot Fest simply because they’re scared of the word “Riot.”  The growing, negative public perception of Riot Fest in that regard is misguided and utterly mind-boggling.

If Saturday’s slate of live music performances was geared toward legends like Merle Haggard, Iggy Pop and more, Sunday’s story was decidedly that of the success of rap and hip-hop with performances by De La Soul, Cypress Hill, Yelawolf, Snoop Dogg and more.

And it's a story which has no doubt rankled longtime fans of a festival that cut it’s teeth booking – and reuniting – primarily punk rock acts since it’s humble beginnings at small clubs throughout the city like Double Door and Congress Theater since 2005. But Riot Fest's eclectic array of musical bookings has become one of its most successful elements, especially over the past four years.

One of the best, positive, most energetic sets of the entire weekend came over the course of forty-five minutes early Sunday afternoon courtesy of De La Soul.  “This isn’t gonna be your typical hip-hop show” said the group early on.

Hip-hop is often at its best when backed by a live band.  But De La Soul proved that theory very wrong in a set dominated by some of the most impressive audience participation of the entire weekend.

“It’s sunny, be happy!” said the group moments before “Me Myself and I” rang out across Douglas Park.  It was a triumphant set in every possible way.

Hum also performed early Sunday, a rare opportunity to catch the pride of Champaign, Illinois in the live setting as they’ve played sporadically at best since about 2000 with only a handful of Chicago dates in the past fifteen years.

Still featuring all four members from their most successful era, the alternative rock group hit upon a forty-five minute set that veered at times from mere alternative to something more resembling pyschedelia infused metal.

“I’d Like Your Hair Long” from their underrated 1995 debut <i>You’d Prefer an Astronaut</i> came early and, in between checks of the Packers/Bears score, their biggest hit, “Stars,” came late.

But it was “I Hate it Too” that both closed and stole the set. It began with a sparse arrangement featuring only the vocals of Matt Talbott and the guitar of Tim Lash before the rest of the band kicked in midway through.  Hum was at it’s most animated during the passionate performance and it stood out as one of Sunday’s best.

Cypress Hill delivered a surprisingly strong set Sunday as well.  And it was impressive just how good B-Real still sounds, delivering his trademark high pitched vocals throughout a forty-five minute set.

As always the group spit lovingly about marijuana during cuts like “Hits From the Bong” and got the crowd moving with a slew of hits including “How I Could Just Kill a Man” early and “Insane in the Brain” late.

Riot Fest 2015 also featured reunion sets by two of the better all female, nineties alternative acts with Babes In Toyland delivering on Saturday and L7 kicking things up a notch Sunday.

As was the case throughout the first two days, sound was an issue again Sunday.  At times the between song banter of Hum’s Matt Talbott was almost indecipherable and fans clearly wanted it louder at the beginning of L7’s set.

Featuring a reunion of their most enduring and successful lineup (guitarist/vocalist Donita Sparks, guitarist/vocalist Suzi Gardner, bassist/vocalist Jennifer Finch and drummer Demetra Plakas), the group hit upon elements from most of their career, going back to 1990 for the opening “Deathwish,” immediately following with one of their biggest hits in “Andres” from their 1994 high watermark <i>Hungry for Stink</i>.  “Suck it, Trump!” they yelled upon launching into “One More Thing,” one of the few politicized moments all weekend.

But just as Saturday belonged to a legend in Merle Haggard, Sunday did as well in the form of 67 year old reggae icon Jimmy Cliff.  Displaying the  energy of a performer half his age, Cliff was without a doubt one of the weekend’s most animated stars.

“You Can Get it if you Really Want” came early in a set dominated by an incredibly tight eight piece backing band that featured a horn section, multiple keyboard and guitar players and more.

The best covers of the weekend also belonged to Cliff who hit on a gorgeous version of Cat Stevens’ “Wild World” before strapping on a guitar himself for his 1993 cover of Johnny Nash’s “I Can See Clearly Now.”  Given the weather, the latter was incredibly appropriate as the sun began to set on Douglas Park.

“This song is from the movie that brought reggae to the whole world!” declared the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer triumphantly as the band launched into the outstanding “The Harder They Come” from the 1972 film of the same name.  Cliff’s dancing during the song belied a youthful exuberance and, paired with the song’s uplifting lyrics, it was one of the more positive moments to take place all weekend.

Assuming Snoop Dogg would hit the stage late, as he generally does (spoiler alert: he did), it was off to see Replacements/Guns N’ Roses bassist Tommy Stinson and his new band featuring fellow GNR member Frank Ferrer on drums alongside Steve Selvidge of The Hold Steady on guitar, bassist Cat Popper (Ryan Adams’ Cardinals) and keyboardist Tony Kieraldo

Despite a sparse crowd, the group ran through a terrific forty-five minute set that hit upon cuts like “Breathing Room” from an upcoming, new Stinson solo release.

Clad in a t-shirt featuring a spray-painted “R” on it (perhaps a nod to fellow Replacement Paul Westerberg’s <a href="http://www.paulwesterberg.com/tag/shirt-watch/" target="_blank">series of shirts</a> to close out the recent run of Replacements reunion dates) Stinson ended a strong set with “Never Aim to Please” and “Friday Night (Is Killing Me)” from his excellent 1993 post-Replacements project Bash &amp; Pop.

Assuming Snoop would be late was a sound strategy though it may have led to a disappointing set for fans waiting to hear him perform his 1993 album <i>Doggystyle</i> in its entirety.  While a strong set, it was by no means a full performance of that album, veering instead to a more hits oriented one with performances of covers like Dr. Dre’s “Nuthin' but a ‘G’ Thang,” and House of Pain’s “Jump Around” as well as hits like “Drop it Like it’s Hot,” and “Young, Wild and Free.”

Sometimes Snoop performs backed by a band and other times it’s merely him and an MC.  Of all the material in the Snoop Dogg catalog, <i>Doggystyle</i>, in particular, given it’s heavy George Clinton influence, deserved the full band treatment… But Snoop didn’t bother performing most of the album anyway.  At one point, he seemed to blame festival organizers for his delay though, again, it’s worth noting that he’s seldom on time.

That said, he did hit on choice cuts from the seminal G-Funk album like “Gin and Juice,” a remixed “Lodi Dodi,” “Who Am I? (What’s My Name?)” and “Tha Shiznit” and the crowd ate it up.

There are times when it seems Riot Fest can’t catch a break.  For the second consecutive day, rain fell early on Saturday, before festival gates opened, with nary a drop actually falling during the festival itself.

Sunshine, once again, dominated the majority of the afternoon… but the damage was done.  Two days worth of rain have left the park a muddy mess.  Even worse, standing water left for an often rancid affair especially in one of the festival’s busiest corridors, through the midway connecting both sets of main stages.  Another costly, lengthy cleanup and repair process seems likely.

But Riot Fest attendees are used to the mud, seasoned by several years of it across multiple city parks on both the west and near northwest sides.

What concertgoers aren’t necessarily used to is exactly what awaits in the streets of North Lawndale only blocks from Douglas Park on the city’s west side.  The open air drug market my cab driver and I marveled en route to Riot Fest Saturday was a depressing reminder of exactly that.

But there’s no denying the strength of Riot Fest’s lineup – arguably tops in the U.S. in 2015 – or their desire to transcend the typical concert experience, offering fans an education in the second year of the outstanding “Riot Fest Speaks” series of panel discussions.

Last year, Riot Fest scored an American festival coup in their booking of Pussy Riot members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina.  Saturday afternoon “Riot Fest Speaks” featured a fascinating panel discussion moderated by Henry Rollins featuring Damian Echols and Jason Baldwin.

Echols and Baldwin, better known as two of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis_Three" target="_blank">West Memphis Three</a>” were tried and convicted of murder in 1993 and served over eighteen years in prison before being released in 2011 following Alford pleas upon the presentation of new evidence.

Despite little initial, actual evidence against them, the three were fingered for the brutal murder of three Arkansas boys due largely in part to the fact that they stood out as different with their long hair and love of loud music in a Bible Belt town where that simply wasn’t accepted.

“One of the easiest ways to mobilize people to a cause is through music” said Rollins of the role music can play in activism.  Rollins himself, as he went to great lengths to explain (almost too far), played an integral part in organizing artists and raising funds to aid in the three’s mounting mid-90’s legal bills.

Baldwin, who at the time was singled out during the trial for the fact that he owned twelve Metallica t-shirts, painted an exhausting picture of the ill effects the case had on his immediate family in the ensuing years.  But somehow he never lost hope.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">
</span>

“I didn’t necessarily see hope in the system… I don’t know how, I don’t know where [help is] gonna come from… But we can’t give up” said Baldwin of his mindset while incarcerated as a variety of artists, most notably Metallica, began to ask questions, ultimately raising both funds and awareness toward the case.

“That could’ve been me!” said Rollins summing up the mindset of a number of musicians and music fans in a mid-nineties world that was far less tolerant of anything, like punk rock, which didn’t fit the Bible Belt idea of the status quo.

“We felt like sheep being led to the slaughter” added Baldwin, a scary reminder of just how intolerable the world could be a mere twenty years ago.

Saturday’s music lineup featured another impressive array of artists, skewing more toward “legends” than at any point thus far in the weekend, given performances by the likes of Bootsy Collins, Merle Haggard and Iggy Pop.

Early Saturday sets featured artists like The Joy Formidable.  Finishing up work on their new album, the trio tore through their biggest hit "Whirring” to close a forty-five minute set.

Meanwhile, the Dead Milkmen, reunited since about 2008 and still featuring all living, original members, launched into a forty-five minute set of sophomoric punk rock that, at times, was nearly unbearable.

Notable Milkmen cuts like “Punk Rock Girl” were present and accounted for early but by their fourth reference to an “Emmanuel Lewis handjob!” it was time to move on.

Echo and the Bunnymen got rolling with one of the strongest opening numbers all weekend in “Lips Like Sugar.”

Despite the sub par sound that has plagued the Riot Stage all weekend (see “Molly, Flogging”), the group tore through forty-five strong minutes that included a dedication of “Villiers Terrace” (a version which meandered into The Doors’ “Roadhouse Blues”) to Metro owner Joe Shanahan (who himself moderates a “Riot Fest Speaks” panel at the festival Sunday afternoon).

“Anyone on drugs out there, you’re gonna love this” asserted frontman Ian McCulloch as the band launched into “Over the Wall” before closing strong with a slew of hits including “Bring on the Dancing Horses” and “Killing Moon” as well as a cover of Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side.”

One of Riot Fest’s strongest attributes this year is the diversity of the lineup.  No where was that more clear than heading directly from an Echo and the Bunnymen set to see Bootsy Collins.

In the grand Parliament Funkadelic tradition from which he came, Bootsy Collins’ Rubber Band featured eleven members onstage Saturday afternoon.

Drawing from his time as a member of James Brown’s band, Saturday’s set was rich with horns, most notably on Parliament’s “Mothership Connection,” one which acted as almost of a bit of a mashup with Parliament’s “P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up).”

Ultimately, it was the band’s long, meandering sonic exploration of Bootsy’s own 1976 hit “I’d Rather Be With You” that highlighted both an entertaining and musically satisfying set of funk from one of the genre’s best.

“This song is about marijuana!” declared country legend Merle Haggard to the delight of a massive throng assembled at dusk for a forty-five minute country and western clinic.

Closing with the classic “Okie From Muskogee,” Haggard, 78, proved just how strong an asset a tight backing band – quite possibly the best to grace a Riot Fest stage – can be.

Continuing an afternoon full of diverse bookings, Saturday went from country to rock at a moment’s notice as Billy Idol took the stage only moments later for a triumphant set despite another bevy of sound issues (the sound cut out what seemed to be entirely multiple times during the performance).

Drawing on the finer moments of his latest release (the aptly titled “Can’t Break Me Down” from 2014’s <i>Kings and Queens of the Underground</i>), Idol filled a set with some of the biggest hits the eighties decade has to offer in “Eyes Without a Face,” “Rebel Yell,” and “White Wedding.”

Guitarist Steve Stevens was sharp as always and focusing on the hits across only an hour led to one of the weekend’s most focused and fun sets.  Idol clearly has as much fun onstage as anyone in the crowd and that becomes contagious fast in the festival setting.  Long live the fist pump.

But Saturday night belonged to Iggy Pop.  Returning to Riot Fest following a headlining 2013 set as a member of The Stooges, Pop focused this time around on his solo work.

At 68 years of age, one keeps waiting for Iggy to lose a step – he still hasn’t.  Pogoing across the stage with reckless abandon, Pop tore through “The Passenger” early on (the one solo track he performed with the Stooges two years ago at Riot Fest) before heading straight into “Lust for Life,” perhaps the strongest one-two punch festivalgoers will see all weekend.

Stealing back “Real Wild Child (Wild One)” from the depths of eighties production hell, Pop clearly reveled in the adoration of the massive crowd.

“Aw, f---in thanks!  Hit it mother f---ers!” Pop demanded of his solid band, skipping nary a beat upon launching into “Sister Midnight” before leaving the stage to join the crowd, as always, for “Nightclubbing.”

But despite the emphasis on the solo tracks, it was The Stooges’ “1969” that stood out as one of the set’s finest moments, it’s more rocking treatment forty-six years after initial release a testament to Iggy’s enduring punk rock legacy.

There are times when it seems Riot Fest can’t catch a break.  For the second consecutive day, rain fell early on Saturday, before festival gates opened, with nary a drop actually falling during the festival itself.

Sunshine, once again, dominated the majority of the afternoon… but the damage was done.  Two days worth of rain have left the park a muddy mess.  Even worse, standing water left for an often rancid affair especially in one of the festival’s busiest corridors, through the midway connecting both sets of main stages.  Another costly, lengthy cleanup and repair process seems likely.

But Riot Fest attendees are used to the mud, seasoned by several years of it across multiple city parks on both the west and near northwest sides.

What concertgoers aren’t necessarily used to is exactly what awaits in the streets of North Lawndale only blocks from Douglas Park on the city’s west side.  The open air drug market my cab driver and I marveled en route to Riot Fest Saturday was a depressing reminder of exactly that.

But there’s no denying the strength of Riot Fest’s lineup – arguably tops in the U.S. in 2015 – or their desire to transcend the typical concert experience, offering fans an education in the second year of the outstanding “Riot Fest Speaks” series of panel discussions.

Last year, Riot Fest scored an American festival coup in their booking of Pussy Riot members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina.  Saturday afternoon “Riot Fest Speaks” featured a fascinating panel discussion moderated by Henry Rollins featuring Damian Echols and Jason Baldwin.

Echols and Baldwin, better known as two of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis_Three" target="_blank">West Memphis Three</a>” were tried and convicted of murder in 1993 and served over eighteen years in prison before being released in 2011 following Alford pleas upon the presentation of new evidence.

Despite little initial, actual evidence against them, the three were fingered for the brutal murder of three Arkansas boys due largely in part to the fact that they stood out as different with their long hair and love of loud music in a Bible Belt town where that simply wasn’t accepted.

“One of the easiest ways to mobilize people to a cause is through music” said Rollins of the role music can play in activism.  Rollins himself, as he went to great lengths to explain (almost too far), played an integral part in organizing artists and raising funds to aid in the three’s mounting mid-90’s legal bills.

Baldwin, who at the time was singled out during the trial for the fact that he owned twelve Metallica t-shirts, painted an exhausting picture of the ill effects the case had on his immediate family in the ensuing years.  But somehow he never lost hope.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">

“I didn’t necessarily see hope in the system… I don’t know how, I don’t know where [help is] gonna come from… But we can’t give up” said Baldwin of his mindset while incarcerated as a variety of artists, most notably Metallica, began to ask questions, ultimately raising both funds and awareness toward the case.

“That could’ve been me!” said Rollins summing up the mindset of a number of musicians and music fans in a mid-nineties world that was far less tolerant of anything, like punk rock, which didn’t fit the Bible Belt idea of the status quo.

“We felt like sheep being led to the slaughter” added Baldwin, a scary reminder of just how intolerable the world could be a mere twenty years ago.

Saturday’s music lineup featured another impressive array of artists, skewing more toward “legends” than at any point thus far in the weekend, given performances by the likes of Bootsy Collins, Merle Haggard and Iggy Pop.

Early Saturday sets featured artists like The Joy Formidable.  Finishing up work on their new album, the trio tore through their biggest hit "Whirring” to close a forty-five minute set.

Meanwhile, the Dead Milkmen, reunited since about 2008 and still featuring all living, original members, launched into a forty-five minute set of sophomoric punk rock that, at times, was nearly unbearable.

Notable Milkmen cuts like “Punk Rock Girl” were present and accounted for early but by their fourth reference to an “Emmanuel Lewis handjob!” it was time to move on.

Echo and the Bunnymen got rolling with one of the strongest opening numbers all weekend in “Lips Like Sugar.”

Despite the sub par sound that has plagued the Riot Stage all weekend (see “Molly, Flogging”), the group tore through forty-five strong minutes that included a dedication of “Villiers Terrace” (a version which meandered into The Doors’ “Roadhouse Blues”) to Metro owner Joe Shanahan (who himself moderates a “Riot Fest Speaks” panel at the festival Sunday afternoon).

“Anyone on drugs out there, you’re gonna love this” asserted frontman Ian McCulloch as the band launched into “Over the Wall” before closing strong with a slew of hits including “Bring on the Dancing Horses” and “Killing Moon” as well as a cover of Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side.”

One of Riot Fest’s strongest attributes this year is the diversity of the lineup.  No where was that more clear than heading directly from an Echo and the Bunnymen set to see Bootsy Collins.

In the grand Parliament Funkadelic tradition from which he came, Bootsy Collins’ Rubber Band featured eleven members onstage Saturday afternoon.

Drawing from his time as a member of James Brown’s band, Saturday’s set was rich with horns, most notably on Parliament’s “Mothership Connection,” one which acted as almost of a bit of a mashup with Parliament’s “P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up).”
