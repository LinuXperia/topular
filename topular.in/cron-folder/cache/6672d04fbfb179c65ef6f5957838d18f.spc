Interestingly, her last straw was a young man who - by a staggering coincidence - had a "spot" at the end of my street. I'd dropped off the odd bag of groceries for him only to find he was the inspiration for an entire system designed to help the critical, immediate needs of the homeless living on the street. The social service system in my hometown leaves much to be desired, even though there are many, many kind and energetic people like the Hunters, who took me along on one of their "runs," where they literally hunted down "street people" they'd come to know to deliver food, clothes and other necessities. (Quotes because "people" shouldn't need a qualifier.)

I was inspired to be more strategic about the food I kept in the car, so I could share it with anyone who asked...and I thought my granola was doing well until someone kindly pointed out that he couldn't chew (dental hygiene being significantly difficult when living "rough.") I realized that strategy for protein wasn't working.

It's a particular challenge to find things that work, because you can't assume access to anything: utensils, water, a heat source. I started giving single-serve tubs of peanut butter with bags of pretzels, or those little tuna or chicken salad meal kits, but those got to be clumsy to hand out the window in traffic. I finally sat down and created a more formal package - although I'm not done yet, I've put in a bulk order for string backpacks, and am going to get some plastic ponchos, mylar emergency blankets and socks as soon as I find a source.

Why "kits?" I've recently become more educated than I really prefer in just how difficult it is to be homeless. I befriended a young family who are "precariously housed." (Precarious housing is social-work-speak for couch-surfing.) She is an incredibly lovely woman, a significantly better mother to her kids than I am to mine, and smart, but due to circumstances well beyond her control, at the moment she has nowhere to go and no way to work.

I've known her since October, and during that time have spent a minimum of 20 hours a week getting her ACCESS to services. You know, the "free stuff" that "anybody" can get. It requires intake interview after intake interview after intake interview - all of which have to be done with two energetic toddlers in the room - none of which are located anywhere convenient, or even near each other - and all of which have some sort of "requirement" that has to be fulfilled and proved with a return visit before the REAL intake, e.g. a doctor's visit, proof that another service turned you down, or my personal favorite: a "letter of support" from someone - because, OBVIOUSLY, nobody homeless could possibly get to a social service agency WITHOUT HELP.  I cannot imagine what it must be like if you are ACTUALLY on the street. Grrr.

Am I mad? You bet I'm mad - we have gone off the rails when it comes to offering help to our fellow human beings, America. I'm beginning to believe that we are more vested in systems that APPEAR to help than we are in actually helping, and the people actually providing services are caught in the middle, doing the best they can to get everyone's needs met without enough time, money, or manpower.  All that is to say that nobody is homeless for fun - I am very privileged to have a very cozy and nice home, and only had to "couchsurf" once or twice during college. All I'm doing is providing research, transportation, occasional toddler-herding and sympathy. Let me tell you - other than getting to spend time with my friend and her sweet kids - it is absolutely, completely, FRUSTRATING IN THE EXTREME.

I can't believe the grace with which my friend manages her situation; I'd be flat-out bonkers (frankly, I had ONE toddler and WAS flat-out bonkers and had all my needs met!) Anybody with stories about "welfare mothers" clearly never stood in line at the DHS, which is frighteningly similar to the Records Department in <a href="http://www.scifimoviezone.com/imagedieselpunk/brazil001.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Brazil.</em></a>

Case in point, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/09/world/middleeast/document-the-letter-senate-republicans-addressed-to-the-leaders-of-iran.html">GOP's intervention in our negotiations in Iran</a>, written in a tone that implies the people of Iran are incapable of understanding the intricacies of government, much less the complexities of nuclear physics.

As the GOP attempts to "educate" Iran, they might think about brushing up a bit on basic math. People who probably joke about "<a href="https://www.njctl.org/courses/science/algebra-based-physics/nuclear-physics/nuclear-physics-presentation/">weapons of math destruction</a>" don't realize that the word algebra, in fact, comes from the title of Persian book written somewhere around 780 AD: <i>ilm <strong>al-jabr</strong> wa'l-muḳābala</i> ‘The Science of Restoring What Is Missing and Equating Like With Like.’ (isn't that a poetic description of algebra?) The author of the book, Abū ‘Abdallāh Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, is considered to be the father of Algebra.

Yes - Algebra, the root of most of our technology, <a href="https://www.njctl.org/courses/science/algebra-based-physics/nuclear-physics/nuclear-physics-presentation/">including nuclear physics</a>, was born in Iran - once known as Persia. al-Ḵwārizmī, an orthodox Muslim, had such an enormous effect on our mathematical thinking that we invoke his name every time we use the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%E1%B8%A5ammad_ibn_M%C5%ABs%C4%81_al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB">algorithm</a>. NASA scientists<a href="http://the-moon.wikispaces.com/Al-Khwarizmi"> named a lunar crater </a>for him in honor of his contributions to science. Not only did al-Ḵwārizmī develop algebra and quadratics (a subject Sparky currently wrestles at school) but he also popularized the decimal system.  (A bit of trivia: al-Ḵwārizmī's numbering system was the subject of the first "new math" panic: it was outlawed in Italy until Fibonacci interceded in 1299)

Another famous Persian you may be more familiar with, Omar Khayyam, was much more than "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam#Cinema">people lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls"</a> While we know him best as the poet author of Marian Paroo's beloved <em>Rubaiyat</em>, in his time he was revered as a mathematician and philosopher. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Omar_Khayy.C3.A1m.27s_solution">He is known for using geometry </a>to solve third-degree equations by graphing the intersection of a parabola and a circle. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam_%28crater%29">He also has a lunar crater!</a>)

So, how do we bring this around to Pi Day? Well, among other things, al-Ḵwārizmī used his decimal place system instead of the previously used clunky fractions to calculate Pi as 3.1416 (remember that the last digit would be rounded up, right?) (the prior advance almost 300 years before was by Japanese mathematician Tsu Chung Chi: 355/113) So, this year, we use the "ultmate Pi Day" to honor the Persian contributions to math, and created a pie with tradiational Persian flavors: pistachio, rosewater and cardamom.

Since an angle is really nothing more than a section of a circle, Pi has just as much to do with corners as it has curves. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangles</a> are a deceptively simple shape: a triangle whose sides have been rounded off with curves...but using three circles to create a rounded triangle produces a nearly magical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUCSSJwO3GU">triangle of constant width</a>. You can do all kinds of cool things with a Reuleaux triangle: make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk7s4PfvCZg">non-circular wheels</a>, <a href="http://mathtourist.blogspot.com/2010/08/manhole-cover-geometry.html">manhole covers</a> that won't fall in the hole when turned, <a href="http://web.olivet.edu/~hathaway/Shape.html">coins</a> that will work in vending machines, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankel_engine">engines</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5AzbDJ7KYI">drill a square hole</a>. The area of a Reuleaux triangle is calculated as ½(π - √3)s<sup>2</sup> and although it is not the only shape of constant width, it is the smallest in area. The <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Area.html">area</a> of each curved portion of the Reuleaux triangle is a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html">circular segment</a> with opening angle 0=π/3. Thus, π figures prominently in our pie.

Since we settled on a triangle, we have to discuss our favorite triangle-shaped pastry, the Hamantaschen. A pastry of Yiddish origin, it is named for the biblical character Haman...who is, interestingly enough, Persian. The pastry is supposed to be triangle-shaped like Haman's hat, and is eaten during the Jewish holiday of Purim. As the story goes, the beautiful Queen Esther successfully prevents the royal vizier, Haman, from murdering all Jews in Persia by revealing to her husband, the King of Persia, that she is a Jew. (While this bible story leans more towards lore and less towards historical fact, the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great did indeed liberate the Jews from Babylon and allow them to return to Israel to practice their religion freely, as described in the book of Ezra.) A Persian Jewish population still exists in Iran - who, apparently, make<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YJifUu6WnKgC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;ots=ndeNA_-tWH&amp;dq=Persian%20hamantaschen&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20hamantaschen&amp;f=false"> pistachio rosewater cookies for Purim</a>.

So, we are able to tie up our math, geometry, politics and history in a neat bow with this delicious pastry that I hope you will enjoy.

Dough Ingredients
<ul>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1 stick (1/2 cup) butter</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">4 ounces (1/2 cup) cream cheese (we used neufchatel)</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1/8 - 1/4 tsp rosewater</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1 egg yolk (use a large egg)</li>
</ul>
Filling ingredients
<ul>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1 1/4 cup ground pistachios (reserve a pinch for decoration)</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">2 eggs</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">6 tablespoons butter</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">2 tablespoons flour</li>
	<li itemprop="ingredients">1 cardamom pod</li>
</ul>
Both the dough and the filling will need time to chill in the refrigerator, so plan accordingly.

Make the dough:

Add the rosewater and flour and process until the butter is the size of peas, then add the egg yolk and process until lightly blended (the dough will be shaggy.) Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and push it together until loose dry ingredients are incorporated - then refrigerate in a ziploc bag or covered container for at least an hour.

Add all the filling ingredients to your blender and blend to a smooth paste. Pour the filling into a bowl, cover it, and refrigerate for an hour or more.

Preheat your oven to 350 and set out a cookie sheet. Roll out your chilled dough to 1/8 thickness and cut it into a circle at least an inch larger than your triangle. Using the scribed aluminum foil and your springform pan as a guide for the first curved side of your triangle, fold the crust up against the side of the pan.

Spread filling from the center towards the edge supported by the pan, and then fold the crust over the filling. Repeat with the other two sides, folding the dough lightly to help it fit the curve and pinching it together firmly at each apex.

Sprinkle the top with ground pistachios, slide the tart, aluminum foil and all, onto your cookie sheet. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes, or until the filling puffs up and both crust and filling brown lightly.

Dust with powdered sugar, serve and enjoy!

<em>* The easiest way to figure out the length of the sides in relationship to your circle is to use a compass set to the length of the radius of your pan, draw an arc, then move the leg of your compass to that arc and draw another arc that intersects the first. Move the leg of your compass to the intersection point and draw a third arc that intersects the other two: you have your Reuleaux triangle.</em>

<strong>And now, my friends, on this Pi Day of Pi Days, I realize that the time has come for me to step aside and allow Sparky to write his own story. I have been keeping this chronicle of our cooking adventures for over half his life and one day I suddenly looked up and found him to be a fine, independent young man ready to veture out on his own path.</strong>

Case in point, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/09/world/middleeast/document-the-letter-senate-republicans-addressed-to-the-leaders-of-iran.html">GOP's intervention in our negotiations in Iran</a>, written in a tone that implies the people of Iran are incapable of understanding the intricacies of government, much less the complexities of nuclear physics.

As the GOP attempts to "educate" Iran, they might think about brushing up a bit on basic math. People who probably joke about "<a href="https://www.njctl.org/courses/science/algebra-based-physics/nuclear-physics/nuclear-physics-presentation/">weapons of math destruction</a>" don't realize that the word algebra, in fact, comes from the title of Persian book written somewhere around 780 AD: <i>ilm <strong>al-jabr</strong> wa'l-muḳābala</i> ‘The Science of Restoring What Is Missing and Equating Like With Like.’ (isn't that a poetic description of algebra?) The author of the book, Abū ‘Abdallāh Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, is considered to be the father of Algebra.

Yes - Algebra, the root of most of our technology, <a href="https://www.njctl.org/courses/science/algebra-based-physics/nuclear-physics/nuclear-physics-presentation/">including nuclear physics</a>, was born in Iran - once known as Persia. al-Ḵwārizmī, an orthodox Muslim, had such an enormous effect on our mathematical thinking that we invoke his name every time we use the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%E1%B8%A5ammad_ibn_M%C5%ABs%C4%81_al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB">algorithm</a>. NASA scientists<a href="http://the-moon.wikispaces.com/Al-Khwarizmi"> named a lunar crater </a>for him in honor of his contributions to science. Not only did al-Ḵwārizmī develop algebra and quadratics (a subject Sparky currently wrestles at school) but he also popularized the decimal system.  (A bit of trivia: al-Ḵwārizmī's numbering system was the subject of the first "new math" panic: it was outlawed in Italy until Fibonacci interceded in 1299)

Another famous Persian you may be more familiar with, Omar Khayyam, was much more than "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam#Cinema">people lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls"</a> While we know him best as the poet author of Marian Paroo's beloved <em>Rubaiyat</em>, in his time he was revered as a mathematician and philosopher. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Omar_Khayy.C3.A1m.27s_solution">He is known for using geometry </a>to solve third-degree equations by graphing the intersection of a parabola and a circle. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam_%28crater%29">He also has a lunar crater!</a>)

So, how do we bring this around to Pi Day? Well, among other things, al-Ḵwārizmī used his decimal place system instead of the previously used clunky fractions to calculate Pi as 3.1416 (remember that the last digit would be rounded up, right?) (the prior advance almost 300 years before was by Japanese mathematician Tsu Chung Chi: 355/113) So, this year, we use the "ultmate Pi Day" to honor the Persian contributions to math, and created a pie with tradiational Persian flavors: pistachio, rosewater and cardamom.

Since an angle is really nothing more than a section of a circle, Pi has just as much to do with corners as it has curves. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangles</a> are a deceptively simple shape: a triangle whose sides have been rounded off with curves...but using three circles to create a rounded triangle produces a nearly magical <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUCSSJwO3GU">triangle of constant width</a>. You can do all kinds of cool things with a Reuleaux triangle: make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk7s4PfvCZg">non-circular wheels</a>, <a href="http://mathtourist.blogspot.com/2010/08/manhole-cover-geometry.html">manhole covers</a> that won't fall in the hole when turned, <a href="http://web.olivet.edu/~hathaway/Shape.html">coins</a> that will work in vending machines, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankel_engine">engines</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5AzbDJ7KYI">drill a square hole</a>. The area of a Reuleaux triangle is calculated as ½(π - √3)s<sup>2</sup> and although it is not the only shape of constant width, it is the smallest in area. The <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Area.html">area</a> of each curved portion of the Reuleaux triangle is a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html">circular segment</a> with opening angle 0=π/3. Thus, π figures prominently in our pie.

Since we settled on a triangle, we have to discuss our favorite triangle-shaped pastry, the Hamantaschen. A pastry of Yiddish origin, it is named for the biblical character Haman...who is, interestingly enough, Persian. The pastry is supposed to be triangle-shaped like Haman's hat, and is eaten during the Jewish holiday of Purim.

Sparky and his Dad are avid gamers, if late adopters - they just worked their way through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Portal</a>. I'd first heard about this video game on one of my very favorite blogs, <a href="http://www.epbot.com/2011/09/play-portal-for-free-finally-get-cake.html">Epbot </a>(from the creators of <a href="http://www.cakewrecks.com/home/2011/10/11/the-future-is-now-and-its-talking-smack.html">Cake Wrecks</a>, another blog so well worth reading that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cake-Wrecks-Professional-Cakes-Hilariously/dp/0740785370">it's a book,</a> too - and one of Sparky's favorites!) To make a long story short, it involves a homicidal computer that bribes you with promises of cake. As you find your way through the game, you find that <i><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-cake-is-a-lie">the cake is a lie</a></i>...

It's not just any cake. It's <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/31/let-there-be-cake.aspx">THIS cake:</a> apparently it's based on a Black Forest Cake from the Regent Bakery and Cafe in Redmond, WA. Ours is going to be a bit more complicated, with bonus "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter eggs</a>" (that's <em>common-speak gamer</em>, <em>n00bs</em>.) I hope you'll follow me on this slightly-odd baking ride...

To ensure accuracy (since I'm not about to spend twelve hours beating a game just to get a cake recipe,) I emailed the only Portal Cake expert I know: the incredibly gracious Jen from Epbot - to ask if the inside of the cake is ever shown. Jen and her husband John are lovely people who answer weird emails from <a href="http://quipstravailsandbraisedoxtails.blogspot.com/2011/04/food-desert-project-bronxzooscobra-cake.html">very odd</a> cake-obsessed fans, and graciously replied that you always see the whole cake, so I could fill it any way I like. Sparky, however,<i> insists</i> that their expert advice is wrong because at the very end of the game, "where GLaDOS is singing," you see a cut cake slice, showing chocolate cake and white filling. Well, as I'm me - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrJKHKUupjQ">I looked it up</a>. Sparky's been learning to code recently and must have developed a supernatural ability to convert alphanumeric characters into flavors. Apparently the hashtag symbol = white filling.

Since Sparky knows where I live, I'm going with his idea. <i>(Sparky: "I <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span></strong> know where you live. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And</span></strong> I have Nerf.")</i>

I used a recipe dear to my heart - my grandmother's "famous" chocolate cake, written out as a wedding present for my mother on a now-precious scrap of paper.(Four generations of cake lovers involved in this photo...)

The recipe is fairly easy, although as my grandmother notes, it does make a fairly small single-layer cake. I'm usually worried more about too much cake than too little, so I made the single layer and split and filled it, but if you want a taller cake like the one in the game, double the recipe and put it in two pans. (Sparky asked me to point out that the cake in the game has three layers. We made two.)

<b>Cake ingredients:</b>

2 squares of unsweetened chocolate
¼ lb butter (1 stick)
2 eggs, separated
1 cup sugar
1 cup flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
½ cup milk
1 tsp vanilla

Prepare an 8" springform cake pan by coating it in butter and then dusting with flour.

<a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="003 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755757684/"><img alt="003" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7755757684_3516d2feae_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>Melt the chocolate and butter together slowly in the microwave and combine until completely smooth and liquid - DO NOT OVERCOOK.

Add 2 egg yolks and 1 cup of sugar to your mixing bowl and whisk until combined. Add the chocolate and whisk well.

In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the milk and flour to the chocolate in two alternate batches, mixing until just combined.

<a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="006 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755757368/"><img alt="006" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7755757368_b9d47dcced_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>In yet another bowl, whip the egg whites until they reach soft peaks, and fold them into the batter with the vanilla. (I am lazy: I whip the egg whites first and set them aside so I can reuse the bowl, but it does lose you some volume. Definitely don't try it on a humid day.) Pour into your prepared cake pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

<i>(BTW - this mixing bowl is special - it's our second-prize prize for the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/contest/piday2012/">Serious Eats/Instructables Pi Day Challenge</a>! Yay!)</i>

Our first attempt (at which Sparky did so well, too!) involved a new springform pan with an apparently loose hinge. <i>That </i>particular cake <i>was</i> a lie.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="009 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755756762/"><img alt="009" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8424/7755756762_6462a3bdd8_z.jpg" width="320" height="320" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
Undaunted, we rescued the crumbs and set them aside for other uses, and started over (fortunately, it's not a complex recipe.) We set the new cake aside for several hours to cool.
<br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /> Since rhubarb is so prominently featured in the Portal Cake recipe, plus I love it, we worked it into the filling: Sour Cherry-Rhubarb Cream:

<b>Filling ingredients</b>
<b>
</b>2 cups pitted sour cherries (we used frozen unsweetened)
1/2 cup rhubarb in large dice (I also used frozen)
1 1/2 cup sugar or more as needed
1 pint of very cold whipping cream
1/4 tsp plain gelatin powder
2 tbsp vanilla sugar
1 dark chocolate bar
(<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/313528/mascarpone-frosting">Marscapone Frosting</a> - 1 tub marscapone, 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar)

In a heavy saucepan on medium heat, cook the cherries in the sugar until they release their juices, soften, and the sugar dissolves into a syrup. Add the rhubarb and continue to cook for about a minute. Taste a piece of rhubarb and see if it's tender and sweet enough to eat as-is. Drain, putting the solids in the freezer to cool, and put the liquid back into the pot and boil until reduced by half.

Pour half the cream into your mixing bowl and sprinkle it with the gelatin powder and vanilla sugar. Wait for 5 minutes. Whisk the cream until it reaches the soft-peak stage. Refrigerate.

Now, carefully remove your cake from the pan and slice it in half into two circles using a long, serrated knife (I find that if you turn the cake as you slice, you are more likely to get two even slices.) Wash out your cake pan and dry it carefully. Put the bottom layer back in the cake pan.

<a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="026 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755755726/"><img alt="026" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7755755726_228bcb9170_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>I used the cake crumbs from our destroyed layer to create a "dam" around the outside of the filling in the cake pan, as filling is notoriously difficult to frost. I then sprinkled the cake layer with a bit of the reduced cherry syrup, and coated the layer with the cooled and drained cherry-rhubarb pieces.

The whipped cream was poured on top and spread out to the edges; I used the spatula to remove air pockets and mix in the filling a bit. The top layer was sprinkled with syrup, gingerly put over the whole thing, and the pan was wrapped in aluminum foil and put into the freezer overnight.

Where is Sparky during all this? Well, he was busy making our "easter egg" chocolate shavings: following the "recipe" dictated by the game, using melted chocolate in a ziploc bag with a tiny hole as a pen, he piped a series of chocolate fish, as well as a <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/Subsurface/factshts/ert/cbem.pdf">cross borehole electro-magnetic imaging rhubarb</a>, all kinds of needles and injectors, cranial caps, an <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1303&amp;bih=683&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=i8r9g0I7tiKDUM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v23n2/p06.html&amp;docid=uDoiJlpN6PwprM&amp;imgurl=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v23n2/Physics%25252023-2%252520Images-Web/KLEIN.jpg&amp;w=541&amp;h=412&amp;ei=mZclUMO3K4qu8QSqzoGQBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=207&amp;vpy=324&amp;dur=99&amp;hovh=196&amp;hovw=257&amp;tx=83&amp;ty=117&amp;sig=114111335068344253355&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=154&amp;tbnw=202&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=19&amp;ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:95">adjustable aluminum head positioner,</a> and

We took out the frozen cake and coated it thoroughly with the frosting, (this is often known as a "crumb coat," but since we're covering it with chocolate sprinkles, we don't need to stop and refrigerate,) reserving about a cup for the piped garnish.

<a style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="001 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7760134124/"><img alt="001" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7760134124_6e5a5bd48d_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>Sparky shaved a bar of dark chocolate with a vegetable peeler until we had enough chocolate shavings to thoroughly coat the cake and hide our "easter eggs."

<a style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="005 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7760132194/"><img alt="005" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8448/7760132194_1728494f44_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>He carefully pressed the chocolate shavings into the sides of the cake, and then sprinkled the remaining shavings on the top - after which we added our chocolate drawings.

<a style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="012 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7760129534/"><img alt="012" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7760129534_23f187cb3b_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>We piped dollops of icing around the top, and put a cherry on top of each one. (Despite Sparky's strenuous objections, I used fresh sweet cherries.)

<a style="clear: left; cssfloat: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="020 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7760127788/"><img alt="020" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7760127788_54ea373734_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>We tried something really cool that wound up being a fail: I cut aluminum foil into a circle (<a href="http://quipstravailsandbraisedoxtails.blogspot.com/2010/12/food-desert-project-tortilla-paisana.html">square into circle instructions here)</a> and made it into a well, which we pressed into the icing on the top of the cake. This was filled with warm vodka. My intent was to light it with a match so it looks like an <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1303&amp;bih=683&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=1e8rDji1IJfnwM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.hrudu.com/that-portal-thing/&amp;docid=LZ6VXeGclDrMZM&amp;imgurl=http://www.hrudu.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/portal_11841397761.jpg&amp;w=480&amp;h=360&amp;ei=AJYlUKyWOYik8gTf8YDICg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=195&amp;vpy=157&amp;dur=2142&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=137&amp;ty=67&amp;sig=114111335068344253355&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=149&amp;tbnw=208&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:76">exit portal</a> (in theory it should burn blue.) Or, it could set the entire cake...or the room on fire...Sadly, we ran into the opposite problem: chocolate melts at about 86 degrees, and the flashpoint of alcohol is about 75 degrees. I decided that keeping our cake nicely cold and unmelted was more important than flaming a portal...but y'all are free to experiment with this idea. We tried it several times, lighting it several ways (the lighter burned the icing, we found that a lit strand of spaghetti theoretically worked best.) but it only worked once, and briefly.

Plus, the idea of lighting a cake on fire at a firehouse...well, that's pressure I don't need on a delightful sunny day. We live to flame another day! Your moment of cake zen:

I used a recipe dear to my heart - my grandmother's "famous" chocolate cake, written out as a wedding present for my mother on a now-precious scrap of paper.(Four generations of cake lovers involved in this photo...)

The recipe is fairly easy, although as my grandmother notes, it does make a fairly small single-layer cake. I'm usually worried more about too much cake than too little, so I made the single layer and split and filled it, but if you want a taller cake like the one in the game, double the recipe and put it in two pans. (Sparky asked me to point out that the cake in the game has three layers. We made two.)

<b>Cake ingredients:</b>

2 squares of unsweetened chocolate
¼ lb butter (1 stick)
2 eggs, separated
1 cup sugar
1 cup flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
½ cup milk
1 tsp vanilla

Prepare an 8" springform cake pan by coating it in butter and then dusting with flour.

<a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="003 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755757684/"><img alt="003" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8292/7755757684_3516d2feae_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>Melt the chocolate and butter together slowly in the microwave and combine until completely smooth and liquid - DO NOT OVERCOOK.

Add 2 egg yolks and 1 cup of sugar to your mixing bowl and whisk until combined. Add the chocolate and whisk well.

In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the milk and flour to the chocolate in two alternate batches, mixing until just combined.

<a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="006 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755757368/"><img alt="006" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7755757368_b9d47dcced_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>In yet another bowl, whip the egg whites until they reach soft peaks, and fold them into the batter with the vanilla. (I am lazy: I whip the egg whites first and set them aside so I can reuse the bowl, but it does lose you some volume. Definitely don't try it on a humid day.) Pour into your prepared cake pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

<i>(BTW - this mixing bowl is special - it's our second-prize prize for the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/contest/piday2012/">Serious Eats/Instructables Pi Day Challenge</a>! Yay!)</i>

Our first attempt (at which Sparky did so well, too!) involved a new springform pan with an apparently loose hinge. <i>That </i>particular cake <i>was</i> a lie.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
Undaunted, we rescued the crumbs and set them aside for other uses, and started over (fortunately, it's not a complex recipe.) We set the new cake aside for several hours to cool.
<br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /> Since rhubarb is so prominently featured in the Portal Cake recipe, plus I love it, we worked it into the filling: Sour Cherry-Rhubarb Cream:

<b>Filling ingredients</b>
<b>
</b>2 cups pitted sour cherries (we used frozen unsweetened)
1/2 cup rhubarb in large dice (I also used frozen)
1 1/2 cup sugar or more as needed
1 pint of very cold whipping cream
1/4 tsp plain gelatin powder
2 tbsp vanilla sugar
1 dark chocolate bar
(<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/313528/mascarpone-frosting">Marscapone Frosting</a> - 1 tub marscapone, 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar)

In a heavy saucepan on medium heat, cook the cherries in the sugar until they release their juices, soften, and the sugar dissolves into a syrup. Add the rhubarb and continue to cook for about a minute. Taste a piece of rhubarb and see if it's tender and sweet enough to eat as-is. Drain, putting the solids in the freezer to cool, and put the liquid back into the pot and boil until reduced by half.

Pour half the cream into your mixing bowl and sprinkle it with the gelatin powder and vanilla sugar. Wait for 5 minutes. Whisk the cream until it reaches the soft-peak stage. Refrigerate.

Now, carefully remove your cake from the pan and slice it in half into two circles using a long, serrated knife (I find that if you turn the cake as you slice, you are more likely to get two even slices.) Wash out your cake pan and dry it carefully. Put the bottom layer back in the cake pan.

<a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="026 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7755755726/"><img alt="026" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8304/7755755726_228bcb9170_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>I used the cake crumbs from our destroyed layer to create a "dam" around the outside of the filling in the cake pan, as filling is notoriously difficult to frost. I then sprinkled the cake layer with a bit of the reduced cherry syrup, and coated the layer with the cooled and drained cherry-rhubarb pieces.

The whipped cream was poured on top and spread out to the edges; I used the spatula to remove air pockets and mix in the filling a bit. The top layer was sprinkled with syrup, gingerly put over the whole thing, and the pan was wrapped in aluminum foil and put into the freezer overnight.

Where is Sparky during all this? Well, he was busy making our "easter egg" chocolate shavings: following the "recipe" dictated by the game, using melted chocolate in a ziploc bag with a tiny hole as a pen, he piped a series of chocolate fish, as well as a <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/Subsurface/factshts/ert/cbem.pdf">cross borehole electro-magnetic imaging rhubarb</a>, all kinds of needles and injectors, cranial caps, an <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1303&amp;bih=683&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=i8r9g0I7tiKDUM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v23n2/p06.html&amp;docid=uDoiJlpN6PwprM&amp;imgurl=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v23n2/Physics%25252023-2%252520Images-Web/KLEIN.jpg&amp;w=541&amp;h=412&amp;ei=mZclUMO3K4qu8QSqzoGQBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=207&amp;vpy=324&amp;dur=99&amp;hovh=196&amp;hovw=257&amp;tx=83&amp;ty=117&amp;sig=114111335068344253355&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=154&amp;tbnw=202&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=19&amp;ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:95">adjustable aluminum head positioner,</a> and

We took out the frozen cake and coated it thoroughly with the frosting, (this is often known as a "crumb coat," but since we're covering it with chocolate sprinkles, we don't need to stop and refrigerate,) reserving about a cup for the piped garnish.

<a style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="001 by michelehays, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michelehaysdobson/7760134124/"><img alt="001" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7760134124_6e5a5bd48d_m.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>Sparky shaved a bar of dark chocolate with a vegetable peeler until we had enough chocolate shavings to thoroughly coat the cake and hide our "easter eggs."

(Despite Sparky's strenuous objections, I used fresh sweet cherries.)

This was filled with warm vodka. My intent was to light it with a match so it looks like an <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1303&amp;bih=683&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=1e8rDji1IJfnwM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.hrudu.com/that-portal-thing/&amp;docid=LZ6VXeGclDrMZM&amp;imgurl=http://www.hrudu.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/portal_11841397761.jpg&amp;w=480&amp;h=360&amp;ei=AJYlUKyWOYik8gTf8YDICg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=195&amp;vpy=157&amp;dur=2142&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=137&amp;ty=67&amp;sig=114111335068344253355&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=149&amp;tbnw=208&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:76">exit portal</a> (in theory it should burn blue.) Or, it could set the entire cake...or the room on fire...Sadly, we ran into the opposite problem: chocolate melts at about 86 degrees, and the flashpoint of alcohol is about 75 degrees. I decided that keeping our cake nicely cold and unmelted was more important than flaming a portal...but y'all are free to experiment with this idea. We tried it several times, lighting it several ways (the lighter burned the icing, we found that a lit strand of spaghetti theoretically worked best.) but it only worked once, and briefly.

Plus, the idea of lighting a cake on fire at a firehouse...well, that's pressure I don't need on a delightful sunny day. We live to flame another day! Your moment of cake zen:

Sparky, Zuko and I dove right in:  we decided that the heavy, wet batter was going to need more lift than just self-rising flour, so first we separated the eggs and whipped the 4 egg whites until they made soft peaks. (did you ever wonder if rattlesnakes could use those things as whisks? ) The fluffy whites went into a clean bowl, and then the butter and sugar went into the mixer and were whipped until well incorporated... then we added the egg yolks and milk and whipped it some more.Then came the flour, added slowly with the mixer on low.

This made for a quite deep single layer.Since the cobra left us to guess about baking times, I popped the cake into a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes, then turned it down to 300 and allowed it to bake for an additional 30 minutes, until the center top set (note: the center will rise and then cave in a bit; this is typical of egg-white-leavened cakes and why you want a tube pan. Make sure it's firm to the touch before you remove it from the oven.)</div>

I learned a lot from that dish, mainly that the trick is to let tofu be itself, and not pretend it's eggs or cream or meat.

These sandwiches are one of our favorite ways to eat tofu, and a great way to get started if you've never tried it before. We're lucky to live not too far from an excellent <a href="http://www.nhulansbakery.com/">Bánh Mi shop</a> that sells all manner of Vietnamese "sub" sandwiches in all kinds of combinations: ham, paté, cold cuts, grilled pork, eggs veggies...and one made with lemongrass tofu. I'm not sure how the flavor profile works, but somehow the marinade imbues the tofu with a very meaty, umami-rich flavor that makes it perfect on a sandwich but somehow doesn't deny its tofu-ness.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/quips-travails-braised-oxtails/files/2014/07/IMG_2376.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2441" style="margin-right: 10px;" alt="IMG_2376" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/quips-travails-braised-oxtails/files/2014/07/IMG_2376-300x300.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>I had no idea these were so simple to make, you just need to make sure you have firm, water-packed tofu, the kind with a slightly spongy texture (not "silken" tofu.) You also need lemongrass, which you can get in a grocery store, but which wasn't quite mature in our garden yet. We substituted lime basil which works just fine. Lemon basil or lemon balm will work, too, but they are stronger in flavor.

<strong>Ingredients</strong>

Firm (or Chinese-style) tofu
About 1/2 cup lime basil sprigs
2 garlic cloves
2 tsp salt (don't skip this, tofu has almost no salt and will be bland without it)
ground black pepper to taste
2 tsp sesame oil
2 tsp vegetable oil
5 tsp soy sauce
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/quips-travails-braised-oxtails/2014/07/sundays-with-sparky-salted-mizuna-and-nukazuke-style-pickled-turnips/">Turnip pickles</a>
Carrots (or carrots and daikon radish if you don't have turnip pickles in your fridge like you should.) ;-)
Vinegar bath for carrots:  1 tbsp sugar and 3/4 tsp salt dissolved in 1 cup water and 2 tablespoons rice vinegar

Lettuce
Cucumbers
Basil or cilantro leaves
Crusty french rolls
Mayo
Sriracha or chili garlic paste

&nbsp;

Then we balanced a second loaf pan on top of the tofu bricks and piled heavy cans on top of that to press out as much of the liquid as possible.  After the first pressing, we removed the paper towels and did it again, leaving it while we prepped the marinade.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/quips-travails-braised-oxtails/files/2014/07/IMG_2378.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2442" style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="IMG_2378" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/quips-travails-braised-oxtails/files/2014/07/IMG_2378-300x300.jpg" width="200" height="200" /></a>

&nbsp;

Sparky went out into the garden and clipped lime basil until he had loosely filled our small mortar.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He then topped it with two garlic cloves and the salt, and mashed it up until it was a homogeneous glop. He then measured in the oils and soy sauce and gave it a thorough stir.

&nbsp;

After pouring off any remaining water from the tofu, Sparky cut it into planks about 1/2 an inch thick.  He layered these back into the loaf pan, drizzling each layer with the marinade and finally pouring the remainder over the top. Once again, we set the second loaf pan and the cans on top and set the whole thing in the refrigerator for an hour.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We poured the marinade over the top and set those in the refrigerator with the tofu.

&nbsp;

I tell you, these sandwiches are a gateway drug: once you try them you will crave tofu instead of looking at it askance!  Enjoy!

I'd read this idea and was eager to try it.

I had pre-made and packed an applesauce muffin mix - simple enough, and requiring only a few additions to prepare it:

For the mix:

1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 tablespoons quick cooking oats

(note: save a bit of the mix for dusting the bottom of each orange)

To prepare, add:

<div>1 cup unsweetened applesauce plus 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</div>
<div>1/2 cup oil or melted butter</div>

<div>So, I set Sparky to combining the mix and wet ingredients with our camp whisk while I prepared the oranges:</div>

<div></div>
Then, I cut a small conical section out of each orange, to reach the rest of the insides more easily.  After that, I cut around the inside of the orange and lifted it out in semicircle-like sections, and scraped the remaining pulp from the bottom with the point of my knife.

<div>We then peeled the foil away, and had beautiful applesauce muffins in our oranges.  Delicious!  The scent of orange zest filled the whole campsite, and the muffins were moist and smoky and hot and apple-orangey.   Quite the pleasant wake-up call when you're camping in the North Woods - and you can squeeze the orange pulp in a cheesecloth and have fresh OJ to go with your muffin.</div>
