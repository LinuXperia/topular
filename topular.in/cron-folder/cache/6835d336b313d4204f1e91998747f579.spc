As a survivor and as a human being who loves all people pediatric cancer saddens and angers me. How in the hell is it allowed that a child is allowed to get cancer? Cancer robbed me of the ability to have my own children but I have step children and I would fight fucking fire to save them.

Today is Donna Day 2016 it is a call to action to donate money and fight pediatric cancer. If you are unfamiliar with Donna's story <a href="www.chicagonow.com/mary-tyler-mom/donnas-cancer-story-2/" target="_blank">here</a> is a link to her whole story from my friend Mary Tyler Mom. Her and her husband somehow got through this loss and their strength never wavered. 

There are many ways to donate, in fact, on March 19th there is a <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/events/mypage/6969/2016">St. Baldrick's</a> event happening at Candlelite Chicago you can click the link to the event page to donate to Donna's Good Things or you can click <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/donate/event/6969/2016" target="_blank">here</a> to go straight to the donation page.

I've been a part of two St. Baldrick events. I've donated money and I've been a shavee. I never knew Donna but I know her mom. Every time I embrace her I send my love to her and her family. Donna's story is devastating. It feels unfair. Donna's Good Things is a wonderful charity that is a gift from Donna. All I know about Donna is what I've read and heard about her. She was a sweet little girl who never seemed to let on that she was suffering or was scared. 

Her spirit survives through DGT. I'm going to donate to team DGT because well as I said before fuck cancer! Fuck it so much! Fuck you, cancer, for all the children you make suffer. Fuck you for all the children you steal. Fuck you for the millions of adults and children who suffer.

I know what cancer feels like. I know that cancer does what it can to steal life and joy. I'm choosing hope. I chose hope almost 20 years ago when I was first diagnosed and then 5 years later when I had a recurrence. I lived to write about cancer and to make jokes at its expense in my stand up.

Cancer tries to win but with survivors living on, in remembrance of those we have lost along the way, and because of the kindness of those who can donate my hope is that in my lifetime I'll get to see cancer lose. Please donate if you can. Pediatric cancer has a target on its back. Let's unleash our arsenal.

Like a lot of others who utilize social media I searched for the right words to say. The "right" words don't exist so I went with my heart.

I like many others played David Bowie throughout the day. Bowie was always in the shuffle but today I played him over and over. I fell back in love with songs I hadn't listened to in ages I listened with sadness, I also listened with fondness. I danced when no one was home. I listened to someone who was a part of the soundtrack for decades.

For 18 months he lived with cancer. I suppose in that respect his death wasn't sudden. To the rest of us outside of his world it was. Cancer was our tragic common bond. My good morning turned to mourning when I learned of his death. I was sad I am sad but I feel lucky that we shared the same air once.

I was lucky to see him live in 2002 before his heart attack which helped him to decide to discontinue touring in 2004. I watched in awe. He was just about 30 feet in front of me. He seemed like a giant. The man knew how to perform. It felt untreal I was in the audience watching David Bowie. 

This nerd was watching a man from another planet. My hero was right there. No one else existed. In my world I was the only person there. It was one of the best shows I'd ever seen. 

From Ziggy to Lazarus Bowie was a star for almost 50 years. He played with gender roles he played with fashion. He set standards in music and in performance. He is the creation of smashing art and music together. He will live on forever in his art. For that those of us who loved his music his legacy runs deep. I found Bowie when I needed him. 

Ziggy is out there in the ether still playing guitar.

Goodbye, David, the world is a little darker today but the stars are a little brighter.

Lemmy was the star in Foo Fighters White Limo video.

If you saw the movie Airheads you know the answer to the question of who would win in a wrestling match, Lemmy or God? The correct answer to this trick question is Lemmy is God.

Lemmy never cared about stardom. He lived by his own rules and screamed to the machine gun beat of his own drum. Lemmy used his middle finger as a punctuation mark and would hate a post reminiscing on his life so instead here's a tale about I was inadvertently knocked out by Lemmy.

I went through a small period of time where I was into the band Anthrax. I was invited to go see Anthrax and Motörhead. I think the show was at The Metro but it could have been the House of Blues as well. Either way I was in my mid twenties and had enough energy at the time to agree to go.

I'm a skinny dude with glasses so I avoided mosh pits like I avoided sleeveless black t-shirts. This was a show that the whole floor was a mosh pit so I did my best to stay on the fringe. I was unsuccessful.

As soon as Motörhead took the stage the opening riff for Ace of Spades would be all I'd get to hear as I was pushed into the mosh pit and fell helplessly to the ground like skin and bones would. While I was on the ground someone tripped over me and fell on the back of my head. All I heard were birds tweeting and all I saw were stars.

I missed the only Motörhead song I knew. Fuck!

Some hero saw my sad pitiful self in a heap on the floor and pulled me up and I walked off. I found a bathroom and threw water on my face then bought a beer and a water. Water first and beer second. My dickhole friends watched all of Motörhead before they looked for me and found me. They asked how I was doing. I said that I wasn't sure and we went home. 

Rest in peace, Lemmy, you were my first and last knockout and my first and last mosh pit. That is somehow a very poetic eulogy.

Lemmy was the lead singer for heavy metal icon, Motörhead. I will admit I don't know much about Lemmy or Motörhead I just know his affect on pop culture and bands who most were influenced by him.

Lemmy was the star in Foo Fighters White Limo video.

Donald Trump chose that day to say he is in favor of a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-donald-trump-muslims-shutdown-20151207-story.html" target="_blank">complete shutdown</a> of the immigration of Muslims AND that he would ban Americans who are also Muslim from returning to the country. It wasn't the first time I asked "Is Trump fucking crazy?" It is not likely to be the last but so far it is the most outrageous.

What is even more outrageous is that some people who were in attendance and those follow him like lambs to the slaughter actually agreed with this crazy statement. You'd love to think this will prevent Trump from running for President but even if he doesn't win the Republican nomination he is likely to run as an Independent. That'd be fine with me because that's the biggest favor he could do for the future democratic candidate.

Maybe that is his plan. Maybe this is how he is going to help liberals win. I'm in favor of at least another four years of a Democrat as President. The yes men in charge of Trump's campaign need to take a break from saying yes and explaining the dufference between radical and not radical. There are Muslims enrolled in US military. Everyday they are fighting side by side with Christians, Catholics, Buddhists, et cetera. 

The attacks in San Bernadino last week are deplorable just as all terrorist attacks are deplorable. Segregation due to religion, race, or for any reason is just wrong. Our fore fathers escaped England to come to America for religious freedom. 

All religions have cowardly extremists. The Westboro Baptist "Church" actively thanks God for the death of US troops and protests US troop funerals because God supposedly hates homosexuals. I myself was raised Roman Catholic but I don't identify as such any longer because I believe in love and tolerance of all people. I believe in a higher power but I don't know that I assign a name to that higher power. I believe in science. I believe science created our whole universe and that religion came after.

We should be worried about extremists and those who take their version of the Good Book too literally. Hell, even Kirk Cameron is an extremist, a radical. I don't hear Donald Trump calling for the former Growing Pains star be disallowed from the country. Even what Donny Trump said is idealogical extremism. 

Donny is a fear mongerer who preaches to the lowest common denominator, they are the ugliest of Americans. They don't show up on Election Day because they are too focused on what is actually intense racism rather than religion. They throw the bible and use it as a weapon because their brains are too small to think for themselves. Donald has only done one thing and that is expose the awfulness in this country. He feeds on it. His lead depends on it. He should not be be President because he exposes the worst in Americans.

Donald and his supporters are a joke which lacks a punchline. He is a fake and will tell you as much years from now when his bid to be President fails. The shittiest part of all is that whomever gets elected will have to strengthen our relations with Muslims. You don't have to agree with any religion's values but to pin all Muslims as terrorists is not only way of base but disregards those within any religion who hold hatred as a value or part of their screwed up moral system.

I should be clear I'm not a stalker. Stalkers write what they believe will be secret letters to the ones they admire. I am making my want public as fuck. I'm standing outside Eddie Vedder's bedroom window holding a boom box blaring In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel. I'm speaking metaphorically of course. Eddie deserves better like Celine Dion or Mumford and his sons.

Did you guys know that Pearl Jam covered Sleeping By Myself which first appeared on Eddie Vedder's Ukulele Songs album and Eddie Vedder covered Can't Keep which originally appeared on Pearl Jam's Riot Act album? Only Eddie's best friend knows that. I bet you guys didn't even know there was an album after Vitalogy. There are several!

I even bought a shitty bootleg of supposed rare songs by Pearl Jam because I thought it would be cool. Only until it was in my CD player did I realize my error. Even so I still have it. Why? I have no idea. Anyway, Eddie, be my best friend I'm very close to moving on to Johnny Depp.

Playboy is/was a rite of passage for many a young man and I'm sure young women. For many of us it was the first time we saw a naked girl. Scott Flanders, it is difficult not to picture Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, stated “You’re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it’s just passé at this juncture.” As true as that is Playboy is a gateway for curiosity without worry of computer viruses or pop up ads.

Many will recall their first experience with Playboy. I remember going to my neighbor's house and he found his dad's stash. We were limited on time because his mom went to the store and could have been home at any time. So we sat and tried to figure out which magazines we should look at to make the most of our time. 

We were giddy. We giggled our way through it because we were pre-teens looking at naked women. We were too young to have feelings, you know, down there. We were old enough to know not to do it but young enough to giggle nervously. We looked through a few before my friend go worried and put them away. After that it was like him and I needed our fix. Anytime his mom left us alone we would find more and our eyes would pop out of our skulls and our jaws would hit the floor.

As puberty hit nudity became no laughing matter. I needed to find a way to get my visual drug but I was too young and the Internet was still in its infancy. Many my age remember the 56k modem days of 10-12 hours needed to download one photo only to lose connection or to find that woman had clothes on. Clothes on? What the bleep! I bleeped myself because I didn't swear at that age. So many teens dodging ads that would pop up as they feverishly tried to close each one in some kind of twisted video game.

Before I had access to Playboy I would feed my masturbatory monster by stealing department store catalogues from the Sunday paper. Honestly when you first discover your penis is not just for peeing there isn't much that wouldn't get you off. I remember seeing women in bras big enough they seemed to be shirts by today's standard and using my imagination to remove the underwear and let the magic happen.

Most around my age who had cable also remember the scrambled porn channels which you could hear and even sometimes see the action without paying for porn channels. Watching scrambled porn channels may have damaged my eyes forever. All boys and some women should have to go through these rough times before they can fully appreciate the art of pornography. 

Ha ha I called it art. It is art like a soup can of soup next to a rubber duck is a sculpture protesting freedom of religion. I'll never understand why some porn mags or porn films needed stories or scripts. I don't care why the couple, group, or town were about to do "it" just get to the doing it. Fast forwarding was tedious.

I do have a fast forwarding story. Me and a pal found his dad's porn video stash and decided to watch it. We were so worried about getting caught we fast forwarded through the whole video even the sex scenes. It scarred us for awhile. Sex that fast looked uncomfortable and painful. No one should have sex at such a speed. Some may finish within a minute like the dude in the scenes we fast forwarded through but that is okay it <em>happens to everyone yadda yadda.</em>

So what now for Playboy? The magazine will still feature women in provocative poses but without nudity. Now when people say they read Playboy for the articles it really will be for the articles. This is a sad day for all teens, men, and some women. Sure there is porn for any occasion available for free on the internet but the mystique will take a hit.

Playboy is making a selfish decision. This will certainly affect the partially black plastic magazine mailing packaging industry. No doubt these companies will fail and fold. The economy will worsen. The world will need porn to get through these times of trouble.

Here is the "old man" soap box rant. Teens today can find whatever weird circus porn their into with a simple Google search and the right key words, the right keywords are important! It shouldn't be that easy. Porn is supposed to be a hidden treasure in your or your neighbor's dad's closet. It is supposed to be poorly hidden calling out to you until you can't resist. Getting caught be damned I need to look at fake boobs and heavily airbrushed vaginas!

Playboy will no longer provide that. Now it is just the remnants of trees that died in vain.

I will be honest with you what I thought was reality almost set in and I thought it might be implausible. I mean he is Eddie Vedder lead singer of iconic band Pearl Jam and I am soon to be world renown blogger slash comedian, Patrick O'Hara. Yeah I typed out the slash because it sounds cooler when you say slash read it.

So right I had almost given up hope.

Almost...

Until my lovely fiancée searched for Eddie Vedder's best friend. The image at the top of this post is proof. The first image you see? Me! The first non-image result? This here blog. Pay no mind to the other images they are not relevant. A busy dude like Ed, yep, we are so tight that I call him Ed, has time for just one best friend. I didn't declare it Google did. Most people who like news about Eddie Vedder and his best friend trust Google. 

I understand some might ask big E, also something I am only allowed to call him, and he might deny it. It is okay I don't have to prove it to anyone and I've asked him not to confirm it because I like my privacy. This blog doesn't serve as me trying to prove it or beg but to boast that I was right and I might be a little better than some of you.

I am worried now that it is Google official I am going be awfully busy with interviews. Any moment now Anderson Cooper and Debra Norville will be requesting hour long specials. I'm making it known now we aren't doing interviews or specials. Jealous types will say I sound like a stalker or I'm delusional. To those people I thumb my nose at you. 

He likes to surf. I'm learning to surf. Surfing on lakes is nearly impossible but I've been watching some great tutorials on YouTube. Judging by how well I've been doing in the neighbors' pool while they are at work I'm keeping balance pretty well. That is really all surfing is, catching a gnarly wave then balancing, brah. Brah is a term used by surfers and is applicable to both men and women.

You might wonder what my favorite Pearl Jam song is. Well it has not been written yet. Ed will ask me at some point to help him write it. I shouldn't really be writing about it but there will be so many rumors after the Google results go public. I did not make them public it was bound to happen after election season was over and after the Kardashians become too basic for anyone to care.

I wish I could go back in time and tell 14 year old me he would think this was bitchin' news. I sometimes wish it wasn't true because whenever I go out in public I have to disguise myself because I hear the whispers speculating if I am Eddie's best friend. I have a joke he think is hilarious sometimes when I wake up my hair is long and wavy I tell him I woke with Ved-head he laughs for so many whole seconds.

Yeah it is pretty awesome being Eddie Vedder's best friend. In fact I'll use mine and my fiancées favorite expression to express how rad it is.

It doesn't get Eddie Vedder than this.

Tony was my first friend. He might have at one point been my best friend. Honestly I have very vague memories of our friendship. Not to say I didn't treasure our time but I was young. We saw each other basically everyday. You can be complacent at that age even with a friend who is constant until one day he isn't.

I didn't lose him in a tragic hide and seek accident where I forgot to seek. My parents just moved. Kids, this was a time before cell phones and computers. This was an age when if you wanted to hang out with someone you took a chance and knocked on a door, crossed your fingers, and hoped that walking downstairs wasn't a waste of time. Then you'd have to trudge all the stairs and sit wistfully for the loud sounds of his return.

Tony was a good kid. We had fun we played with Star Wars action figures. I had no idea what I was doing because I hadn't seen the "holy" trinity until my 20s. I didn't know the importance of who shot first. I just knew they were toys and we make pew pew sounds with guns and I would clang clang with the swords because I didn't know what a life saver sounded like. Yep, for the longest time I thought it was called life saver and not a light saber. Whatever life saver makes sense too.

We would hang out when our parents would have parties. I remember pictures of us hanging out. He would have a visor on and I had on overall shorts. At least there is a picture out there somewhere of us in that attire. He wore more than a visor I just can't remember what.

When Facebook became a thing he was one of the first people I looked up. I never did find him. Maybe he is in with a different name or maybe he doesn't have an account. Even worse maybe he still uses MySpace. One of my favorite things about social media is reconnecting with people who I've lost touch with. I'd be lying if I didn't say I am curious where life has taken him. 

He'd probably be pretty stoked to find out I'm a comedian. I mean being a comedian is pretty cool. Maybe he owns a club and he would book me. Maybe he is a comedian too and we will go on tour and tell the zany tale about how we reconnected after almost 30 years of not knowing each other. 

Tony Garritano, my spelling is probably wrong, was a cool kid. He might be cool gent now. It would be cool to reconnect with him. I'm not saying we would hang out and play with Star Wars toys even though I'd know what I'm doing now. I would want to be Vader because who wouldn't want to be Vader.

Tony was my first friend. He might have at one point been my best friend. Honestly I have very vague memories of our friendship. Not to say I didn't treasure our time but I was young. We saw each other basically everyday. You can be complacent at that age even with a friend who is constant until one day he isn't.

I didn't lose him in a tragic hide and seek accident where I forgot to seek. My parents just moved. Kids, this was a time before cell phones and computers. This was an age when if you wanted to hang out with someone you took a chance and knocked on a door, crossed your fingers, and hoped that walking downstairs wasn't a waste of time. Then you'd have to trudge all the stairs and sit wistfully for the loud sounds of his return.

There is nothing that will trump that fact. It does not matter if he stops a meteor from exploding the Earth. It doesn't matter if he scores a thousand Stanley Cup championship winning goals. Patrick Kane may or may not be a rapist but he is a bad guy.

Threatening media types who are just doing their jobs reporting the news is scum of the Earth type shit. What the hell is wrong with you? How damaged are you? Patrick Kane is not your crony. If you were facing the same type of allegations he would not come to your aid. Be a fan of hockey if you want but Patrick Kane guilty or innocent has given you enough reason to despise him.

The allegation of rape is the most serious so far but he has a past of criminal behavior. Let's not forget the guilty plea to disorderly conduct when he robbed and beat up a 62 year old cab driver. According to the driver he was punched in the face and choked and was robbed of his fare when he informed Patrick Kane he was short 20 cents. At the time Kane blamed being rich and young. Rich enough to have been slapped on the wrist.

There have been many noted stories of Kane drinking pass excess and doing stupid things. I'm not judging him for that. Even us who were young and not as privileged did stupid things while inebriated. I and a group of friends almost got a DUI for driving a golf cart under the influence of alcohol. That is something young, dumb, and drunk kids do. Beating up a cab driver for doing his job? No, that is a special kind of stupid and too drunk.

As of this posting Patrick Kane is still under investigation. Unfortunately too many people involved with the case have turned it into a circus. The victim's lawyer holding a press conference outraged at a rape kit that was tampered with and left outside of the victim's mother's house. The same lawyer quitting when it became unclear where the rape kit came from and how and where it was found and the district attorney's assertions that it was never in a bag but placed in a box and locked in an evidence locker.

As a team the Blackhawks should not have allowed Kane to attend preseason activities not as a proclamation of guilt but pending the results of the investigation. He should not be greeted with a hero's welcome. His DNA wasn't found after completion of the rape kit but that does not indicate a sexual assault didn't take place. If the investigation finds he did no wrong then let him play.

Reporters like Julie DiCaro shouldn't have to fear going to work because idiots who take sports too seriously and hate women anonymously threaten her for doing her job. Patrick Kane is an athlete. He is not worthy of blind sheep with only one brain cell coming to his aid and threatening harm. Some people disgust me. It makes me sad that I share the same oxygen with you. 

Patrick Kane has said time and time again he has or will learn his lesson. Time has shown he won't. He will always be a petulant, abusive, and misogynistic little child who will never learn his lesson because he lacks the kind of leadership that will teach him anything.

Good riddance to him and his crazed fan base.

As hard as it is to admit you need someone. I need and have help. This is for my caretaker.

Of the two of my most troubling diseases MS is the worst. I wake up exhausted. It does not matter how much I sleep I feel like I've been awake for days. You are always right there. You comfort me with your words. You tell me just to relax even though there are a thousand things to get done.

I am in chronic pain. I try not to complain about it but sometimes it overwhelms me. You hold me, you massage me, and you comfort me through it all. Just looking in your eyes makes me feel better. You understand when chores and tasks take longer because I have to take frequent breaks.

I lose my temper sometimes. I don't mean to it is among the nastiest of my MS/diabetic symptoms. It is followed by guilt and the search for the right things to say to undo the cuts my words have caused. When really I am learning to give you space and revisit later if necessary. Sure, we butt heads but once the dust settles you are still there with open arms and I fall into you. I apologize you tell me you understand. It doesn't make it okay. I'm going to start seeing someone to learn how to deal with my personal issues and my mood swings.

I say, sometimes jokingly, that I'm a broken machine. You assure me I am not. It is cliche which readers know I'm not opposed to but you complete me. You heal the broken pieces when I look into your eyes. You heal me with the sight of your smile and the sound of your laugh.

If I haven't made it obvious already this ode is to my fiancée. You hold me in your arms until the sadness and badness disappears. Your love surrounds me and I'm never alone. Our love will inspire new love songs and love stories. I'm sure Nicholas Sparks is paying attention to us for inspiration for a future novel turned movie. You'll be played by Jenna Fischer and I'll be played by Michael Cera.

You help me think of ways to improve our quality of life. This is our life this is a part of the decades of our future. Our future that will be filled with more joy, love and laughs rather than tears, sadness, and what ifs. I look forward to the day we marry and my forever with you.

You introduced me to this poem and I've adopted it as ours:
<em>I'll affect you slowly
As if you were having a picnic in a dream
There will be no ants
It won't rain</em> - Richard Brautigan

I love you, Crystal, with my whole entire heart!
