First off, the name is a misnomer; the restaurant actually offers 38 local and regional beers on tap. Way to undersell yourself, Twenty Tap! With such an embarrassment of riches, it can be hard to know where to start drinking. Perhaps that's why Twenty Tap offers a beer of the day for just $3.50. (On Tuesdays, all beers are $3.50, so you've got to find your own starting point on those days.) Or, if you feel like maximizing your sampling opportunity, you can always order a flight of three beers instead.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br />On my recent lunch visit, the daily beer special was New Holland Mad Hatter (a Michigan brewery). An IPA didn't sound appealing to me on that day, though, so I chose a Belgium blonde from Indy's own Bier Brewery instead, which hit the spot.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br />So, Twenty Tap's selection of beer is good! But how's the food?</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br />Well, it's good, too! The menu isn't particularly flashy (consisting of pub favorites such as burgers, sandwiches, salads, and so on), but what they do, they do well. For example, they offer a variety of gourmet burgers with creative names like "Wrath," "French Breakfast," and "Bonfire"—all made from locally raised Fischer Farms' beef.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o0rE6XYagI0/UV3Y8Qvl-gI/AAAAAAAAAlk/hTTbkRw9yG0/s1600/Food.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o0rE6XYagI0/UV3Y8Qvl-gI/AAAAAAAAAlk/hTTbkRw9yG0/s320/Food.JPG" width="252" /></span></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">For my meal, I decided to keep it simple and go with their "Classic" burger, which comes dressed with lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheddar cheese. For my side, I chose fries. My friend (a regular at the place) selected the pressed Cuban sandwich (ham, pulled pork, Swiss cheese, mustard, mayo, and pickles) also with a side of fries. Twenty Tap makes a variety of aiolis for dipping, so my dining partner suggested we try a couple of those as well; I chose blue cheese and she got chipotle.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br />Neither of us were disappointed with our meals. My burger was great, cooked medium and not overly salty (which I find to be a problem at many burger places). The fries were crispy and well seasoned, and the blue-cheese aioli really pushed them over the top into scrumptiousville.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br />As my friend scarfed down the last of her Cuban, she mentioned that Twenty Tap is also a surprisingly good place to take kids (she has two). She said the restaurant has a full kids' menu and provides crayons and coloring sheets to keep the little ones occupied. Plus, she added, if her kids get a little rowdy when she's there, she doesn't particularly care because she's been drinking. Now that's responsible parenting!</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1621391/restaurant/Meridian-Kessler/Twenty-Tap-Indianapolis"><img alt="Twenty Tap on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1621391/minilink.gif" style="border: none; height: 36px; padding: 0px; width: 130px;" /></a></span><br /><div style="font-size: 15px;"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2013/04/twenty-tap.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-04-04T13:00:41.680-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:92:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yL7FRL8utMg/UV3YecLSE6I/AAAAAAAAAlU/KD6HjQo1qNs/s72-c/Exterior.JPG";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-3408436156576410306";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 22:08:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Mama Irma&#039;s Peruvian Restaurant";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7411:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CaurJwczM5s/UVDJSsEXmOI/AAAAAAAAAks/x3UJJkYza58/s1600/Exterior.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CaurJwczM5s/UVDJSsEXmOI/AAAAAAAAAks/x3UJJkYza58/s320/Exterior.JPG" width="239" /></span></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I don't know why I had resisted eating at <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1625932/restaurant/Fountain-Square/Mama-Irma-Peruvian-Indianapolis" target="_blank">Mama Irma's</a>, the Fountain Square restaurant that prides itself on serving authentic Peruvian food, until last week. As someone who loves food and lives nearby, I should have been there on opening weekend a year and a half ago. I think memories of the past "Peruvian" food I'd tried held me back. I'd just never had a good experience with the cuisine. Well, that's all changed now, and I really wish I had tried Mama Irma's earlier!</span><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">As soon as my friend and I entered the small but brightly painted restaurant, we felt right at home. The owner of the place, Hilda Cano, greeted us and then showed us to our table, laughing and joking along the way. Hilda is friendly and warm, and the enthusiasm she has for her Peruvian culture and the recipes she learned from her mother (the titular Mama Irma) is infectious. I felt like I had just stepped into her house as a welcome guest.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">After scanning the menu—which includes appetizers such as potato cakes and stuffed avocados, a variety of salads, lots of seafood (including ceviches), plus quite a few steak and chicken dishes—I felt spoiled for choice. Of course, Hilda was happy to give me a few suggestions! She went into great detail on the many delicious ways the kitchen could prepare the fresh flounder, the special fish of the day. She was even open to adjusting any of the dishes to my taste.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Qfa9cK3KXyw/UVDJv0YNLfI/AAAAAAAAAk8/DJ2OnHBNwVU/s1600/Seco+de+Res.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Qfa9cK3KXyw/UVDJv0YNLfI/AAAAAAAAAk8/DJ2OnHBNwVU/s320/Seco+de+Res.jpg" width="239" /></span></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Ultimately, I ordered the <i>seco de res</i>, a cilantro-base beef stew served with white rice, beans, and onion salad (although I was intrigued by a pasta dish that was described as "chicken lo mein Peruvian style").&nbsp; To really get into the Peruvian spirit, I decided to pair it with an Inca Kola, a bright yellow drink that tasted like a lemony cream soda.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">My friend ordered the <i>ceviche mixto</i> with shrimp for his meal. Having ordered the ceviche at Mama Irma's in the past, he requested it mildly spiced; he had ordered it hot before, and it was a little too hot for his taste. He also&nbsp;ordered a glass of the homemade <i>chicha</i>, a drink made from purple corn, pineapple juice, and spices.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Let's cut to the chase: I loved every single thing I tried.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">My<i> seco de res</i> was amazing! The stewed beef was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned. I hate to write that it "melted in my mouth," but, well, it kind of did. Hilda even took the time to show me the proper way to eat the dish (you've got to get a little bit of each thing—the beef, the onions, and the beans—on the fork all at the same time for each bite). The ceviche was the best I've had in ages, fresh and citrusy as ceviche should be. It was served with hominy, yucca, potato, and some pan-roasted corn (basically homemade corn nuts). Even the <i>chicha</i>, which was a slightly off-putting shade of purple, was surprisingly tasty, sweet but not overpoweringly so. I kind of wish I had ordered it to drink instead of my Inca Kola, actually.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DEcO7tqXANc/UVDJ4pP1erI/AAAAAAAAAlE/6M9Svm_4PtY/s1600/Alfajore.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DEcO7tqXANc/UVDJ4pP1erI/AAAAAAAAAlE/6M9Svm_4PtY/s320/Alfajore.jpg" width="215" /></span></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Just as I was sitting back to rub my full belly, Hilda mentioned dessert. I didn't even notice the dessert list on the menu, but as soon as she described her world-famous, made-in-house <i>alfajores</i> cookies, I was sold. She said that customers have driven from as far away as Toledo just to get them. When she brought out my cookie, I was not disappointed. It was basically a light sandwich cookie that tasted like two very delicate shortbread cookies with <i>dulce de leche</i>&nbsp;in between and dusted with powdered sugar.

You won't find pasta in heavy red sauce here; instead, the restaurant prides itself on serving innovative, contemporary fine dining.<br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;">Bluebeard has three distinct seating areas: an outdoor patio (which, fortunately, is on the shady side of the building), a front dining room, and a back bar. The building also houses a commercial bakery called Amelia's, so all the bread is freshly baked. You can even buy Amelia’s bread at the counter in Bluebeard's front room to take home.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJSOx8_oSvA/UAnbDHz3J2I/AAAAAAAAAjs/FJCxptil8iQ/s1600/6Table.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJSOx8_oSvA/UAnbDHz3J2I/AAAAAAAAAjs/FJCxptil8iQ/s320/6Table.jpg" width="239" /></a></div>My friends and I chose to sit in the bar, which features huge, industrial-style windows, exposed I-beams, and handmade wood tables. (We sat at a table designed for five made from the fork of tree.) Book shelves line the walls, nestling machinery, typewriters, and classic novels. The bar itself (which serves 10 kinds of draft beers, about half of which come from local breweries) is furnished with mismatched, vintage stools.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;">The food is served family-style in the center of the table, so our server advised us to order a snack or two, a charcuterie plate, a cheese plate, a couple of salads, and a few mains (which come in small, medium, and large). I liked this set-up because it allowed me to try a wide variety of dishes.&nbsp;As snacks, for example, we ordered some house bread (accompanied by whipped lardo, anchovy butter, and roasted garlic oil) and radishes covered with butter and sea salt. The bread was good, especially with the bacon-y lardo on top. The radishes were fine, but they were just as advertised; it’s hard to get too excited about buttered radishes.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2zRiXDPzUo/UAnbsuMqBFI/AAAAAAAAAj8/UuPuu6xMU9o/s1600/8CheesePlate.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2zRiXDPzUo/UAnbsuMqBFI/AAAAAAAAAj8/UuPuu6xMU9o/s320/8CheesePlate.jpg" width="239" /></a></div>For the cheese course (which also came with some bread, an assortment of preserves, and pickled watermelon) we chose the truffled quark, marinated mozzarella, and fleur de terre. The fleur de terre was my favorite then the marinated mozzarella. I was not a huge fan of the quark, which was just too soft for me. We all enjoyed the cheese plate, although it definitely could have used more bread to go with it; we ended up eating quite a bit of cheese on its own.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;">Next came the salads. We tried the&nbsp;tomato and peach panzanella (with mozzarella, basil, balsamic and herb oil) and the&nbsp;greek beet salad (with green beans, cucumbers, lettuce, feta, and tzatziki).&nbsp;Both were delicious, fresh and refreshing. I preferred the tomato and peach one, which I could have ordered just for myself as eaten as my meal.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aFAu5HH5jhM/UAnbVe8vXvI/AAAAAAAAAj0/HR779z5FatU/s1600/11MarrowBones.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aFAu5HH5jhM/UAnbVe8vXvI/AAAAAAAAAj0/HR779z5FatU/s320/11MarrowBones.jpg" width="239" /></a></div>We only ordered one small dish—the&nbsp;beef tongue and cheese&nbsp;pappardelle. I liked this one a lot! The beef was super-tender and the sauce was yummy. We got two medium dishes, the white pizza (with braised lamb, kale, oregano, roasted garlic, goat cheese, and arugula) and the&nbsp;roasted bone marrow (with grated tomato, radishes, arugula, capers, and parmesan).&nbsp;The pizza was nice, although I don't think I'd get it again because it just wasn't that exciting. I mean, it was a pizza. The bone marrow looked rather unappetizing, but tasted good. As expected, it came still inside the bones. After you&nbsp;shoved it out of the bone, it looked sort of like meat Jell-O and tasted like the fattiest part of a ribeye steak. (That's a good thing, by the way.) As our large dish, we tried the&nbsp;grilled filet of snapper with ratatouille and fennel tapenade. I'm not a big fish guy, but the snapper was tasty.&nbsp;None of the desserts really appealed to us (plus, we were full), although I was intrigued by the sweet corn ice cream.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;">Eating at Bluebeard is definitely an experience, not a quick meal. Come expecting to stay for two to three hours. We went on a Monday, and it got surprisingly busy around 7:00. Our&nbsp;server seemed a little overworked as the evening wore on, forgetting some of our items and promising to bring the drink menu but then never returning. It's a new place, though, still finding its feet, so those kinds of slip-ups are to be expected.<br /><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;">As for the price, it was fairly reasonable for a fine-dining place. The total bill for 5 of us to eat dinner was around $200.&nbsp;Looking back over my thoughts, it doesn't sound like I loved the place. I suppose that's true, but I definitely did enjoy my dinner. The menu is interesting and I intend to go back, so that says something.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1686794/restaurant/Downtown/Bluebeard-Indianapolis"><img alt="Bluebeard on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1686794/minilink.gif" style="border: none; height: 36px; padding: 0px; width: 130px;" /></a><o:p></o:p></div><br />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2012/07/bluebeard.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2012-07-20T15:57:35.515-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:99:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ohG-sYgkVHk/UAnanSJG7kI/AAAAAAAAAjk/lj1-D6jgCbM/s72-c/1OutsideSeating.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-267638822251623628";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 03:04:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"The Rathskeller";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4682:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NyjKHfTPQuI/Tulj8f1TXZI/AAAAAAAAAf8/dl-FLcsFldQ/s1600/Rathskeller%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NyjKHfTPQuI/Tulj8f1TXZI/AAAAAAAAAf8/dl-FLcsFldQ/s320/Rathskeller%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5686185895520329106" /></a><a href="http://www.rathskeller.com">The Rathskeller</a>, located on Michigan St. just off Massachusetts Avenue, is a downtown Indianapolis landmark. The restaurant, housed in the historic Athenaeum Building (which was originally called Das Deutsche Haus and partially designed by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.’s grandfather), has been serving up German food since around 1894. Frankly, the restaurant’s lucky it’s got tradition on its side; the atmosphere and sense of history here are truly amazing, but the food is rather lackluster.<br /><br />My most recent visit was at lunch. After being seated by our friendly and good-natured server, I sat back to study the menu, which is fairly similar to the more expansive dinner one. Whether lunch or dinner you’ll find many of the standard German dishes such as sauerbraten, German potato salad, schnitzel, potato pancakes, bratwurst, and so on. For those who don’t like German food, there are also a surprising number of other options such as chicken salad sandwiches, tuna melts, pork tenderloins (a Hoosier tradition), French bread pizzas, and pasta dishes as well as an assortment of soups and salads. At lunch, they bring you a complimentary pretzel with a side of really spicy mustard. This was delicious—and my friends and I had fun daring each other to eat large amounts of the mustard.<br /><br />Before we ordered food, I decided to give their beer a try. Being a German restaurant and a bar, naturally they have an impressive selection of beers from all over the world. The list really is staggering! Because I couldn’t decide on just one, I ordered draught samples of the restaurant’s “Original Six” varieties: Rathskeller Amber, Spaten Lager, Spaten Optimator, Warsteiner Pilsner, Warsteiner Isenbeck, and Weihenstephaner Hefe Weisse.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uYpCS47nZN8/TulkHL9yzNI/AAAAAAAAAgI/0r8MtAMkjcM/s1600/Rathskeller%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 236px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uYpCS47nZN8/TulkHL9yzNI/AAAAAAAAAgI/0r8MtAMkjcM/s320/Rathskeller%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5686186079165795538" /></a>As for the food, the four of us decided we’d all order something different so we could try a bit of everything. The four dishes we ordered were kassler ripchen (a pork chop topped with a sauce made of apples, raisins, walnuts, and herbs), rouladen (a beef rollup filled with bacon, onions, mustard, and a pickle wedge topped with brown gravy), schnitzel (a breaded pork cutlet topped with lemon slices and served with a lemon dipping sauce), and—so we could try something non-German—fish and chips. The German dishes all came with sauerkraut and German potato salad (although I substituted spätzle noodles for my sauerkraut).<br /><br />So how was it? Well, the beer was excellent! As usual, though, the food was just okay. The rouladen was everyone’s favorite because it was nice and flavorful. How could it not be? It contains a pickle, bacon, and mustard! The kassler ripchen was fine, although it was basically just a pork chop. Nothing too special. The schnitzel was shockingly bland, rather tasteless for a breaded and fried piece of pork. The spätzle noodles were tasty, though. As for the fish and chips, it was fish and chips. ’Nuff said.<br /><br />Even though I’m never blown away by the food at the Rathskeller, I find myself going back a few times a year to soak in the atmosphere and drink some good beer. If you’re in Indianapolis for a short time, the restaurant is certainly worth a visit—to see what the city was like at the turn of the 19th century and raise a pint, if nothing else. In nice weather they even have an awesome outdoor biergarten that includes two bars and a band shell that often hosts live entertainment in the summer.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/442135/restaurant/Massachusetts-Avenue/The-Rathskeller-Indianapolis"><img alt="The Rathskeller on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/442135/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/12/rathskeller.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-12-14T19:06:40.163-08:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:106:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NyjKHfTPQuI/Tulj8f1TXZI/AAAAAAAAAf8/dl-FLcsFldQ/s72-c/Rathskeller%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-6418996393389782923";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Nov 2011 01:38:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Chef Mike&#039;s Charcoal Grill";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4219:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RIhxHvq76w0/TtQ4MdHjcTI/AAAAAAAAAfk/lR4sIE2fu68/s1600/Chef%2BMike%2527s%2BInterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 232px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RIhxHvq76w0/TtQ4MdHjcTI/AAAAAAAAAfk/lR4sIE2fu68/s320/Chef%2BMike%2527s%2BInterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5680226816646934834" /></a>Both inside and outside, <a href="http://www.chefmikescharcoalgrill.com">Chef Mike’s Charcoal Grill</a> looks pretty much like your typical American pub complete with gigantic TVs showing sports, an expansive bar, lots of booths, and a smattering of tables. What sets Chef Mike’s apart from other bars, however, is the food. All the meat is fresh, never frozen, and everything is prepared on a large charcoal grill. In addition, they make all the food from scratch—even the fries and the buns.<br /><br />As you’d expect from a place with the words “charcoal grill” in its name, the menu consists mainly of burgers, steaks, chops, and seafood. There are some interesting choices, however, including a Joseph Decuis Wagyu burger, a red devil burger (with jalapeños, Havarti cheese, and hot sauce), a pizza burger, and the Big Burger (a 3-lb burger that serves 8-12 people and must be ordered 8 hours in advance). They also offer grilled pizzas and an assortment of non-burger sandwiches (including a Philly cheese steak, a Reuben, and a grilled Portobello mushroom).<br /><br />The full bar has an extensive assortment of craft beers on tap (Fat Tire and the like) including quite a few options from the Midwest and even some local brews (mainly Sun King). I ordered a New Holland Dragon’s Milk with my dinner, which I liked very much. It was thick, dark, and oak-y—and also packed quite a wallop. They also make mixed drinks, of course; I saw someone with a margarita.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XUNjcZWziD8/TtQ42E52KzI/AAAAAAAAAfw/uRyIPY8iN9w/s1600/Chef%2BMike%2527s%2BBacon%252C%2BMushroom%252C%2Band%2BSwiss%2BBurger.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XUNjcZWziD8/TtQ42E52KzI/AAAAAAAAAfw/uRyIPY8iN9w/s320/Chef%2BMike%2527s%2BBacon%252C%2BMushroom%252C%2Band%2BSwiss%2BBurger.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5680227531701496626" /></a>As an appetizer, my friend and I decided to try the firecracker shrimp cocktail. When it came out, I was surprised to see that the shrimp were grilled, which is not what I usually expect from a shrimp cocktail. Still, I have to admit that it was delicious; the grilling really added a lot of flavor to the shrimp. The cocktail sauce was fine as well, although not quite as spicy as I like it.<br />For my entrée, I opted for the bar-b-q burger with potato salad while my friend went with the bacon, mushroom, and Swiss burger with fries. We were both quite pleased. My burger was excellent, perfectly cooked medium-rare with a splash of tangy bar-b-q sauce on top. I could have used a bit more of the sauce, actually. The potato salad was good as well and seemed lighter than potato salads at many places. My bud dug his burger, too, although he said his could have used just a touch more seasoning salt. He said the fries, which seemed coated or batter-dipped or something, were really tasty.<br /><br />Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Chef Mike’s. And the staff was friendly and welcoming, too; I don’t know if they actually are one big family, but they certainly seemed like it.<br /><br />One more thing, even though Chef Mike’s is set up like a bar, they do have an area designated for families, so you can definitely bring kids. As a matter of fact, kids under 6 eat free every day.

(I’m looking at you <a href="http://www.naisacafe.com">Naisa Pan-Asian Café</a>, <a href="http://greekkitchen.dine.com">Santorini Greek Kitchen</a>, and <a href="http://www.siamsquareindy.com">Siam Square</a>.) So, when I heard that <a href="http://www.lamargaritaindy.com">La Margarita</a> Mexican restaurant was opening its second Indianapolis-area location in the Murphy Building, I started looking forward to welcoming another great restaurant to the neighborhood. I’ve never eaten at the La Margarita up north, but I’ve heard and read good things.<br /><br />Which makes me sad to report that I didn’t really care for the place. I wish I had. Maybe they’re still finding their feet at this location? (They did just open last Thursday.) I don’t know. I just know I wasn’t impressed.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6CViAM87FdE/Trsyr8hkARI/AAAAAAAAAfE/RFaDUcHfdrU/s1600/La%2BMargarita%2BInterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6CViAM87FdE/Trsyr8hkARI/AAAAAAAAAfE/RFaDUcHfdrU/s320/La%2BMargarita%2BInterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5673183886165934354" /></a>The exterior of the building isn’t yet complete (partially because of the ongoing Cultural Trail construction, I’m sure), so I’ll just talk about the inside. The decor’s not bad. The interior is spacious and open with some nice woodwork, and the well-stocked tequila bar—which comes complete with a giant, wooden agave sculpture—is neat-o. But then you come to the purple paint and the wall of gilt mirrors, which seemed a little too Pier 1 for my taste. Still, overall, the dining room is fine. Like the outside, the interior has kind of an unfinished quality, something I imagine will go away as they settle in to the new digs. <br /><br />Right out the gate, our server was quite good, friendly and attentive. He told us about the beers they had on tap (all local stuff, which is fantastic) and brought us three different kinds of salsa: a tomato-y red, a watery verde, and an oddly creamy pico de gallo. I didn’t love any of them. None of them were particularly spicy or flavorful. The brews from Fountain Square Brewing Co. made it all good, though! I had the amber and my friend had the porter. We liked both of those.<br /><br />As an appetizer, we decided to order some guacamole. The dish came out almost immediately after we ordered it, which made me think that it might not be made to order. Even the presentation of the dip left something to be desired; the guacamole was just smeared across a white plate with a ring of tortilla chips stuck in it. The guacamole was okay at best, although it was kind of stringy like baba ghanoush. (Edit: Jon, the owner of La Margarita, assures me that the guacamole is fresh made. Mea culpa. And the tomatillos are what made the dip stringy.) I’ve had worse guacamole—usually from a plastic bag—but it didn’t hold a candle to the guac you can get at <a href="http://elsoldetala.com">El Sol de Tala</a> or <a href="http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/04/tex-mex-taqueria.html">Tex-Mex Taqueria</a>.<br /><br />As for La Margarita’s menu, it features many of the old Mexican mainstays such as fajitas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, chimichangas, and so on. In an effort to try something a little different, I ordered the shrimp tequila (shrimp sautéed with jalapeños, avocados, cream, and spices in a tequila-based sauce) while my buddy went with the nopalitos (nopales in salsa verde with chunks of potato and pork carnitas).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KpwB6jip2hA/Trsy41pulfI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/NvcXObnOmWo/s1600/La%2BMargarita%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KpwB6jip2hA/Trsy41pulfI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/NvcXObnOmWo/s320/La%2BMargarita%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5673184107659433458" /></a>Thankfully, the main part of my meal (the part with the shrimp and the peppers) was pretty dang good. It had flavor and even a little bit of heat. Unfortunately, the stuff that accompanied the shrimp on my plate was not so great. The Spanish rice was bland and mushy and the potatoes left me underwhelmed. And there was another blob of that stringy guacamole!<br />My friend liked the main part of his meal, too. His was supposed to come with tortillas, which, technically, it did; it came with two. And they were flour instead of corn. Overall, he said his meal was just okay, although it was far too wet and watery for his taste. As someone who is not usually a fan of nopales (too snotty), I gave his dish a try. Like he said, it was okay; surprisingly, the texture of the nopales didn’t bother me.<br /><br />For dessert, our server told us that they could make either ice cream nachos (which don’t sound appealing to me) or fried ice cream. We declined and left the restaurant, more than half of our guacamole uneaten.<br /><br />Look, I don’t want to sound too negative here. As someone with a vested interest in the Fountain Square area, I wanted to like La Margarita. I’ll have to give it another try in a couple of months when they’ve had time to settle in. At the very least, I want to go back to try a margarita or some tequila. I have faith in the management and staff that the restaurant will get better.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1629846/restaurant/Fountain-Square/La-Margarita-Indianapolis"><img alt="La Margarita on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1629846/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/11/la-margarita-in-fountain-square.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-11-10T08:48:44.554-08:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:109:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6CViAM87FdE/Trsyr8hkARI/AAAAAAAAAfE/RFaDUcHfdrU/s72-c/La%2BMargarita%2BInterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"6";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-2085326406875832059";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Oct 2011 00:39:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Sakura Japanese Restaurant";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3499:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EOm5bz_r-8Y/TpOQg7pYK_I/AAAAAAAAAdo/YnWv3ECI6FM/s1600/Sakura%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EOm5bz_r-8Y/TpOQg7pYK_I/AAAAAAAAAdo/YnWv3ECI6FM/s320/Sakura%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5662028051976301554" /></a><a href="http://indysakura.com/">Sakura Japanese Restaurant</a> has long been my favorite sushi place in the city, although it's too far north for me to get to very often. Luckily, I got there this past weekend, which made me realize how much I’d missed it.<br /><br />If you’ve never been to Sakura before, you should know one thing—it is tiny. And it gets very busy on weekends. Okay, two things, then—it is tiny and it gets very busy on the weekends. Three things: it is tiny, it gets very busy on the weekends, and they do take reservations. So, if you’re planning to go for dinner on a Friday night, call ahead.<br /><br />When we decided to stop in late last Friday, we had not called ahead; thankfully, there were just four or five people ahead of us, so we only had to stand around for 15-20 minutes for a table. Not bad. When we finally did take our seats, the server brought us some warm, moist towels to wipe our hands—a ritual I always find relaxing.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X8DG1406nNU/TpOQpWJ5I7I/AAAAAAAAAd0/XCkRsKZvuXI/s1600/Sakura%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X8DG1406nNU/TpOQpWJ5I7I/AAAAAAAAAd0/XCkRsKZvuXI/s320/Sakura%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5662028196530955186" /></a>Sakura has a full menu (including a lunch section) featuring Japanese dishes such as kabayaki (broiled eel in a special sauce), yakiniku (thinly sliced beef and onions sautéed in soy sauce), and chicken teriyaki on top of their fairly extensive list of sushi rolls and nigiri. For this meal, my friend and I decided to start with an appetizer of spinach gomaae (boiled spinach topped with a sesame dressing). What a great way to start your meal, light and flavorful! Of course, I love spinach and sesame seeds, so I’m an easy mark here. We also each had a bowl of miso soup, which was umami-licious. After we finished our appetizer and our soup, we decided to order sushi, opting for two soft shell crab rolls, one shrimp tempura roll, a Hoosier roll (tuna, avocado, and spicy sauce), and a New York roll (crab and avocado). Yeah, we ordered a couple of rolls too many. But that’s okay because the food was so good that I asked our server to pack the leftovers in a to-go box, took them home, and then had them as a midnight snack! Sakura twice in one day. What could be better?<br /><br />One final note, the servers here can sometimes seem a little... severe to me. They’re not rude or anything, just not particularly friendly. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, I don’t know. In any case, I never take their occasional brusqueness personally.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/442255/restaurant/Northeast/Sakura-Japanese-Indianapolis"><img alt="Sakura Japanese on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/442255/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/10/sakura-japanese-restaurant.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-10-10T17:42:14.465-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:101:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EOm5bz_r-8Y/TpOQg7pYK_I/AAAAAAAAAdo/YnWv3ECI6FM/s72-c/Sakura%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-2823754261402856605";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Oct 2011 23:28:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4924:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFAv1RGFtI/TopFUPegMWI/AAAAAAAAAdQ/9yslBAYgNZs/s1600/Saigon%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFAv1RGFtI/TopFUPegMWI/AAAAAAAAAdQ/9yslBAYgNZs/s320/Saigon%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5659412095798620514" /></a>I first ate at <a href="http://www.saigonrestaurant-indy.com/">Saigon</a> Vietnamese restaurant a year or two back when it was located in a run-down little strip mall on Lafayette Road. I remember liking the food, but being a little turned off by the atmosphere. Having heard that the restaurant recently moved to a bigger, better building on West 38th Street, I decided to give it another shot last week for my birthday. As an added present, I got to expose my parents and my brother to Vietnamese cuisine—something none of them had ever tried.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mlTg2b1UAHM/TopFrIZyUEI/AAAAAAAAAdY/3G1NqKJku_Y/s1600/Saigon%2BInterior.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mlTg2b1UAHM/TopFrIZyUEI/AAAAAAAAAdY/3G1NqKJku_Y/s320/Saigon%2BInterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5659412489036779586" /></a>When we pulled into the lot, all four of us were immediately impressed by the new, freestanding building (which used to be a Bob Evans). The exterior is clean with plenty of parking. When we stepped inside, we were even happier; the interior is bright and airy and modern—pretty much the opposite of the interior of the old location. You can choose to sit at tables, booths, or at a bar in the front of the dining room. Of course we requested a booth. Who doesn’t love a booth?<br /><br />The menu is extensive, 11 pages (not including the cover) with a 1-page lunch menu that features a selection of dishes for just $5.95. Always the bargain shopper, my mom opted for the Pad Thai Chicken lunch special. Lunches come with soup and an egg roll, too, making them even greater deals. Because she doesn’t like soup, she asked for two crispy (deep-fried) egg rolls instead, and the friendly server was happy to accommodate. She liked her Pad Thai, although it was a little too spicy for her. She said she prefers Sawasdee's Pad Thai. I can’t argue with that.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-48LTGW2T7uI/TopF6og79kI/AAAAAAAAAdg/sjHqaG9HmEk/s1600/Bun%2BThit%2BNuong%2BCha%2BGio.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-48LTGW2T7uI/TopF6og79kI/AAAAAAAAAdg/sjHqaG9HmEk/s320/Bun%2BThit%2BNuong%2BCha%2BGio.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5659412755354744386" /></a>The men of the family were not very original; all three of us ordered #91, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (grilled pork with crispy egg roll and vermicelli noodles). I recommended it, so I guess I’m to blame. Or to thank, as the case may be, because it was delicious. My dad and I devoured ours. My brother ate most of his. He said he liked it, but that he wouldn't be rushing back. Hey, it’s his first experience with Vietnamese food! <br /><br />I was actually so pleased with the place that I went back later that week with a friend of mine to try the Thai Style Curry Beef lunch special. For my two lunch sides I chose a soft spring roll (often called a summer roll) and the crabmeat asparagus soup. The summer roll was great, fresh and light and served with a little peanut sauce. I liked the soup as well; it was basically egg drop soup with added seafood. The curry was pretty dang tasty as well. I am always a little leery about ordering Thai-style food at restaurants that don’t specialize in Thai cuisine, but I was happy with my lunch. The curry was flavorful with a nice heat to it that left my mouth burning (in a good way). My second visit featured the same great service as the first, so that wasn’t a fluke.<br /><br />Note: They also serve bubble tea here, which is one of my favorite things. Unfortunately, all of their bubble teas here are icy/blended (instead of liquid). I had to try one, of course. It tasted fine (I had coconut), but the balls of tapioca were a little too big for the straw, which was frustrating. I ended up eating them with a spoon. I think I’ll hold out for some bubble tea at Taiwan Tea House.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/442252/restaurant/West/Saigon-Restaurant-Indianapolis"><img alt="Saigon Restaurant on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/442252/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/10/saigon-vietnamese-restaurant.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-10-03T16:32:54.268-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:101:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFAv1RGFtI/TopFUPegMWI/AAAAAAAAAdQ/9yslBAYgNZs/s72-c/Saigon%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-4098452319334336149";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 25 Sep 2011 15:21:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"How to Eat Fried (and Baked) Squirrels";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4446:"I grew up in rural Indiana with a father and a brother who were (and still are) hunting freaks. On any given day, you could find my family eating whatever type of wild game was in season and/or available—deer, turkey, frog, quail, rabbit, dove, pheasant, and even the occasional turtle. And, yes, that list also included squirrel. Hey, this blog is called ALL Your Food Are Belong To Us! That’s not hyperbole, people.<br /><br />Now, I haven’t eaten squirrel for several years, but my dad called me a few of weeks back to let me know that he had a couple of fresh little fellas all skinned, cleaned, and ready to cook. So, I hightailed it up to my parents’ house to see how the cooking was done—and then share the process with all of you.<br /><br />First, you need to quarter your squirrels. (Dad says that one squirrel per person is a proper serving.) You should also soak the quartered squirrels in milk for at least 30 minutes. Soaking them overnight is even better. Supposedly, this reduces the gaminess of the meat by removing some of the blood. Here is what the cleaned and soaked squirrel pieces look like.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jbk4N28gXO0/Tn9HQqW6BTI/AAAAAAAAAco/U0OkOrmNF5M/s1600/Squirrel1.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jbk4N28gXO0/Tn9HQqW6BTI/AAAAAAAAAco/U0OkOrmNF5M/s320/Squirrel1.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656318008574477618" /></a><br />Next, coat the pieces in seasoned flour. We added some salt, pepper, and a dash of Cajun spices to our flour. Dad even has a nifty little flour-coating device, which you can see below.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OwAe_ZhXHWk/Tn9HiOhA76I/AAAAAAAAAcw/vgG7HGwgNUA/s1600/Squirrel2.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OwAe_ZhXHWk/Tn9HiOhA76I/AAAAAAAAAcw/vgG7HGwgNUA/s320/Squirrel2.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656318310338326434" /></a><br />Now it’s time to brown the little suckers to seal in the flavor. Heat a half-inch of oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. Brown the squirrel in the hot oil, 5 minutes per side.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cD3StQAXWak/Tn9HzDc-_OI/AAAAAAAAAc4/hNLKJrQyHrM/s1600/Squirrel3.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cD3StQAXWak/Tn9HzDc-_OI/AAAAAAAAAc4/hNLKJrQyHrM/s320/Squirrel3.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656318599426407650" /></a><br />Remove the pieces and drain them on a paper towel.

This particular dive has a couple of things going for it—namely a quirky sense of history and a delicious double cheeseburger.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UssynM1okJI/Tn4XnizoKwI/AAAAAAAAAcY/gjBAFh1-ojc/s1600/Workingman%2527s%2BFriend%2BInterior.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UssynM1okJI/Tn4XnizoKwI/AAAAAAAAAcY/gjBAFh1-ojc/s320/Workingman%2527s%2BFriend%2BInterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5655984150149606146" /></a>The first thing you’ll probably notice as you approach the restaurant is the tempting smell of grease. The aroma of frying burgers lured me in, forcing me to ignore the rather depressing, cinderblock exterior. Inside, the place didn’t look much better. It’s basically a rectangular box with wood paneling halfway up the walls and a bar along one side. The 1950s-style tables and chairs have seen better days, too; ours even featured dirty, wadded-up napkins under two of its four legs. Still there are some charms, if you look closely. There is a couple of old cigarette machines dotted around the place and a cool antique cash register, which they still use.<br /><br />Even though it is a bar, they only have Bud and Bud Light on tap. That kind of disappointed me, but then I saw that they serve their beer in huge glass goblets, which made everything okay again. Soft drinks are in cans, too, not from a fountain.<br /><br />We were not given a menu by our waitress, so I glanced around and noticed a small menu painted on a nearby window that consisted of just four items: giant double cheeseburgers, breaded tenderloins, Mexican-style chili, and onion rings. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings while my friend opted for the tenderloin and onion rings. Later I noticed the full menu above the bar, which includes items like Braunschweiger sandwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches, and smoked sausage. Although I was intrigued by some of the items (such as the Balkan salad), I probably would have stuck with what I ordered anyway.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xkqOZFfEMfo/Tn4X1i49ozI/AAAAAAAAAcg/Ayn42o9uko0/s1600/Workingman%2527s%2BFriend%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xkqOZFfEMfo/Tn4X1i49ozI/AAAAAAAAAcg/Ayn42o9uko0/s320/Workingman%2527s%2BFriend%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5655984390690153266" /></a>Our food came out quickly, which was nice. I was definitely the winner. The burger was awesome! The patties themselves were mashed thin and fried on a griddle until crispy (kind of like the burgers at Steak ‘N Shake, only better). Eating the sandwich, I felt like I was scraping the delicious, almost-burned bits of goody from the bottom of a pan and popping them into my mouth. The double cheeseburger came fully loaded, oozing with cheese and featuring an extra bun in between the two patties (like a Big Mac).<br /><br />Compared to the burger, everything else was just okay. The onion rings were fine, but nothing special. I would have rather had fries. The tenderloin was a little disappointing, looking more like a Pete's Pride Pork Fritter than a real, hand-pounded/breaded Indiana tenderloin. Where’s the Hoosier pride?<br /><br />A couple of warnings. First, the restaurant allows smoking, which can easily ruin any meal. Second, you must pay your bill with cash, so make sure you stop at an ATM before you arrive. That antique cash register doesn’t take plastic!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/442743/restaurant/West/Working-Mans-Friend-Indianapolis"><img alt="Working Man's Friend on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/442743/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/09/workingmans-friend.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-09-24T10:48:25.300-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:120:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dAnx8c02kas/Tn4XVPEpVaI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/dDVeJX3i2Lw/s72-c/Workingman%2527s%2BFriend%2BExterior.JPG";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-8523720413188715199";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 29 Aug 2011 00:21:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"L.S.

The tea room closed up shop when Macy’s bought Ayres, but folks nostalgic for the restaurant can still visit a full-service recreation of the restaurant inside the Indiana State Museum.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7XpgWZNEcpk/TlrdYT68HbI/AAAAAAAAAb4/rY5X_PYzo44/s1600/L.S.%2BAyres%2BTea%2BRoom2.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 246px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7XpgWZNEcpk/TlrdYT68HbI/AAAAAAAAAb4/rY5X_PYzo44/s320/L.S.%2BAyres%2BTea%2BRoom2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5646068492596420018" /></a>Stepping into the recreated tea room really is like traveling back in time; the dining room is decorated in an old-fashioned style with painted, wood-paneled walls, wainscoting, recessed ceilings, brass chandeliers, and (best of all) the restaurant’s original tables and chairs. They even have backlit, in-scale photos of Indy outside the windows to make you feel like you're eating in the downtown location. Despite the elegant surroundings, there doesn’t appear to be a dress code; I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and no one raised an eyebrow.<br /><br />The tea room offers two menus—the historically inspired menu and the “today's Indiana” menu. The historically inspired one includes items like baked ham loaf, chicken velvet soup, and a Hawaiian chicken salad served in a pineapple boat. Today's menu features crab stuffed portabellas, salads, and burgers. Because we were eating in a museum in a recreation of a famous locale, my friend and I both opted to order off the historically inspired menu. He decided on a bowl of their famous chicken velvet soup and the baked ham loaf while I chose a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant with a cup of the chicken velvet soup.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GUautYXwXSY/TlrcPeWdjTI/AAAAAAAAAbo/qlOf-T-H7e8/s1600/Ham%2BSalad%2BLoaf.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GUautYXwXSY/TlrcPeWdjTI/AAAAAAAAAbo/qlOf-T-H7e8/s320/Ham%2BSalad%2BLoaf.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5646067241265761586" /></a>The baked ham salad was just what it sounded like—ham salad (like you'd eat on a sandwich) formed into loaves which were baked until they resembled Spam, served over greens, and drizzled with a mustard sauce. He was pleased with it, but thought it needed more mustard sauce. He requested some on the side, and said he liked it much better with that little extra kick. This dish was definitely old school; it looked like something that would feel right at home served with tomato aspic. We both agreed that the chicken velvet soup was very good, smooth and flavorful with chunks of chicken throughout. It was fairly rich, so I’m glad I went with just a cup, although he had no problem finishing off his bowl. The soup was especially good with a bit of buttered roll dipped into it. (As an aside, the folks at the other tables all received rolls with their appetizers, but we had to ask for some. Maybe it was the shorts and t-shirt?) My chicken salad sandwich was tasty, traditional with no surprises, which is fine. The fruit that came with it was fresh and delicious, too.<br /><br />Our server (who was very good, by the way) told us about several mouth-watering desserts as well, but both of us were stuffed. Next time I’ll have to save room for the bread pudding, for sure.<br /><br />The prices at the tea room are very reasonable. I wasn’t sure what to expect in that regard, actually, but we got both our meals plus two iced teas for less than $25. <br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed my meal at the tea room. At first, I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t a traditional English-style “tea room”—someplace where you could get a pot of tea and finger sandwiches/pastries—but I got over that pretty quick. I do still have a hankering for some homemade scones served with clotted cream and strawberry jam, though. The restaurant serves High Tea on Sundays, so maybe I’ll have to give that a try some time.<br /><br />The tea room is open every day for lunch except Monday (when the museum is closed).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/441392/restaurant/Wholesale-District/L-S-Ayres-Tea-Room-Indianapolis"><img alt="L.S.

Outfitted with natty but comfortable furniture that looks swiped from an eccentric great aunt's house, the vibe is student-y and hippy-ish. Those may not be real words, but, hey, that’s the kind of unconventional language inspired by this joint. If you don’t want to sit inside and listen to Wilco on WTTS, there is also an outdoor deck.
<br />
<br />The menu at Lazy Daze is fairly typical of most coffeehouses including coffee, espresso-based drinks (cappuccinos, lattes, mochas, etc.), hot chocolate, and a wide variety of loose-leaf teas (and even tea smoothies). They also serve ice cream and milkshakes, however, which sets them apart a bit.
<br />

Hey, it was hot! The drink was a tad too sweet for my taste; next time I'll order it with half the syrup—and maybe an extra shot of espresso for good measure.
<br />
<br />One of my friends who lives in Irvington said she loves the “frapps” at Lazy Daze, especially her favorite, the Milky Way Frapp.
<br />
<br />Look, this isn’t my favorite coffeehouse by a long shot, but it’s still a nice place to hang out. It is the center of the Irvington community, hosting weekly open mic nights, featuring local art, and serving as a meeting place for local ghost tours. Best of all, the hours are really good—better than most independent coffee places; they stay open until 10:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday and they’re even open Sundays until 9:00 p.m. For all those reasons, I’m sure I’ll find myself visiting Lazy Daze again in the near future.

It offers a 360-degree view of the city paired with a menu that changes with the seasons. On my recent visit, my friend and I decided to eat late (9:15) so we could give the food a try while also discovering what Indy looks like from above at night. Turns out—it looks pretty nice! And the food was surprisingly good, too.
<br />
<br />As soon as you’re seated at the Eagle’s Nest, they bring you a basket of ciabatta bread with butter. The bread is no great shakes—straight out of a bag and not even warmed. I was a little worried about how the food was going to be, given how underwhelming the bread was. Luckily, our appetizer of crab cakes (pan-seared with Peppadew pepper aioli) assuaged my fears. The crab cakes were excellent, comprised almost entirely of crabmeat.
<br />
<br />As a starter, I had lobster bisque and my friend had a romaine salad. My bisque was really good, thick and flavorful with a nice, spicy bite. Unfortunately, it was only lukewarm, which was kind of a bummer. My friend’s salad featured candied bacon, mixed tomatoes, and blue cheese with buttermilk dressing. It was just okay; it was a salad.
<br />
<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZpEw9X_T4_8/TkCKBIfKX4I/AAAAAAAAAaw/cINALbGq5jQ/s1600/Scallops%2Bwith%2BRisotto.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZpEw9X_T4_8/TkCKBIfKX4I/AAAAAAAAAaw/cINALbGq5jQ/s320/Scallops%2Bwith%2BRisotto.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5638658485530550146" /></a>For my entree, I had the seared scallops over shrimp and green pea risotto. The scallops were delicious, perfectly cooked (although I did get a little bit of grit). The risotto was really nice, too, loaded with shrimp. I ate every bite. My friend opted for the chicken cordon bleu, which was crispy on the outside, but tender on the inside. He liked it—especially the Dijon sauce that came with it.
<br />
<br />Overall, the food was actually quite a bit better than I was expecting. When you eat at a hotel restaurant (especially one with a gimmick), you can never be sure what you’re going to get. I was not disappointed with the meal—although it was a bit pricy, make no mistake. Still, the ambiance was good and you do get an overhead tour of the city, which is cool.

We even chatted with her a long time about the downfall of Broadripple and the punk band she was in, Action Barbie. I may go back again just so I can talk to her some more!
<br />
<br />Be advised that the restaurant does take its dress code seriously. You’re required to be “business casual,” which basically means no tank tops, logo tees, athletic wear, shorts, and so on.

And, thankfully, the line moves at a pretty steady pace; it only took my friend and I about 20 minutes to get from the door to the cashier. Not too bad. As I waited, I couldn’t help but notice that many of the people in line with me were over 65. And that most of them were, well, on the larger side of things. Just observations!<br /><br />Gray Brothers Cafeteria is set up like every other cafeteria in America; you grab a tray, walk along the front of a steam table, and tell the people on the other side of the sneeze guard what you’d like. They start you off with desserts, offering many different kinds of pie (banana, cherry, peanut butter, butterscotch, coconut, chocolate, and so on) and cake (German chocolate, hummingbird, strawberry, carrot, cheesecake, and more). They are probably most famous for their strawberry pie, although I can’t figure out why; it’s just some sliced strawberries in a pie shell with neon red glaze squeezed over the top. Not really gourmet.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WSdPuKFA-EY/TjdUNO-L9XI/AAAAAAAAAaY/FFcGTywHc1U/s1600/Gray%2BBros.%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WSdPuKFA-EY/TjdUNO-L9XI/AAAAAAAAAaY/FFcGTywHc1U/s320/Gray%2BBros.%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5636066045011424626" /></a>At my most recent visit, I opted for the white meat chicken tenders, mashed potatoes with white gravy, corn, yeast rolls, sweet tea, and banana cream pie for dessert. The chicken tenders really lived up their name, moist and delicious on the inside but still crisp on the outside. Of course, the thick, white gravy made them even better! The corn was fine; I'm sure it was out of a can, but it was buttery and peppery—just like grandma used to warm up. The mashed potatoes tasted like homemade, but I suspect that they were a combination of real mashed potatoes bulked up with instant. The banana cream pie was fine, but the bananas were all on the bottom and then covered with banana-flavored pudding. It would have been better if the pudding and the bananas had been combined.<br /><br />My friend had the chicken fried steak with white gravy, dressing, deviled eggs, unsweetened iced tea, and sugar cream pie. The deviled eggs were good, mustard-y and vinegar-y, but the steak was just okay. It had been soaking in the white gravy for some time, so it’s breading was soggy. The sugar cream pie, on the other hand, was delicious.<br /><br />The service at Gray Brothers was all around nice and friendly; they even have people in the dining room who bring drink refills. The decor is homey, old-fashioned, and clean. They restaurant also has a separate carryout door/line if you want your food to go, which is nice.<br /><br />So, yes, I enjoyed my meal at Gray Brothers. Really my only problem with cafeterias like this is that they tend to make me over eat because the portions are way too large. For example, they give you two whole yeast rolls for an order, which is one too many. Plus the food isn’t exactly healthy to begin with. Hmmm. Come to think of it, maybe those two points explain all the large people in line!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/441042/restaurant/Indianapolis/Gray-Brothers-Cafeteria-Mooresville"><img alt="Gray Brothers Cafeteria on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/441042/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/08/gray-brothers-cafeteria.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-08-01T18:35:55.778-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:107:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sqNjq2Qd5Jc/TjdTzpSGp0I/AAAAAAAAAaI/Ri-_Wog9UnQ/s72-c/Gray%2BBros.%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-7586331626570701136";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 Aug 2011 00:57:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Southern Bred in Nashville";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5564:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I-YovoABuxk/TjX6Tu3QqTI/AAAAAAAAAZw/OoqiAg-dMfs/s1600/Southern%2BBred%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I-YovoABuxk/TjX6Tu3QqTI/AAAAAAAAAZw/OoqiAg-dMfs/s320/Southern%2BBred%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635685725628311858" /></a>While visiting my sister, brother-in-law, and niece in Nashville recently, my family and I decided to go out for Saturday brunch. After consulting the Internet, we opted for <a href="http://southernbred.squarespace.com">Southern Bred</a>, which had a number of good reviews online, a menu that sounded interesting, and a nicely designed website.<br /><br />As we pulled up to the restaurant, I was a little surprised by how unassuming the place was; it’s housed in a nondescript building that looks like the offspring of a Denny’s and a suburban home. The inside wasn’t much more inspired, reminding me of the cafeteria at a fairly nice old folks’ home (except for the fun stenciled chickens on the walls).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Se97aUwrUg/TjX6dZ3z5fI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/7bdXRStP9-4/s1600/Southern%2BBred%2BInterior.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--Se97aUwrUg/TjX6dZ3z5fI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/7bdXRStP9-4/s320/Southern%2BBred%2BInterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635685891792168434" /></a>When we arrived, the place was only about half full, so we assumed that we wouldn’t have much of a wait. We were wrong. The hostess seemed to enjoy ignoring us, not even taking our party’s name for 5 minutes or so. She also seemed thrown by the fact that there were six of us (five adults and a baby), saying that they really only had tables and booths for four. We suggested that we could push together a couple of the smaller (empty) tables, but she said that was out of the question. After 20 minutes, a large crowd that included several parties with more than six people had joined us for the wait. (As an aside, there’s really no waiting area to speak of; patrons are just expected to loiter near the door, spilling out into the middle of the dining room itself.) At that point, the hostess caved in and started putting together tables to accommodate the guests.<br /><br />Finally seated, we were hungry and ready to order. Thankfully, our friendly waitress brought us a basket with a variety of fresh baked breads—buttermilk biscuits, yeast rolls, and sweet cornbread muffins—all of which were pretty good. I also ordered a glass of sweet tea, which was served in a Mason jar and was, indeed, sweet. As an appetizer, we decided to share the fried green tomatoes. They came with a Louisiana ranch sauce; even with the sauce, the tomatoes were surprisingly bland.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U4wY25RqtQk/TjX6yJP66dI/AAAAAAAAAaA/GCYH78f024Y/s1600/Southern%2BBred%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U4wY25RqtQk/TjX6yJP66dI/AAAAAAAAAaA/GCYH78f024Y/s320/Southern%2BBred%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635686248107141586" /></a>So far, none of us were impressed by Southern Bred, but we were still holding out hope for our entrees. And, although I can’t say that the dining experience was totally redeemed by the food, most of us were satisfied. My brother-in-law had the fried chicken with mac & cheese. He tends to be a picky eater, and he scarfed it all down. My dad’s fried pork chop was delicious with a light breading that didn't overpower the flavor of the juicy meat. He was also impressed with his side salad, which was huge and included almonds, bacon, homemade croutons, and a house French dressing. By far the best thing that any of us ordered was the chicken & dumplings. My sister ordered that dish and she was reluctant to share. After trying it, I could see why; the dumplings really were excellent, nice and doughy. I had the country-fried steak with mashed potatoes. They were fine, but nothing special.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my mom didn’t have even a “fine” meal. She ordered the cod sandwich with coleslaw and honey mashed sweet potatoes. The fish arrived raw in the middle, so she didn’t eat much of it. She also didn’t care for the coleslaw. So, she contented herself with the sweet potatoes and having a few bites of the rest of our meals.<br /><br />As for the kids’ menu, my sister and brother-in-law were quite pleased with it; for just $4, the little ones can get two sliders, a side dish, and a drink. My niece had the fried okra as her side, which was a little mushy but surprisingly spicy. I liked it.<br /><br />Bottom line: long wait (for no good reason) + disorganized staff + unmemorable food + mediocre ambiance = no return visit. I’m sure Nashville has better breakfast places than this—and I look forward to uncovering one of them on my next visit.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/47/1438510/restaurant/Dalewood/Southern-Bred-Nashville"><img alt="Southern Bred on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1438510/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/07/southern-bred-in-nashville.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-07-31T18:01:56.257-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:110:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I-YovoABuxk/TjX6Tu3QqTI/AAAAAAAAAZw/OoqiAg-dMfs/s72-c/Southern%2BBred%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-203485156975748989";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 24 Jul 2011 20:42:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Nick’s Chili Parlor";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3996:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zB6t1qcrkWs/TiyD1kjtanI/AAAAAAAAAZg/mKaqKK2GAss/s1600/Nick%2527s%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 229px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zB6t1qcrkWs/TiyD1kjtanI/AAAAAAAAAZg/mKaqKK2GAss/s320/Nick%2527s%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633022190303406706" /></a>I’ve been meaning to try <a href="http://www.nickschiliparlor.com">Nick’s Chili Parlor</a>—an Indianapolis fixture located on Lafayette Road—for quite some time. Because the restaurant was recently renovated and expanded, I figured this was the perfect opportunity! From the outside, the place looks like an updated Wendy’s or Rax—a typical, functional fast food restaurant. The new interior is clean, bright, and airy; I don’t know what it looked like before, but now it has the feel of a vintage diner with lots of tile, 1950s-style, metal-edged tables, and red, vinyl booths. I liked it.<br /><br />The dining room is set up like a cafeteria with desserts first. I never understand why cafeterias start with sweets, but, there you have it. Nick’s offers a variety of pies—apple, pecan, lemon meringue, and sweet potato—as well as some cookies and cakes.<br />After you work your way past the desserts, you get to the hot food. As the name suggests, the menu is heavy on chili (5-way, chili dogs, chiliburgers, etc.), but they also offer a 1/2-lb. breaded pork tenderloin sandwich, a chicken breast sandwich, a fish sandwich, and Polish sausage. Sides include “natural trim” fries, onion rings, salads, and coleslaw.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XG28-V8zX38/TiyD7Zcj6SI/AAAAAAAAAZo/2XQ9es53j-g/s1600/Nick%2527s%2BFood2.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XG28-V8zX38/TiyD7Zcj6SI/AAAAAAAAAZo/2XQ9es53j-g/s320/Nick%2527s%2BFood2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633022290399848738" /></a>I had talked a friend of mine into going to Nick’s with me by telling him about the tenderloin (because he’s not a big chili fan). Unfortunately for us, the fryers were not working the day we went, so he couldn’t get the sandwich he wanted or even French fries. Disappointed, he ordered a bowl of chili with spaghetti and beans. I happily asked for a foot-long chili cheese dog with onions.<br /><br />The chili was good, hearty and fairly traditional. This was not Cincinnati-style chili (like they serve at Skyline or Gold Star), so don’t expect that cinnamon-y kick. The chili was tasty, but it wasn't very spicy. Usually the lack of heat would bother me, but given that I ate here on a day when the mercury was pushing 100, I was fine with it. They also put lots of shredded cheddar cheese on my foot-long dog, which was fantastic. My friend was a little let down by the spice-level, so he asked for some red chili peppers to add to his soup. All they had were banana peppers, though, which cost 39 cents extra. He passed. Still, at under $6 apiece, we both agreed that the meal was pretty dang filling as well as economical.<br /><br />The staff at Nick’s was pleasant, but not particularly friendly. I think they were a little out of sorts because of the fryer situation, though, so I’ll cut them some slack.<br /><br />Nick’s Chili Parlor is open Monday through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. I plan to go back soon. I’d love to try the tenderloin—if I can pull myself away from the chili. And if the fryers are up and running!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/441745/restaurant/West/Nicks-Chili-Parlor-Indianapolis"><img alt="Nick's Chili Parlor on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/441745/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/07/nicks-chili-parlor.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-07-24T13:46:24.717-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:105:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zB6t1qcrkWs/TiyD1kjtanI/AAAAAAAAAZg/mKaqKK2GAss/s72-c/Nick%2527s%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-840584645363027715";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 01:39:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Thai Spice";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4092:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lWaM7P2pBUQ/TiTgoD1Q5wI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/2tgyuOkFi2o/s1600/Thai%2BSpice%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lWaM7P2pBUQ/TiTgoD1Q5wI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/2tgyuOkFi2o/s320/Thai%2BSpice%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5630872412948064002" /></a>When <a href="http://www.thaispiceindy.com">Thai Spice</a> first opened in a shopping plaza across from the Greenwood Park Mall several years back, its delicious food gave me a reason to drive to the south side of Indianapolis on an almost-weekly basis. After some pretty good Thai places opened closer to me, though, I found myself making the drive less and less often. In fact, when I made a visit to the restaurant a week or so back, I was surprised to find that it had moved locations (just a block or two west) to a new, freestanding building. Well, I say “new,” but the waitress told me that they’d been there for nearly a year! I guess it had been a while…<br /><br />First off, I was very impressed with the new digs. The rich burgundy and mustard-colored walls and the thick, cloth napkins (sporting the restaurant's logo) add a sense of elegance while the whimsical lotus lights keep things laid back. I was seated near the full bar, which was fine by me; made it easier to order a couple of mixed drinks.<br /><br />As a starter, my friend and I decided to order the shrimp summer roll with peanut sauce. The appetizer was tasty, although the shrimp was just piled on top of the sliced roll instead of packed inside of it, which meant my shrimp kept falling off. Not the best summer roll I’ve ever had.<br /><br />For our mains, my friend ordered mee ga tee (coconut-flavored rice noodles topped with peanut sauce, onions, bean sprouts, and ground peanuts) with chicken and I ordered panang curry (a mildly spicy curry mixed with green beans and kaffir limes leaves) with beef. I was really excited for the panang curry because That Spice serves Indy’s best version of the dish. So, I was disappointed when one of the owners came out and told me that they were out of green beans. He offered to replace the beans with asparagus, but that didn’t sound very appetizing to me, so I switched my order to yellow curry (green and red peppers, onions, potatoes, and cucumber in a creamy curry sauce) with chicken instead.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fpGvnf0VPTw/TiTgucQYl0I/AAAAAAAAAZY/8pJDTtf1d84/s1600/Thai%2BSpice%2BYellow%2BCurry.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fpGvnf0VPTw/TiTgucQYl0I/AAAAAAAAAZY/8pJDTtf1d84/s320/Thai%2BSpice%2BYellow%2BCurry.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5630872522583480130" /></a>As we waited for out meals, our server brought us some fried tofu with chili sauce, peanuts, and cilantro. I had forgotten that entrees come with tofu, but I was happy to get it. The tofu was well done, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the sauce was nice, too. When our dinners arrived, we both dug in—and didn’t stop until the food was all gone. My curry was excellent! My friend’s noodle dish was a little too much for me—incredibly rich and coconut-y—but he loved it.<br /><br />Our server was very good as well, friendly and quick. She even put up with a lame joke or two from me with a smile on her face. After finishing my meal, I sat back in my chair, full, and was quite pleased with the entire experience. I definitely plan to get back to Thai Spice’s new spot soon—hopefully before another year goes by!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/442613/restaurant/Greenwood/Thai-Spice-Indianapolis"><img alt="Thai Spice on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/442613/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/07/thai-spice.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-07-18T18:41:34.564-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:107:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lWaM7P2pBUQ/TiTgoD1Q5wI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/2tgyuOkFi2o/s72-c/Thai%2BSpice%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-7897555167628556444";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 11 Jul 2011 23:26:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"El Sol de Tala";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6146:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kNM2dtftBhw/ThuHFmcULNI/AAAAAAAAAY4/RxdoeiJtvH0/s1600/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 242px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kNM2dtftBhw/ThuHFmcULNI/AAAAAAAAAY4/RxdoeiJtvH0/s320/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5628240689617972434" /></a>I’ve been a regular at <a href="http://www.elsoldetala.com">El Sol de Tala</a> for quite a few years now. I can’t claim to go all the way back to its opening in 1979, but I definitely remember my first taste of their tacos al pastor, how excited I was when they opened their (unfortunately ill-fated) second branch downtown, and how glad I was when they returned to their original spot on East Washington Street. Because I’m so familiar with the place, I’m going to review the restaurant like it’s an old friend or a family member, pointing out the things I love but also pointing out a few of its weaknesses.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13GVO1Ez6hM/ThuHSnhZ8vI/AAAAAAAAAZA/4i0YpiZOI_8/s1600/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BInterior.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13GVO1Ez6hM/ThuHSnhZ8vI/AAAAAAAAAZA/4i0YpiZOI_8/s320/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BInterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5628240913246057202" /></a>First off, the restaurant space itself is quite nice, consisting of a spacious central “courtyard” (including a large fountain centerpiece) plus additional seating on the sides and a small balcony area. You can also choose to eat in the cantina, if you prefer. Yes, there is a rather creepy stuffed donkey by the door, but just overlook that. The main dining room can get kind of loud when the place is busy, but it’s usually not too bad. If they start to seat you in the closed off area on the right side of the dining room, however, you might want to ask if you can sit elsewhere; that particular area is like one, long hallway that amplifies sound. I’ve overheard more than one awkwardly loud conversation in there—and I’m sure some folks have unwillingly eavesdropped on my business, too!<br /><br />After you’re seated, you simply must order the guacamole, which is made fresh to order and can be modified to suit your taste. I get mine double spicy for a little extra kick while my friend Mary always orders hers without onion. If you’re not an avocado fan, I also like the cheese dip, but you should ask them to throw in some chorizo for added zing. I often order a margarita to go with my guacamole, too. Their margaritas are usually quite good—and strong!—although I have gotten one or two that were just... not right. Still, one or two iffy drinks out of a hundred ain’t bad.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Asr3gQIGxwM/ThuHdqffOwI/AAAAAAAAAZI/BPWDGzEyY3M/s1600/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Asr3gQIGxwM/ThuHdqffOwI/AAAAAAAAAZI/BPWDGzEyY3M/s320/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5628241103021882114" /></a>As for mains, one of my favorite dishes is the parrillada (mixed grill), which consists of steak, chicken, chorizo, scallions, and peppers served sizzling on a plate over an open flame. It comes with tortillas (by the way—always ask for corn tortillas, never flour), rice, black or pinto beans, and a side salad. If you’re thinking that that sounds like a lot of food, you’re right. I usually talk one of my friends into splitting this one.<br /><br />I also dig their pollo en mole (grilled chicken breast simmered in a scrumptious mole sauce), their burrito, and the meal that made me fall in love with El Sol in the first place, tacos al pastor (pork al pastor served in corn tortillas with fresh cilantro, onions, and a roasted tomatillo-jalapeno salsa). On the other hand, they have terrible tamales here. Just terrible. They’re dry and crusty and tasteless. Stay away!<br /><br />As noted, most of the meals at El Sol come with rice, beans, and side salads, all of which are delicious. The salads, especially, are surprisingly tasty. These are not the shredded piles of iceberg lettuce with a dollop of sour cream on top that you get at a lot of Mexican restaurants; instead, the side salads at El Sol consist of mixed greens and Chihuahua cheese lightly dressed with a delicious house vinaigrette.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the desserts at El Sol are almost uniformly bad. I have tried their flan twice (because this seems like a place that should have good flan), but it was gritty and tasted semi-spoiled both times. Never again. One of my friends used to like the chocolate tamale with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream, but every time he’s ordered it in the past six months, they tell him that they don’t have any. I don’t know if they no longer carry the item but haven’t bothered to take it off the menu or what. Now I just skip dessert here and stop at Dairy Queen on my way home.<br /><br />Service can be hit and miss as well. Some of the servers are quite excellent, but there are a few who will leave you high-and-dry—especially when the place gets busy.<br /><br />Still, El Sol de Tala is definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Indy. The fact that I eat there are least once a month must tell you something. Stick with the guacamole, the margaritas, and one of the dishes I highlighted above and you’ll have a great meal.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/440867/restaurant/East/El-Sol-de-Tala-Mexican-Indianapolis"><img alt="El Sol de Tala Mexican on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/440867/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/07/el-sol-de-tala.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-07-11T16:31:13.728-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:115:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kNM2dtftBhw/ThuHFmcULNI/AAAAAAAAAY4/RxdoeiJtvH0/s72-c/El%2BSol%2Bde%2BTala%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-6879864890418459562";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 Jul 2011 01:13:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Szechwan Garden";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3278:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eVb1cQcxe24/ThJlVczC95I/AAAAAAAAAYA/uRwa5D4njw0/s1600/Szechwan%2BGarden%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eVb1cQcxe24/ThJlVczC95I/AAAAAAAAAYA/uRwa5D4njw0/s320/Szechwan%2BGarden%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5625670303721125778" /></a>Located at 3649 Lafayette Road, Szechwan Garden is part of Indianapolis’s “International Corridor”—the cluster of restaurants featuring food from all over the world near the 38th Street and Lafayette Road intersection. Given that you could choose to eat Indian, Vietnamese, Ethiopian, and other exotic cuisines in that area, you might wonder why you would decide on the relatively common Chinese. I can tell you why in two words—“dim” and “sum.” Szechwan Garden is one of the few places in Indy that serves dim sum, and, for my money, they serve the best.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xj9DcVZ6FPs/ThJldcVkzpI/AAAAAAAAAYI/z631zYrW6d0/s1600/Szechwan%2BGarden%2BDim%2BSum2.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xj9DcVZ6FPs/ThJldcVkzpI/AAAAAAAAAYI/z631zYrW6d0/s320/Szechwan%2BGarden%2BDim%2BSum2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5625670441036467858" /></a>If you’ve never eaten dim sum, all you need you need to know is that you order a variety of small dishes and then share them with your friends. Szechwan Garden serves all of my favorite dim sum dishes including ha gaau (shrimp dumplings), siu maai (pork dumplings), and lo mai gai (savory glutinous rice wrapped in a lotus leaf). In fact, I’d say their siu maai was the best I've ever eaten! (The lady who makes their dough and dumplings was a pastry chef in China, so she certainly knows what she’s doing.) They also offer a few items that I had not had before like Tianjin pancake (mung bean pancake), pan-fried taro cake, and scallion pancakes. Unfortunately, Szechwan Garden only serves dim sum from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays because they make everything from scratch and never freeze the dishes.<br /><br />Szechwan Garden also features a full Chinese menu, which they offer at all times. I’ve only tried a couple of items off of it, though—namely the spicy calamari and the sautéed kong xing tsai. Both were excellent, but the kong xing tsai (a green, semi-aquatic leaf vegetable sometimes called “water spinach” in the U.S.) was a revelation. The greens were delicious, sautéed with garlic and oil. Interestingly, kong xing tsai’s high growth rate has caused it to become an environmental problem in Florida and Texas, which has led the USDA to designate it as a “noxious weed.” Best noxious weed I’ve ever eaten!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1471856/restaurant/West/Szechwan-Garden-Indianapolis"><img alt="Szechwan Garden on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1471856/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/07/szechwan-garden.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-07-04T18:15:02.225-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:112:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eVb1cQcxe24/ThJlVczC95I/AAAAAAAAAYA/uRwa5D4njw0/s72-c/Szechwan%2BGarden%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-2748295363327561675";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 28 Jun 2011 01:45:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3406:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gquJK2dk9mY/TgkyZ4FX_YI/AAAAAAAAAXw/mQs3jThanwo/s1600/Abyssinia%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gquJK2dk9mY/TgkyZ4FX_YI/AAAAAAAAAXw/mQs3jThanwo/s320/Abyssinia%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5623081029881822594" /></a>I’ve been a fan of <a href="http://www.abyssinianindy.weebly.com">Abyssinia</a> Ethiopian restaurant since it opened in a strip mall on West 38th Street several years back. Since then, that area of Indianapolis has become something of an international food lover’s paradise—but I still find myself, more often than not, passing up the newer arrivals in favor of Abyssinia.<br /><br />If you’ve never eaten Ethiopian food before, prepare yourself for a cultural experience. First off, you can choose to sit at either a Western-style table or a traditional Ethiopian table made of grass blades called a messob. Why not go all the way and choose the messob? Either way, though, don’t look for utensils when you sit down; diners eat with their fingers, using thin, spongy sheets of flatbread (called injera) to scoop up the various stews.<br /><br />At my most recent visit to the restaurant, I started with an appetizer of yesega sambusa (a fried, triangular pastry stuffed with seasoned beef) and a bottle of Bedele Ethiopian beer. The pastry wasn’t that special (and, in retrospect, rather unnecessary given the amount of food you get with your meal), but I enjoyed the Bedele, a pale, golden lager with a hoppy, honey-ish taste.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iVkwl33gz7k/TgkyhObkJII/AAAAAAAAAX4/nVzXfWSgIvQ/s1600/Abyssinia%2BFood.jpeg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iVkwl33gz7k/TgkyhObkJII/AAAAAAAAAX4/nVzXfWSgIvQ/s320/Abyssinia%2BFood.jpeg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5623081156139558018" /></a>If you can't decide on one dish to order, you can go with a combo or a “Taste of Abyssinia.” We opted for the Taste of Abyssinia 2, which included cooked spinach, lamb stew, yellow beans, and three dishes made with spicy berbere sauce—chicken, beef, and lentils. I’m happy to say that everything was delicious; we didn’t leave one dollop. Be warned that the dishes made with berbere sauce can be very spicy, so make sure you have plenty of Bedele (or water, if you’re not a beer fan) within reach! Also come prepared to get your fingers dirty; they provide you with plenty of napkins, but your hands will probably smell like spices for a day or so afterward. They’ll also bring you more injera, if you need it, so don’t skimp on the bread. Oh, one other warning—be careful of bones in the chicken and lamb.<br /><br />Abyssinia is open every day except Monday. Their hours are from 11:00 to 9:00 (Tuesday-Thursday) and 11:00 to 10:00 (Friday and Saturday).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/440025/restaurant/West/Abyssinia-Ethiopian-Indianapolis"><img alt="Abyssinia Ethiopian on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/440025/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/06/abyssinia-ethiopian-restaurant.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-06-27T18:47:03.183-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:104:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gquJK2dk9mY/TgkyZ4FX_YI/AAAAAAAAAXw/mQs3jThanwo/s72-c/Abyssinia%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-1933497143859177542";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Jun 2011 02:05:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"I&#039;ve Died and Gone to Bar-B-Q Heaven";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3282:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xw8J42wmvSQ/Tf_9Jb0AbQI/AAAAAAAAAXg/N87l6kHyrI0/s1600/Bar-B-Q%2BHeaven%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xw8J42wmvSQ/Tf_9Jb0AbQI/AAAAAAAAAXg/N87l6kHyrI0/s320/Bar-B-Q%2BHeaven%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5620489198508207362" /></a><a href="http://barbqheaven.com">Bar-B-Q Heaven</a> has been serving up slow-cooked, made-on-site barbecue in the heart of Indianapolis since 1952, making it a bona fide Hoosier institution. And yet, I just ate there for the first time last week. What the hell’s wrong with me?<br /><br />The menu at Bar-B-Q Heaven includes all of the classic barbeque items like spare ribs, pork chops, chicken, and rib tips. They use hickory, apple, and cherry wood to roast their meats right inside the restaurant. Side items include macaroni and cheese, greens, baked beans and homemade chili. They also offer desserts like sweet potato pie, chess pie, and cheesecake.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-emqHUqJP9mw/Tf_9WS1aYJI/AAAAAAAAAXo/czSjc5wPdPY/s1600/Bar-B-Q%2BHeaven%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-emqHUqJP9mw/Tf_9WS1aYJI/AAAAAAAAAXo/czSjc5wPdPY/s320/Bar-B-Q%2BHeaven%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5620489419436482706" /></a>For my initial visit, I decided to try the pulled pork sandwich (which the folks here call “pork on bun”). They offer a choice of three homemade sauces—hot, mild, and sweet. Throwing caution to the wind, I decided to order the hot sauce. Usually I find “hot” sauces to be “not so hot.” But, the hot sauce at Bar-B-Q Heaven actually brought a little heat! It certainly wasn’t unbearable, but it was good and spicy. The pork itself was delicious, tender and flavorful. To counteract the heat, I also ordered a side of potato salad. It did the job of cooling down my mouth, but otherwise it was just pretty standard mustard-based potato salad. It wasn’t bad, but nothing great. I also ordered some sweet tea, which I assumed would be brewed in-house. To my dismay, I was handed a bottle of Gold Peak tea. It wasn’t undrinkable, but it was a far cry from freshly brewed.<br /><br />Be advised that this is not the kind of place where you’re going to have a seat and dine-in. For one thing, there are no tables or chairs. For another, the walk-up ordering area is pretty small, so there’s not a lot of room to dilly-dally.<br /><br />Overall, I was quite pleased with the food at Bar-B-Q Heaven. The barbecue itself was delicious and the sauce was tangy and hot. I’ll definitely be back for more before another 59 years go by! Next time I’ll probably just make my own tea at home, though.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/440134/restaurant/Northwest/Bar-B-Q-Heaven-Indianapolis"><img alt="Bar-B-Q Heaven on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/440134/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/06/ive-died-and-gone-to-bar-b-q-heaven.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-06-20T19:09:49.667-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:111:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xw8J42wmvSQ/Tf_9Jb0AbQI/AAAAAAAAAXg/N87l6kHyrI0/s72-c/Bar-B-Q%2BHeaven%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-3082153457179279931";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 Jun 2011 02:29:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"3 Days in Paris";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3931:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7LUVg4n3Tkg/TfV2GubOqpI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/HvDKDGCbex8/s1600/3%2BDays%2Bin%2BParis%2BFront.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7LUVg4n3Tkg/TfV2GubOqpI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/HvDKDGCbex8/s320/3%2BDays%2Bin%2BParis%2BFront.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5617525968128092818" /></a>The good folks behind <a href="http://www.marketfreshcrepes.com/3_Days_in_Paris/Welcome.html">3 Days in Paris</a> have been whipping up Parisian-street-style, hand-held, sweet and savory crêpes at farmers’ markets across the Indianapolis area for over a year now. Lucky for us downtowners, they finally opened their first permanent location inside the central atrium of the historic City Market this past February.<br /><br />The menu at 3 Days in Paris consists entirely of crêpes—but they offer a wide variety of the very thin pancakes. Some of the savory varieties include Green Eggs and Ham (egg, ham, mozzarella cheese, spinach, and pesto), Buffalo (chicken, buffalo sauce, bleu cheese, mozzarella, celery, and ranch dressing), and BLT (bacon, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, and jack cheese). If you have a sweet tooth, they also make crêpes stuffed with things like Nutella, bananas, apples, and so on. Or, if none of those appeal to you, you can even create your own.<br /><br />At my recent visit, my two friends and I decided to try as many different varieties as possible. To that end, one of my friends ordered the Pic Nic (chicken, BBQ sauce, bacon, jack cheese, onion, and cilantro) and the Black & Blue Moo (beef, blue cheese, mozzarella, onion, dried cranberries, spinach, and roasted raspberry chipotle sauce). Yeah, he’s a bit of a pig. My other friend got the Market St. (mushroom, onion, sundried tomatoes, red bell pepper, cheese, buffalo sauce, celery, and spinach) while I opted for the Harvest (ham, apple, dried cranberries, havarti, spinach, and roasted raspberry chipotle sauce).<br /><br />After we placed our orders, we waited. And waited. Be warned that this can take a while if you get at the end of any line whatsoever. When I was there this past week, for example, they were only running two hot plates. Given that each crêpe takes several minutes to cook, they can get backed up very quickly. I waited at least fifteen minutes for my crêpe, which is pretty slow for lunch. Still, if you're not in a rush, it’s kind of fun to watch them swirl the crêpes.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xd12XIVN6g8/TfV2MxoZ0NI/AAAAAAAAAXY/Q4mHIAwhVJw/s1600/3%2BDays%2Bin%2BParis%2BHarvest%2BCrepe.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xd12XIVN6g8/TfV2MxoZ0NI/AAAAAAAAAXY/Q4mHIAwhVJw/s320/3%2BDays%2Bin%2BParis%2BHarvest%2BCrepe.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5617526072067870930" /></a>And, thankfully, the food was worth the wait. And cheap! The crêpes cost (at the most) just $6.50 apiece. And they are extremely filling, large and stuffed with high-quality ingredients. In fact, my friend who ordered two couldn’t finish his second one. None of us had any complaints. I wasn’t totally sold on the apples in mine, but they weren’t a showstopper. Next time I’ll be ordering the Pic Nic, though. That one looked amazing.<br /><br />3 Days in Paris is open Monday through Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Thursday and Friday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1584885/restaurant/Wholesale-District/3-Days-in-Paris-Indianapolis"><img alt="3 Days in Paris on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1584885/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/06/good-folks-behind-3-days-in-paris-have.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-06-12T19:32:59.442-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:113:"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7LUVg4n3Tkg/TfV2GubOqpI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/HvDKDGCbex8/s72-c/3%2BDays%2Bin%2BParis%2BFront.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-3393660416643822764";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Jun 2011 01:08:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Saffron Café";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4657:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FCjkbH2cjUw/Te2KgndYBJI/AAAAAAAAAXA/EfLYpB8sqrQ/s1600/Safrron%2BCafe%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FCjkbH2cjUw/Te2KgndYBJI/AAAAAAAAAXA/EfLYpB8sqrQ/s320/Safrron%2BCafe%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5615296603353515154" /></a>A couple of friends and I recently decided to grab lunch at <a href="http://www.saffroncafe-indy.com">Saffron Café</a>, downtown Indianapolis’ only Moroccan restaurant. I had eaten there once before (and had some mediocre paella), but this was the first visit for my two chums. Would my second visit be better than my first? Read on to find out!<br /><br />It’s hard to miss this place from the outside; the sides and back of the building are beautifully painted in bright, bold colors that bring to mind exotic North Africa. Oddly enough, the front of the restaurant isn’t much to look at thanks to a black tent that allows outdoor seating even in inclement weather. Inside, the dining room is very classy with white tablecloths and waiters in suits. Don’t let all that opulence fool you, though, the place is a bargain—especially at lunch.<br /><br />As soon as we were seated (there was no wait), our server brought us a generous helping of bread, which I used to dip in the olive oil already on the table. Both the bread and the oil were fine, but nothing particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />My absolute favorite Moroccan treat is pastilla, a crisp honeyed phyllo dough pie stuffed with chicken and cinnamon-roasted almonds that combines sweet and salty flavors into one delicious dish. From my first visit to Saffron Café, I recalled that their version was quite good, so I tried to order one as an appetizer for the three of us to share. Unfortunately, though, they only serve pastilla at dinner. So, if you visit the restaurant for dinner, don’t pass up the opportunity to get one of these meat pies.<br /><br />But enough about the one dish they didn’t have at noon. What is on the lunch menu? Quite a bit, actually. They offer a variety of soups (harrira, bissara, carrot ginger, lentil, and so on), a few different salads, kabbabs (all served with saffron rice or roasted potatoes and vegetables), quite a few types of tajines (slow-cooked stews served in colorful, traditional Moroccan pots), as well as some pastas and sandwiches. One of my friends opted for the lunch house salad and soup special, choosing harrira (cilantro soup with tomatoes, saffron rice, and chickpeas) as his soup, while my other friend decided on the ginger chicken tajine. I chose the honey-pear chicken tajine.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PbzcRjPwmg8/Te2Kno9daYI/AAAAAAAAAXI/w52YQspFpQ8/s1600/Safrron%2BCafe%2BFood.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PbzcRjPwmg8/Te2Kno9daYI/AAAAAAAAAXI/w52YQspFpQ8/s320/Safrron%2BCafe%2BFood.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5615296724015606146" /></a>The food came out quickly, which is always nice at lunchtime. My friend who ordered soup and salad loved both. I had a bite of his soup and it was very good. My tajine was delicious, too, sweet and savory at the same time; the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and the cooked pears added a nice burst of flavor. There was a thin layer of grease floating on top of the stew, which was a little unappetizing, but probably unavoidable. Also, my potatoes were a little undercooked, but not terrible. My friend who ordered the ginger chicken tajine enjoyed her stew as well, although she was ultimately jealous of mine, digging on the pears. If you order a chicken tajine, be aware the chicken is served skin-on and bone-in. That made it a little difficult to eat, causing me to feel like I was wasting some of the meat because I couldn’t find it! The bread came in handy, though, working as a sponge to soak up the remaining juice from the tajine.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed my second visit to Saffron Café more than the first. I will definitely be back. Next time I’ll make sure I come for dinner, though, so I can get some pastilla.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1427520/restaurant/Downtown/Saffron-Cafe-Indianapolis"><img alt="Saffron Cafe on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1427520/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/06/saffron-cafe.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-06-06T19:19:36.115-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:109:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FCjkbH2cjUw/Te2KgndYBJI/AAAAAAAAAXA/EfLYpB8sqrQ/s72-c/Safrron%2BCafe%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-766782922966667184";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 May 2011 22:46:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Taking a Break at Recess";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5026:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x8ZDeDPQaWA/TeLN1APkxYI/AAAAAAAAAWk/0tBhKwfG0Ss/s1600/Recess%2BExterior.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x8ZDeDPQaWA/TeLN1APkxYI/AAAAAAAAAWk/0tBhKwfG0Ss/s320/Recess%2BExterior.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612274396139144578" /></a>If you haven’t been to <a href="http://recessindy.com/restaurant.html">Recess</a> yet, the set-up of the restaurant might need a little explaining. Basically, the place serves just one pre-set, multi-course, price-fixed meal each night. You may have a choice between two dishes for some courses, but, in general, everyone eats the same thing – whatever Chef Greg Hardesty has decided to cook up that evening. They post the dinner menu to their website each day so you can take a look, decide if what they’re serving is your cup of tea, and make reservations, if you’re interested.<br /><br />Last night, for example, my three friends and I had a choice for our first course between a spring vegetable soup topped with pecorino cheese or a mixed greens salad with shaved fennel, grape tomatoes, and blue cheese. I went with the soup while my friends all chose the salad. Based on our reactions to the dishes, I chose… poorly. (Yes, that’s a reference to <span style="font-style:italic;">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</span>. I couldn’t help myself!) They all enjoyed their salads, saying they were light and fresh and delightfully fennel-icious. My soup, on the other hand, was merely adequate. It was thin, filled with root vegetables, and kind of reminded me of Campbell’s.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTbgxszgfNU/TeLOFZjhrEI/AAAAAAAAAWs/IcUZl0HVHUs/s1600/Alaskan%2BHalibut1.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MTbgxszgfNU/TeLOFZjhrEI/AAAAAAAAAWs/IcUZl0HVHUs/s320/Alaskan%2BHalibut1.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612274677811620930" /></a>Slightly disappointed, I headed into course number two. Thankfully, there was just one option here – Alaskan halibut with cumin-roasted carrots and onions, avocado-lime puree, and fried taro root – so I couldn’t make a bad choice. Now this, this was delicious. As one of my friends commented in a faux British accent, “The flavor and texture of the halibut were spot on.” The taro root on top was salty and crunchy and the avocado purée was simply awesome. I could have eaten three more servings of this!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DfqBg6e9xag/TeLOYYQYLTI/AAAAAAAAAW0/oV1xcYYh9s8/s1600/Lamb%2BRib%2BEye.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DfqBg6e9xag/TeLOYYQYLTI/AAAAAAAAAW0/oV1xcYYh9s8/s320/Lamb%2BRib%2BEye.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612275003880385842" /></a>For our next course, we were again offered a choice of two dishes – panko-crusted black bass with mashed potatoes, wilted greens, and a roasted-garlic/tomato jus or lamb ribeye with cheddar macaroni and cheese, wilted greens, and red wine sauce. I stuck with the majority on this one and went with the fish dish. Only one of us chose the lamb. The sea bass was – like the halibut – perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside. Chef Greg certainly knows how to cook fish! I was a little dubious about serving fish atop wilted greens and mashed potatoes, but I was totally wrong. The greens were wilted, yes, but not mushy, and they tasted really good with the potatoes. The one of us who had the lamb ribeye love it, too; he said it was tender and juicy. It did look good, cooked to medium-rare, taken off the bone, and pre-sliced.<br /><br />For dessert, we were presented with a “cuatro leches” cake, which was described as a traditional tres leches cake with the addition of buttermilk for some kick. The cake was pretty good, but it was more like a pound cake, heavier and denser than any tres leches cake I’ve ever had. Also, it wasn’t as milk-soaked as I was expecting, which kind of disappointed me. It was a lackluster ending to a good meal.<br /><br />So, overall, I liked the food at Recess, but only two of the four courses really blew me away. For $56/person – not including drinks or a tip – that’s not really good enough to lure me back again anytime soon. Maybe on my next birthday – if the menu on that day appeals to me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/40/1502447/restaurant/Broad-Ripple/Recess-Indianapolis"><img alt="Recess on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1502447/minilink.gif" style="border:none;width:130px;height:36px" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2011/05/taking-break-at-recess.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"noreply@blogger.com (Corey Michael Dalton)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-09-24T11:48:14.114-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:101:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x8ZDeDPQaWA/TeLN1APkxYI/AAAAAAAAAWk/0tBhKwfG0Ss/s72-c/Recess%2BExterior.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-952244324226941600.post-3353823655421786139";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 May 2011 18:26:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"Brunchin’ It Up at Iozzo’s Garden of Italy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3849:"I already reviewed <a href="http://www.iozzos.com">Iozzo’s Garden of Italy</a>’s lunch/dinner menu in an <a href="http://allyourfoodarebelongtous.blogspot.com/2010/11/are-all-gardens-in-italy-this-tasty.html">earlier blog post</a>, but the restaurant recently introduced a Sunday brunch, giving me the perfect excuse to revisit this delicious local eatery. The new brunch menu is only available on Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and includes some items from their usual menu (such as spaghetti, chicken Marsala, and lobster ravioli) as well as special breakfast dishes (like several types of egg scrambles, a few different Benedicts, oatmeal brûlée, and strawberry ricotta pancakes).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3pxjwy_rADw/TeKQ0Ew8Z1I/AAAAAAAAAWE/xVpVrIpiT3M/s1600/Iozzo%2527s%2BCourtyard.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3pxjwy_rADw/TeKQ0Ew8Z1I/AAAAAAAAAWE/xVpVrIpiT3M/s320/Iozzo%2527s%2BCourtyard.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612207309963683666" /></a>At my recent visit, my friend and I arrived early on a warm spring day and asked to sit in the back courtyard. The staff was happy to accommodate and set us up at a shady table near the burbling fountain. If you haven’t eaten in Iozzo’s garden before, you’re really missing out; it’s a lovely oasis of calm right in the heart of downtown.  We both ordered coffees and settled in to read the paper and peruse the menu. My friend also decided to try Iozzo’s loaded Bloody Mary, which was made from Indiana vodka and Bloody Mary mix and served with a jumbo shrimp, a slice of prosciutto, a stick of celery, an olive, some cucumber, and a wedge of lime. The coffees were good and his mixed drink was excellent.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O59zdCqTi5E/TeKRDKD0R7I/AAAAAAAAAWM/T0vN6Havvmk/s1600/Iozzo%2527s%2BFrench%2BToast.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O59zdCqTi5E/TeKRDKD0R7I/AAAAAAAAAWM/T0vN6Havvmk/s320/Iozzo%2527s%2BFrench%2BToast.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612207569083058098" /></a>After taking our time with the menu (hey, it’s brunch!), we both made our decisions. My friend ordered the Caprese scramble (eggs cooked with tomato, mozzarella, and basil) while I opted for the amaretto creme brûlée French toast. Wow, that name is a mouthful! And so was the dish itself, made with cubes of bread soaked in a creamy custard and then baked. It really was delicious, almost more of a bread pudding than a traditional French toast. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, and the top pieces of bread were slightly charred, which I liked. The sausage patties that came with it were nice, too, spicy and fennel-y like an Italian sausage link. I managed to finagle a bite of the egg scramble, too, and was pleased with it. The eggs were light and fluffy, cooked with generous amounts of tomato and cheese. I wasn’t crazy about the potatoes that accompanied the eggs, though. They were cooked with onions and tomatoes, which was a good combination, but they were a little underdone for me.<br /><br />Overall, I was very happy with Iozzo’s brunch. The restaurant provides a beautiful setting, great food, and good prices.
