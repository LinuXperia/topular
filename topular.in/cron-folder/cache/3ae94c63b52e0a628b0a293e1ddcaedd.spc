<p>Urban planners have long cast the artist and gay/lesbian communities as urban pioneers and harbingers of gentrification. We’ve heard the stories of North Halsted in Chicago, the Pearl District in Portland, the South End in Boston and Soho/Chelsea in Manhattan. But, ever since hipsters became part of the sub-culture lexicon, urban experts have blamed gentrification on them. From Williamsburg, Brooklyn to the Mission in San Francisco hipster havens have continued to demonstrate that gentrification isn’t limited to the artists or gays (although I’m not sure there is much of difference). The latest installment, not to anyone’s surprise in the Boston area, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville,_Massachusetts">Somerville</a>, which was the subject of a <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/08/22/some-somerville-worry-become-too-hip-for-its-own-good/Ibas2h5Q5p9MTl82qQ2OwK/story.html">recent piece</a> by Beth Teitell in the Boston Globe.</p>
<p>Somerville’s back story is what you would expect of a turn-around tale in urban terms. Inner Ring suburb – check. Architecturally rich yet deteriorated housing stock – check. Mass transit connectivity – check. Cheap rents – check (well not anymore). Walkable, dense urban neighborhoods – check.  Enter artists, gays but more overwhelmingly, hipsters, or so portends the title of the Globe article  “Somerville worries it’s growing too hip”. Somerville is noteworthy however in a couple ways. First, it is the densest city in all of New England, almost exclusively achieved through low-rise residential housing types – think triple deckers, condos and townhomes.  Second, local government has proved not to be a hindrance, instead turning it from a crime ridden place known as “Slummerville” to among the state’s <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2006/05/14/the_model_city/">best run municipalities</a>. The schools however have a long way to go (we’ll discuss later). </p>
<p>As the story points out if gays, artists and hipsters are the first adopters, it won’t take long for the effects of gentrification to show themselves through drastic changes to the retail sector and the good ol’ barometer of choice, housing prices. Let’s take a look at both, since the retail and real estate sectors approach gentrifying neighborhoods much more systematically than do our hipster friends. </p>
<h3>Retail</h3>
<p>If you’ve visited Davis Square recently, you know that the retail landscape has changed drastically in the last decade. Walgreens and Starbucks are among your anchor tenants. The food and beverage offerings have gone from cheap working-class linoleum floor eateries to upscale bistros and kitchens and cantinas. Alfresco’s, a modest Italian restaurant got rebranded as <a href="http://imwithmeat.com/home.html">M3</a>, a “concept in southern dining” replete with catfish, chalkboard paint  tables straight from a Pinterest board and plenty of canned beer you’ve never heard of.  Likewise, the <a href="http://thepaintedburro.com/">Painted Burro</a>, which calls itself a “Mexican Kitchen and Tequila Bar”, expanded in less than a year into the space occupied by Spike’s Junkyard Dogs – a blue collar, fluorescent lit hole in the wall. It won’t be missed – and no you still can’t get a table midweek at the “burro” without a reservation. That doesn’t even begin to describe the <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/05/25/pinkberry-orange-leaf-and-more-charting-frozen-yogurt-gold-rush/vZZ5RMe2MVUV6u7g9Eo8tM/story.html">explosion of fro-yo shops</a> in Davis which saw its count jump from zero to three in the last year. Even if the new smell wears off, as Teitell’s article depicts, top local chefs are elbowing their way into Somerville to be part of the action. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in town, the loveable loser Johnny Foodmaster grocery chain has been supplanted by Stop &#038; Shop and Whole Foods. You don’t need to be from Boston to know that when Whole Foods takes over for any grocer, things they are a changing. The fact that national behemoths like Starbucks, Chipotle, Pinkberry and Whole Foods are betting on Somerville is telling of what stage of gentrification the city is now experiencing. If retail is said to follow rooftops, then clearly retailers are paying attention to who is underneath those rooftops. Somerville’s population has largely remained static while its <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/25/2562535lk.html">demographics</a> have changed considerably. It’s now home to the second largest concentration of 24-35 year olds in the country – a Neilsen analyst’s version of shooting fish in a barrel. </p>
<p><center><img border="0" src="http://www.urbanophile.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/somerville1.png"><br />
<em>Population hasn&#8217;t changed since 1980 &#8211; but WHO composes that population has.</em></center></p>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<p>It wasn’t long ago that “<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Slummerville">Slummerville</a>” was a moniker real estate agents had to overcome when selling homes in Somerville. The days of getting bargains in town have largely disappeared as developers have chopped up large three story homes into condos and townhomes that routinely sell for $500/sf or more. Hipster populations in Somerville’s Davis Square have migrated within city lines to places like Union Square, Magoun Square and East Somerville. Even with a red-hot real estate market in greater Boston, Somerville remains white hot. </p>
<p>Red Fin reports a 103% sale to list ratio with a median home price of $470,000 and an average of 28% down in the second quarter of 2013. Clearly its not 24-35 year old hipsters putting down an average of $131,000 to claim of piece of Somerville as their own. White Collar professionals and families are among the early late majority that are betting on Somerville just as much as Starbucks and Whole Foods are. The loss of affordable housing and diversity would be lamentable if it weren’t so inevitably predictable. It’s not as if riders of fixed gear bikes wearing skinny jeans have disappeared, they just have to dodge baby strollers on the sidewalks and VWs, Mini Coppers and Audis in the streets. </p>
<p><center><img border="0" src="http://www.urbanophile.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/somerville2.png" width="575"><br />
<em>Davis Square and Inman Square are no bargain any more.</em></center></p>
<h3>Schools</h3>
<p>Lastly, all the kids in strollers will need a place to attend school someday. If only Somerville were that place. SchoolDigger.com recently <a href="http://www.schooldigger.com/go/MA/districtrank.aspx">rated the city 299th out 325 school systems</a> state wide. For all the progress Mayor Joe Curtatone has made, he’s clearly focused on the early adopters and the hipness of the city, with the schools as a longer term project. It might be sensible, but he and the city are running out of time. The Wellesleys, Newtons and Miltons might lack hipsters or artists or gays but they have a leg up on schools, an advantage suburbia has always had over the urban core. Undoubtedly its schools will have to do better and they will as gentrification will lead to higher standards, be they in the retail, real estate or city services sectors.</p>
<p>Somerville finds itself (by definition a suburb, yet still a city) in an interesting position as the effects of hipness and gentrification point to seemingly distinct paths. One is like other <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/2012/09/20/americas-hippest-hipster-neighborhoods/">hipster havens</a> in Brooklyn or Wicker Park – places that have retained a shade of the counterculture tendencies that define hipster identity. Two is like mature urban inner ring suburbs, Brookline and Cambridge being two local examples. The latter can claim to be cool but lack the authenticity of Somerville’s creative culture. The former over deliver on cool and trendiness and priceyness but because they are neighborhoods within New York and Chicago (or any large city) respectively, under deliver on the city services that suburbs provide. Whatever happens, the hipsters likely won’t be a permanent part of Somerville history as it&#8217;s usually the politicians or the wealthy elite of any given place that decide its fate. For now the trendy capital of Metro Boston can pat itself on its plaid-clad back, and keep its beanie cap-covered-head high. See you at Chipotle. </p>

There&#8217;s a sort of default answer in the marketplace that I&#8217;ll call for want of a better term the &#8220;Standard Model.&#8221; The Standard Model more or less tells cities to try to be more like Portland.  That is, focus on things like local food, bicycles, public transit, the arts, New Urbanist type real estate development, upscale shopping, microbreweries, coffee shops, etc., etc. The idea seems to be that the Rust Belt city model is a failure and should be chucked in favor of something better. In this model the publicly subsidized real estate project is the preferred economic development strategy. We&#8217;ve seen city after city work to create downtown and near-downtown &#8220;Green Zones&#8221; resembling miniature Chicagos. While these have generated excitement and even attracted some residents (upwards of 4,000 in Cleveland and 3,000 in St. Louis, though these are the high end), they have not fundamentally changed the civic trajectory other than in the largest Tier One type cities. And they likely never will. People who want Standard Model urbanism can find superior versions in many cities that generally boast more robust economies to boot.</p>
<p>Enter Rust Belt Chic. This approach in theory solves two of the issues plaguing Standard Model urbanism, authenticity and uniqueness. I haven&#8217;t seen a crisp definition of what Rust Belt Chic actually is according to its boosters, but Pete Saunders <a href="http://cornersideyard.blogspot.com/2013/09/rust-belt-chic-and-cdc-model-revisited.html">summed up some of the salient points</a>.  The three key elements I see, which build upon each other:</p>
<p>1. Do the Fail. Giving up on the idea of the factories coming back or large scale re-population.</p>
<p>2. Reject Growth as a Success Marker. This actually aligns it somewhat with the standard model. Traditional signs of civic success such as population and job growth are rejected in favor of items like per capita income, brain gain, etc.</p>
<p>3. Brashly Embrace the &#8220;Rust&#8221; in Rust Belt. This extends Do the Fail to actually embrace the civic characteristics failure produced, as well as various quirky legacies of the industrial past such as <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2012/08/21/anorexic-vampires-and-the-pittsburgh-potty-the-story-of-rust-belt-chic-by-richey-piiparinen/">Pittsburgh potties</a>.</p>
<p>The best part of Rust Belt Chic is that it understands that you have to be who you are, not who you aren&#8217;t. Someone once described a brand as &#8220;a promise delivered.&#8221; When cities decide that what they are is of no worth or that it can&#8217;t succeed in the marketplace, the temptation can then be to try to pretend like they are Portland or some such. Almost invariably in such cases cities end up building towards a false promise they can never deliver. That&#8217;s not to say any of the elements of Standard Model urbanism are bad in an of themselves. The problem is that they are basically &#8220;best practices&#8221; types of things. Just as no company can succeed as nothing but an agglomeration of best practices, no city can either.</p>
<p>The tendency in Rust Belt cities has been to try to downplay their authentic characteristics in order to try to portray themselves as hip and with it. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2008/07/06/the-brand-promise-of-indianapolis/">noted before</a>, the one thing most clearly associated with Indianapolis is the Indianapolis 500, yet auto racing plays a fairly small role in how the city tries to sell itself these days.</p>
<p>Rust Belt Chic is a first attempt at a region deciding no longer to be a passive importer of ideas about what cities should be, but instead trying to chart a path that is rooted in a unique, local history, culture, geography, etc. To the extent that it steers cities away from a purely &#8220;me too&#8221; strategy towards creating something that has a unique market positioning that&#8217;s real to the place and has at least some competitive advantage in the marketplace, Rust Belt Chic is a big win.</p>
<p>However, as currently constituted, Rust Belt Chic would appear to be limited. In effect, it is really a marketing and to some extent a talent attraction program. Looking at the ironically appropriated trappings of the working man that characterize so much of hipsterdom, Rust Belt Chic says &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve got the real thing.&#8221; So rather than drinking PBR ironically, you drink I.C. Light with a more subtle degree of irony (i.e., by pretending that you&#8217;re actually drinking it authentically). The term &#8220;chic&#8221; itself is suggestive of fashion, and thus of artifice.</p>
<p>What Rust Belt Chic does not do is address any of the core problems of the cities in question, ranging from fiscal crises to corruption to poor business climates to segregation, to say nothing of safe streets, better schools, etc. Maybe that isn&#8217;t its aim. But if not, then it would appear to be only one small component of an overall civic strategy, and not an alternative to the Standard Model in its own right. The theory of change it embodies would appear to be that authenticity of place and culture will attract people looking for the real, thus restarting the demographic engine through more population dynamism and ultimately that will percolate into the economy. That&#8217;s fine as far as it goes, but it&#8217;s insufficient.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Underwood"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Carrie_Underwood_2%2C_2012.jpg/477px-Carrie_Underwood_2%2C_2012.jpg" width="250" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"></a>The elevation of authenticity also poses the danger of imprisoning the community in a straitjacket from the past. With &#8220;do the fail&#8221; and the embrace of decline as part of the culture, Rust Belt Chic deftly side steps some of the worst dangers of the corrosive force of nostalgia. However, the problem with authenticity is that is has to be, well, authentic. And the way that&#8217;s normally accomplished is by encasing something in amber, stunting its evolution.</p>
<p>What Rust Belt Chic needs to be able to do is inform real, substantive change, and to not only unearth the authentic civic character, but updates it for 21st century realities.</p>
<p>A city I think has done this quite well is Nashville. It would have been tempting for them to see their country music legacy as déclassé, and try to basically pitch themselves as the Portland of the South or some such. Instead, while they have embraced a number of Standard Model approaches &#8211; as I said, there&#8217;s nothing per se wrong with them &#8211; they kept country music as core to their identity. But it isn&#8217;t yesterday&#8217;s country music or culture. People in Nashville today aren&#8217;t sitting around watching Hee Haw reruns. Country music today is as much Hollywood as Hank Williams. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say Nashville disparages its past. Far from it. The old classic country performers are still honored, and their music still respected and listened to. And they see today&#8217;s country as linked across time to that of previous generations. So there&#8217;s evolution, but with continuity. They very much value their traditions. But they haven&#8217;t become imprisoned by them.  Also, Nashville happens to have a stellar business climate, far less corruption than your average Rust Belt city, an openness to outsiders, an increasingly diverse population base, and an aggressiveness towards growth missing in most of the Rust Belt. That&#8217;s not to say Nashville&#8217;s perfect, but they&#8217;ve done a pretty good job of updating their authentic culture while backing it up with an actual product that&#8217;s functional demographically and economically.</p>
<p>If Rust Belt Chic wants to reach its potential, it has to be able to do more than unearth and embrace the authentic culture of a place &#8211; though that&#8217;s important &#8211; it needs to be able to inform cultural evolution and also the very real changes in the product (such as Atlanta&#8217;s striving to shuck itself of the stigma of racism in the South by becoming the &#8220;city too busy to hate&#8221; and in the process becoming America&#8217;s premier city for blacks) needed to make these cities competitive again.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m not sure a massive regional rail system would really be a wise use of funds for Cincinnati. Nor do I believe the full system could have been built without follow-on tax increases as costs are always underestimated. Nevertheless, this represents a major road not traveled for Cincinnati, as it were. Instead, there&#8217;s billions of dollars in highway improvements slated. Time will tell how this and other choices the community has made will pan out.</p>

<p>Ball State scholars Michael Hicks, Srikant Devaraj, Dagney Faulk, Dick Heupel, and Sharon Canaday recently released a paper entitled <a href="http://projects.cberdata.org/reports/PersonalIncome-081213-web.pdf">The Causes of State Differences in Per Capita Income: How Does Indiana Fare? (pdf)</a> Yesterday, Brian Howey offered <a href="http://www.jconline.com/article/20130829/OPINION/308290022">the opinion</a> that Indiana&#8217;s jobs problems are perhaps the result of challenges and limitations at the local government level rather than state economic policy.</p>
<p>The Ball State Report noted that per capita income for Hoosiers ranked 21st in the nation in 1950, 30th in 1980, and 40th as of 2010. There is a verse in the Bible (Mark 4:25) which says &#8220;For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.&#8221; Howard Bloom <a href="http://howardbloom.net/beyond-the-supercomputer-social-groups-as-learning-machines/">likes to use that verse</a> as a way of describing the algorithm by which groups allocate their resources. The group devotes its resources to those parts of the group that appear to be having success as a way of ostensibly maximizing success. You don&#8217;t waste your scarce resources on losing strategies.</p>
<p>Hicks and Howey offer the following (from the Howey column): </p>
<blockquote><p>Hicks explains: “This is a really a local, not state problem. Almost all our local economic policies target business investment, and masquerade as job creation efforts. We abate taxes, apply TIFs and woo businesses all over the state, but then the employees who receive middle-class wages (say $18 an hour or more)<strong> choose the nicest place to live within a 40-mile radius</strong>. So, we bring a nice factory to Muncie, and the employees all commute from Noblesville.”<br />
. . .<br />
[The General Assembly has] passed tax caps that have crimped city budgets. The hope was that municipalities would consolidate, but what’s happened has been cuts in parks budgets and a curtailing of school bus service. <strong>So when cities compete for that new corporation, and the executives survey a city with shabby parks and kids walking to school in 10 degree weather, they go elsewhere.</strong></p>
<p>Hicks said, “As Americans became richer, schooling and community amenities matter more. This is an iron law of economics, that the share of income we spend on some goods rises as we get richer. Education and amenities (like health care and recreation) are two of these things. So, the Midwest built its small towns long before the quality of a place made much difference in migration or incomes. Today, quality of place matters deeply, and we are, in many places, unprepared to deal with it. [emphasis added]”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The highlighted portions brought to my mind Bloom&#8217;s biblical algorithm. The employees with money go to communities that are not deteriorating. The executives choosing new business locations choose communities with parks and schools that are not in disarray. People with resources and choices want to allocate those resources in places that appear to have winning strategies. </p>
<p>This is why Indiana&#8217;s relative per capita income matters. The authors of the Ball State study are quick to point out that Indiana&#8217;s absolute standard of living has improved. The problem, however, is that we have put ourselves on the wrong side of the economic snowball. Those who have are going to put their resources in places that have. We&#8217;re putting ourselves on the &#8220;hath not&#8221; side of the equation; and, if we&#8217;re not careful, even what we have will be taken from us. If our economic policies appeal to low end employers, our people will get low end jobs where the value of our production is taken from us and distributed to the people and places on the &#8220;hath&#8221; side of the equation. The Ball State study shows that there is a large gap in household incomes for those who migrate out of the state versus those who migrate into the state; with poorer families moving in and wealthier families moving out. </p>
<p>The Ball State study also took a look at county level differences; comparing the per capita income in 2010 to the national average over time. The average LaGrange County per capita income in 2010 was the same as the national per capita income in 1964: lagging behind by nearly half a century. Only Hamilton and Boone Counties were ahead of the curve; with per capita incomes at the estimated national average for 2019 and 2018 respectively. Indiana as a whole is at 1996 levels.</p>
<p>Government power is fairly centralized in Indiana, with the General Assembly meddling significantly in local affairs. At some point, there will likely be a renewed battle for local control; with the areas having better prospects seeking to limit their connection to State mandated policies that yoke them to the areas with poorer prospects.</p>

<p>After 16 consecutive months of Indiana&#8217;s jobless rate above the national average &#8211; it&#8217;s 8.4 percent now, compared to 7.4 for the U.S. &#8211; the cold reality is that we have a problem with a quarter of a million Hoosiers chronically out of work.</p>
<p>Then came a Ball State University study showing Indiana&#8217;s per capita income has slipped from 30th in the nation to 40th with dozens of counties wallowing in wage levels in the 1990s and, some like my old home of Miami, in the 1970s range.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://howeypolitics.com/Files/HPI130829.pdf">wrote an analysis</a> in which I noted that for almost the past nine years, we&#8217;ve had Republican governors who have made job creation and education reform top priorities, and yet we&#8217;ve been over 8 percent unemployment since early 2009.</p>
<p>At some point, a political reality comes into play, perhaps as early as 2014 and if this trend persists, by 2016. It used to be that a jobless rate over 7 percent would mean the boot from voters. Yet, Gov. Mitch Daniels left office with a 60 percent approval rating and President Obama was reelected.</p>
<p>Gov. Mike Pence gets it. Speaking before the Indianapolis Kiwanis last Friday, he acknowledged, “There’s a great sense of optimism, there’s reason to be encouraged as Hoosiers, but this is a difficult time for too many in our state.”</p>
<p>At Hobart, Pence told local Realtors, “I want to see where the young people can graduate from high school and can have an industry certification or even an associates degree right that day.”</p>
<p>There was one interesting response to my analysis, and it came from Ball State University economics Prof. Michael Hicks. &#8220;Indiana’s problem is not that the overall business climate for investment is poor (it is great) or that we have too few students graduating from college with the right degrees (they are) or that people outside Indiana don’t know how great these things are (they know),” he explained. “The problem is not statewide (we have 12 counties growing much faster than the nation as a whole). These are just facts. I also don’t believe that the overall problem is one of rapid technological progress or any of the national (and hopefully transient) problems in labor markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, the problem here is much closer to home. It comes in your city or town.</p>
<p>Hicks explains: “This is a really a local, not state problem. Almost all our local economic policies target business investment, and masquerade as job creation efforts. We abate taxes, apply TIF’s and woo businesses all over the state, but then the employees who receive middle class wages (say $18 an hour or more) choose the nicest place to live within a 40-mile radius. So, we bring a nice factory to Muncie, and the employees all commute from Noblesville.&#8221;</p>
<p>The real problem here is that Indiana Republicans parade under the banners of Reaganism, of smaller government and one that stays out of our bedrooms and personal lives. But when our cities and towns seek what we call &#8220;local control&#8221; over tax options, legislative leaders politely listen, and then tell them to shove off.</p>
<p>A classic example came last year when Republican and Democratic mayors from Whiting to Evansville pleaded with the General Assembly to toughen laws on access to methamphetamine ingredients. They were largely ignored, a watered down law passed, and so far in 2013, we&#8217;ve had almost 1,100 meth lab busts that have injured 17 cookers, 18 cops and involved more than 300 children.</p>
<p>They have passed tax caps that have crimped city budgets. The hope was that municipalities would consolidate, but what&#8217;s happened has been cuts in parks budgets and a curtailing of school bus service. So when cities compete for that new corporation, and the executives survey a city with shabby parks and kids walking to school in 10 degree weather, they go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hicks explains, &#8220;As Americans became richer, schooling and community amenities matter more. This is an iron law of economics, that the share of income we spend on some goods rises as we get richer. Education and amenities (like health care and recreation) are two of these things. So, the Midwest built its small towns long before the quality of a place made much difference in migration or incomes. Today, quality of place matters deeply, and we are, in many places, unprepared to deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Power has become centralized at the Indiana City Council (i.e. Indiana General Assembly), which has capped taxes, overridden local gun laws and constantly tinkers in municipal affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both parties have been complicit to some degree in the long march towards centralizing power at the state and federal level that has weakened the capacity of local government to address their problems,&#8221; Hicks explains. &#8220;It will take some serious assistance, both technical and financial, for a state like Indiana to help most communities emerge from the dire straits they are in. Even then, many places face a dismal future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ironic aspect to this is that the chronic 8 percent jobless rate may be just the thing that flushes the central scrutinizers in the House and Senate out of office over the next two election cycles.</p>
<p>You reap what you sow, senator, if the voters make this connection.</p>

Poor demographics and economics lead to fiscal problems that result in more people and businesses leaving, perpetuating a downward spiral. Detroit, which recently filed bankruptcy, is an extreme case, but many cities and states find themselves in similar straits, including much of New England and especially most of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>How to places break out of this and renew prosperity? Looking at cities where there has been change, I have observed several basic patterns of turnaround.</p>
<h3>Structural Changes</h3>
<p>Many cities failed for structural economic reasons like deindustrialization and globalization. Similarly, many ended up reviving for similar external reasons. In her seminal book <em>The Global City</em>, Saskia Sassen noted that while globalization permitted the dispersal of economic activities to lower cost locations, it created a parallel need for specialized financial and producer services to manage and control those global production networks. These services were disproportionately concentrated in so-called “global cities” like New York and London. While once those cities had fallen on hard times (in NYC’s case, nearly going bankrupt itself in the 1970s), globalization more than any other factor perhaps brought them back to life. Unfortunately, localities have no ability to conjure up these macro-economic changes.</p>
<h3>Natural Lifecycle Progression</h3>
<p>In a few places, notably Pittsburgh, it seems that the problems simply reached the end of their life cycle. To borrow a phase, they “hit bottom” and started reviving, if slowly. Of course, many places hit bottom and stayed there. Pittsburgh has been helped by the presence of large, world-class institutions. Being in the Marcellus Shale formation that’s the epicenter of the American gas fracking boom doesn’t hurt. It’s worth nothing that Pittsburgh has been fairly slow growth and still faces big challenges, including major pension and infrastructure problems.</p>
<h3>Outsider Influx</h3>
<p>Other cities hit a growth inflection point when they were able to attract a critical mass of outsiders. I have argued that having a critical mass of outsiders, that is, of people who aren’t long time natives or “boomerang” migrants, is <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2010/04/02/replay-the-outsiders/" target="_blank">almost a prerequisite for major civic change</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You need them, and you need enough of them that they a) don’t get beaten down by the man, so to speak and b) that they become a base of support for change in their own right. Once this group becomes large enough, it opens up the field of possibilities. They have the insights and different ideas from having lived elsewhere. They aren’t bought into the status quo or burdened by the baggage of the past. They are willing to question they way things are done. They are more likely to want change. In short, outsiders are the natural constituency for the new. That’s why outsiders are so important for a community to change, and why absent enough newcomers, change is difficult if not impossible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this almost begs the question: how do you attract those outsiders? This would appear to be a second order factor. It would be worth doing a deep dive on how significant inward migration began in these places. Also, the places that seemed to do well on this model – like Nashville or Denver – are places that weren’t in terrible shape to begin with.</p>
<h3>Transformational Leaders</h3>
<p>Any number of cities lend themselves to a narrative of transformational change led by a particular leader or group of leaders. You can think of Richard M. Daley in Chicago or Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg in New York. Cory Booker in Newark may be an emerging story in this mold. Or in previous generations there were business magnates like J. Irwin Miller in Columbus, Indiana that through superior vision combined with clout were able to put their community on a different path than other similarly positioned cities. (Among other things, Columbus, Indiana is an internationally renowned center of modernist architecture, with no fewer than six National Historic Landmarks in a modernist style).</p>
<p>The obvious question here is how much leadership had to do with it. So many of these large tier one type cities came back at the same time that it seems likely some common outside force like globalization was the real driver. Or at least that it was a prerequisite to enable the leadership to be effective. However, there are some examples like Columbus that appear to be less the result of outside forces.</p>
<h3>Civic Sector Led Revitalization</h3>
<p>Some cities have done well in models without a single dominant leader such as a larger than life mayor. In Indianapolis, for example, it was a broader coalition of business, community, and institutional leaders that championed items such as their sports hosting strategy that had a transformational impact. This is the model most cities try to use, but it has failed nine times out of ten in delivering transformational impact, so would appear to be a very high risk strategy.</p>
<p>What other models suggest themselves? I won&#8217;t claim this as a comprehensive list.</p>
<h3>A Look At Providence and Rhode Island</h3>
<p>Where does Rhode Island fit in? Well, it hasn’t seen a turnaround yet. But there has been a sort of slow growth in personal incomes that could add up over time. In this light, Providence would be a sort of Pittsburgh-like city from a lifecycle perspective, though I should note with a much smaller asset base. Alon Levy made the case for this view last year <a href="http://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/providence-the-quiet-revival/" target="_blank">in a piece called “The Quiet Revival”</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rhode Island may have one of the highest unemployment rates in the US today, but income growth is high; things are slowly getting better. The most visible growth in the US is in population rather than income, and so the usual markers are new housing starts, new infrastructure, and a lot of “coming soon” signs. Providence of course doesn’t have much of this. Instead, people are getting richer, slowly… Economic growth in the richest countries is slow enough that people don’t perceive it. Instead, they think it’s the domain of countries that are catching up, such as China, where it’s so fast it includes new construction and the other markers that signify population growth in the first world. In the long run, it matters that a city’s income grows 1.8% a year rather than 1.1%, but it’s not visible enough to be captured by trend articles until long after the spurt of growth has started.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the lack of structural economic forces boosting the city, and a comparatively small base of newcomers, particularly outside of Providence proper and other core cities, this will likely have to do for now, unless we witness the emergence of a disruptive and transformational type leader.</p>

This is something I&#8217;ve long argued we urbanists do a poor job of. We tend to adopt a &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; marketing approach to quality of life initiatives where the connection between cause and effect is tenuous. Additionally, these tend to focus almost entirely on and tell stories about &#8220;the best and brightest&#8221; which in a country dying for middle class jobs can rightly cause the majority of folks to ask: why would we support spending money on that? That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s critical to tell stories &#8211; to tell them loud and tell them often &#8211; that show the link between quality of life and economic development, and also how these relate to the average person on the street.</p>
<p>The announcement in question is the <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20130829/LOCAL01/308290043/San-Diego-firm-move-headquarters-Carmel-bring-675-jobs?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|IndyStar.com">relocation of a company called American Specialty Health</a> from La Jolla, CA to the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel. This will involve 300 initial hires, growing to 675. While the company will retain a California operation as well as one near Dallas, the headquarters will be in Carmel, IN and 50 top managers, including the CEO, are relocating.</p>
<p>Why is the company moving to/growing in Indianapolis? Central location and costs. Plus the CEO has a personal connection of sorts to Indiana. (He attended Culver Academy, an elite military boarding school, but one located in northern Indiana nowhere near Indianapolis and of which most Hoosiers have never heard). </p>
<p>Why is this relevant to the average person? There will be top executives and such relocating, as well as new employees added in high skill areas like IT. However, this is also a general operations center containing what appears to be every type of employee, right down to customer service and call center types. This enables people who aren&#8217;t elite techies or execs and who might not even have college degrees to potentially be hired on. While the company is an an upscale location, it&#8217;s easily commutable from more average places like Tipton County, and commuting will be made easier when US 31 is converted to a freeway (which is in progress).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the link to quality of life investment: how do you get these call center and IT and other jobs? You do it by convincing 50 people, including the CEO, to move from La Jolla, which if you don&#8217;t know is, to put it mildly, a nice place to live. The average home price is north of $2 million. The people who live there (or elsewhere in the San Diego region and commute in) aren&#8217;t there because it&#8217;s cheap. These are people with enough money to buy nice stuff and with choices about where to live. Like most of us they are probably interested in saving a buck, but not at the expense of moving to the equivalent of Siberia. </p>
<p>I have written extensively before about the <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2010/05/23/next-american-suburb-carmel-indiana/">major quality of life improvement initiatives</a> in Carmel, IN. This is a validation that those improvements have tangible benefits. While Carmel has long been a destination for estate homes for the wealthy of Indianapolis, it was not really at that level nationally. Now it may be that some of the ops jobs could have been won without the headquarters, but certainly that HQ represents a huge commitment to the community. And I can tell you that a decade ago these jobs simply would not have been addressable in Indianapolis/Carmel. It wouldn&#8217;t have even been in the discussion. Today because of the quality of life improvements, there&#8217;s a much larger addressable market for economic development wins like this. Without that investment, had the ASH HQ moved from San Diego it probably would have ended up in Dallas.</p>
<p>Carmel&#8217;s quality of life investments have been controversial in many quarters, sometimes justifiably so. There definitely needs to be a debate on these things. But a more Tea Party aligned city council majority has clamped down in opposition to these things. While I think they have been right to criticize certain things, hopefully this will prompt them to understand the value of what&#8217;s been going on. And it&#8217;s to their credit that they were very collaborative in and supportive of winning the deal for this company. Incidentally, Indy Star reporter Dan McFeely says that while there are state tax incentives, there are zero local tax incentives for this move. That speaks for itself.</p>
<p>I also want to review a couple of other local examples I&#8217;ve already highlighted in the past. Medco opened a mail order pharmacy distribution center employing 1,300 in Whitetown, a suburbanizing area northwest of Indianapolis. Sprawl? Yes, but major distribution centers have to go somewhere and I don&#8217;t think the urban core is the best place.</p>
<p>Medco obviously employs a number of six figure pharmacists, but I can assure you the focus is doing as much as possible with machines and lower priced pharmacy technician labor. You can be a pharmacy tech without a college degree. Additionally, pharmacy tech jobs at Medco come with full benefits.</p>
<p>How did Indy win Medco? Reportedly for a few reasons. First, Indiana moved much faster than competitor Kentucky in getting the regulatory authorization in place. Second, proximity to the Fed Ex hub (not a distinguisher vs. Louisville, but a necessary attribute) and pharmacy schools at Purdue and Butler. But third was that Indianapolis had <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?p=16433186&#038;postcount=981">needed amentities that were beneficial to entertaining customers</a>.</p>
<p>You have to take any claims in announcements with a grain of salt, but it&#8217;s obvious that all of these are prima facie valid. Whitestown is within easy commuting distance of lots of rural and small town Indiana areas in places like Clinton and Montgomery County. Why are investments not just in obvious items like professional schools and transport infrastructure, but creating an environment you can entertain the executives of your customers in downtown Indianapolis important? Well, if you&#8217;re a single mother with a high school diploma from Clinton County who can get a decent job with benefits at Medco, it&#8217;s obvious why it&#8217;s important to you. But that&#8217;s a story that doesn&#8217;t get told, making it easy to criticize downtown investments as simply catering to fatcats. </p>
<p>Similarly, just 45 minutes south of downtown Indy is the thriving small manufacturing city of Columbus, Indiana. It is <a href="http://www.urbanophile.com/2010/07/11/the-columbus-indiana-values-proposition/">hands down the best performing small city in Indiana</a> despite having the second highest percentage of its jobs in manufacturing. It&#8217;s also the top recipient of Japanese foreign direct investment (as measured by the number of firms) in Indiana after Indianapolis. </p>
<p>Why do Japanese manufacturers find Columbus a good place to do business? Not only it is pro-business and low cost, it also has a focus on design quality, including a world-renowned collection of modernist architectural masterpieces by the likes of Eero Saarinen and I. M. Pei. The Japanese are famously design conscious and also focus on competing through high quality and engineering excellence, not just low costs. This is speculation, but I can&#8217;t help but think that the link between the Japanese ethos and that of Columbus created a values fit. And keep in mind that those foreign manufacturers have to convince their plant managers and such to relocate &#8211; with their families &#8211; to the community in question. Columbus&#8217; approach made it easier to make the sale. Because if those Japanese executives didn&#8217;t want to live in Columbus, all those regular Hoosier folks working in the Japanese plants wouldn&#8217;t have jobs.</p>
<p>In any case, in a competitive world, only firms that deliver excellence as well as cost effectiveness can survive the brutal global competition. Which workers are more likely to produce excellent products, ones that demand excellence in their own communities, or ones who embrace mediocrity? How can any investor believe that residents who tolerate a run down, mediocre community for their own families to live in will suddenly start taking pride in the products coming off their employers’ production lines? It makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>Low costs, low taxes, and a business friendly environment are clearly important. In fact, if you don&#8217;t have some stunning advantage like Southern California&#8217;s climate or NYC&#8217;s unparalleled talent base, it&#8217;s almost the price of admission. But that&#8217;s all it is &#8211; table stakes. In an era where quality global labor is available at prices no American place can match, you just can&#8217;t win on low costs alone.</p>
<p>This is why the Tea Party mentality which <a href="http://www.publicsectorinc.com/psi_articles/2013/08/why-cities-give-republicans-the-brush-off.html">treats government purely as a fiscal engine</a> in which the only goal is to reduce the dollars coming in and going out is so destructive in the long term.  Because competing purely on low costs only works if you are the low cost producer like Wal-Mart. And 95%+ of American communities have no basis to claim to be that. </p>
<p>You would think that in states that are struggling, policy makers would go look at the places that are doing well, find out what those places are doing right and then figure out how to get other places to start doing some of that. Some things can&#8217;t be replicated. There&#8217;s only one Indiana University, and it&#8217;s in Bloomington. But there are lots of strategies and approaches that are more broadly applicable. Sadly, not many leaders seem interested in that. In fact, many of them seem more interested in stopping anybody from doing more of what places like Columbus and Carmel have done.</p>
<p>Unquestionably there needs to be a debate about whether any particular expense makes sense. Without a doubt many proposals are boondoggles and should be rejected. Places like Indiana aren&#8217;t San Diego and absolutely need to keep low costs, a strong balance sheet, and a light regulatory touch. But that in and of itself is not enough to attract businesses. You might gain some low-wage table scraps that way, but not many jobs that pay decent wages for the average person.</p>
<p>Places that want to be competitive in the modern economy need an environment that is relevant to the 21st century, not the 1970s. But to make the case for that investment it&#8217;s important to start identifying how these make a tangible impact and really making the case and telling the stories about them.</p>

Since I&#8217;ve been covering Cincinnati this week, I thought I&#8217;d show the damage freeways did there too.</p>
<p>Over the Rhine is one of America&#8217;s most stunning historic districts. When I visited the city last year, one of the locals explained that there had been &#8220;miles&#8221; of neighborhoods just like it obliterated by freeway construction. I found this difficult to credit until I came across the photographic proof.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of one such area, the West End. This photo dates to the late 1950&#8242;s:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a Google satellite view of the area today. Pretty much everything but Cincinnati Union Terminal appears to have been demolished and replaced with I-75 and an industrial park.</p>

<p>Lest you think Union Terminal survived unscathed, it appears in the 1950s photo that it had a sort of City Beautiful style formal plaza in front of it. Here&#8217;s a closer look:</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the Google satellite from today that shows it converted into &#8211; what else! &#8211; a parking lot:</p>

<p>Almost empty, of course.</p>
