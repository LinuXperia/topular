For three decades, the Active Transportation Alliance (formerly the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation) has been advocating for better conditions for bicycling and, in recent years, walking and transit. They marked their 30th anniversary with a fundraiser on Monday at Germania Place, and more than 250 supporters turned out to celebrate the occasion. <a href=http://chi.streetsblog.org/2016/02/25/active-trans-celebrates-30-years-with-a-new-commitment-to-healthy-streets/>[...]</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"John Greenfield";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10408:"<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a title="IMG_5649" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24858199@N00/24950730600" data-flickr-embed="true"><img class="" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1708/24950730600_c77ff79842_z.jpg" alt="IMG_5649" width="250" height="346" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ron Burke.

<p>For three decades, the <a href="http://activetrans,org" target="_blank">Active Transportation Alliance</a> (formerly the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation) has been advocating for better conditions for bicycling and, in recent years, walking and transit. They marked their 30th anniversary with a fundraiser on Monday at Germania Place, and more than 250 supporters turned out to celebrate the occasion. During the event the group gave public service awards to three key players in the local sustainable transportation scene: former Tribune transportation reporter Jon Hilkevitch, <a href="http://www.majortaylortrail.org/FOMTT_1.0/index.htm" target="_blank">Friends of the Major Taylor Trail</a> president Peter Taylor, and U.S. Congressman Dan Lipinski.</p>
<p>Active Trans director Ron Burke kicked off the evening by discussing how much attitudes about transportation have changed over the years. “When I first started bike commuting during the winter, people used to look at me with shock and awe,” he said. “Now on Milwaukee Avenue during the summer, we’re seeing 5,000 bikes a day and bikes are piling up at suburban Metra stations.” He noted that while CTA ridership bottomed out during the 1990s, when it was easy to get a seat on the North Red Line, 2015 saw the <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2016/02/12/cta-ridership-report-train-use-hits-record-levels-bus-ridership-still-falling/">highest rail ridership in 58 years</a>.</p>
<p>Burke said that 30 years ago, the region saw a much higher rate of traffic injuries and fatalities, which he blamed on “a vision that was basically, move cars as fast as possible.” However, he noted, in recent years we’ve seen the emergence of better pedestrian facilities, bus rapid transit, protected bike lanes, Divvy, and The 606. “These are things which 20 or 30 years ago were barely on the radar but now are a reality, in part because of the work Active Trans has done over the last 30 years.”</p>
<p>Jon Hilkevitch recently ended a 36-year tour of duty at the Trib, with half of that time spent covering the transportation beat, including publishing the popular “<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/hilkevitch/" target="_blank">Getting Around</a>” column, which largely focused on the commuting needs of average Chicagoans. Of course, Streetsblog Chicago didn’t always seen eye-to-eye with Hilkevitch, particularly when it came to his <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2013/05/30/hilkevitch-plays-dumb-with-an-anti-divvy-expose/">early skepticism about bike-share</a>.</p>
<p>But his articles were generally well researched and written, and he eventually <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2013/08/19/the-tribs-jon-hilkevitch-changes-his-tune-reports-divvy-is-a-success/">came around on the Divvy issue</a>. I was also pleasantly surprised by his comments in <a href="http://activetrans.org/blog/hilkevitch-reflects-local-active-transportation-landscape">a recent Active Trans interview</a>, in which he expressed his support for bus rapid transit and people-friendly street reconfigurations, which I hadn’t gathered from his articles. It even turns out that he’s a regular bike commuter, who used to pedal 12 miles each day to the Tribune tower back when he lived in Evanston.</p>

<p>During his acceptance speech, Hilkevitch discussed the need to reduce the number of traffic fatalities on Chicago streets. He recalled that one of his most difficult interviews was with the mother of Clint Micelli, a 22-year-old graphic designer <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-03-20/classified/ct-met-getting-around-0221-20110320_1_dooring-clinton-miceli-bicyclists">who was fatally doored</a> while riding a bike on LaSalle Street on the Near North Side. “Thanks to Active Trans’ efforts, that led to new legislation requiring the police to keep records of dooring crashes,” Hilkevitch said. “A day when there are no more ghost bikes will truly be a day to celebrate.”</p>
<p>Peter Taylor, an Active Trans board member, was a tireless advocate for completing the Southwest Side’s Major Taylor Trail, named for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Taylor" target="_blank">turn-of-the-century bike racing legend</a>. Now he serves as a guardian of the trail, pushing for better amenities and trying to ensure the path is well maintained and glass-free. He is also part of a coalition of local African-American bike advocates who have lobbied the city for a more <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2014/12/19/advocates-request-a-fair-share-of-bike-resources-for-black-communities/">equitable distribution of bike resources</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>During his speech, Peter Taylor gave shout-outs to Major Taylor, who overcame racism to become one of the nation&#8217;s first Black sports stars, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “for demanding that government live up to its promises equally.” He added that he’s looking forward to the expansion of the Cal-Sag Trail in the south suburbs, because it will link up with the Major Taylor Trail, “and a new cycling network will be born.”</p>

Recently, helped pass the new federal transportation bill, as well as reinstating the national tax benefit for transit commuters.</p>
<p>“Why do I care about this stuff?” Lipinski said. “It’s not because my constituents are beating down my door.” He added that he wished that more local residents appreciated the importance of greener, healthier transportation for the region.</p>
<p>He noted that his grandfather was a Chicago trolley operator and bus driver, and that since he was a child, walking, biking, and “the big green limousine” (the old nickname for the CTA, back before it got its current color scheme) have been a big part of his life.</p>
<p>Lipinski highlighted bipartisanship as a key strategy for achieving transportation goals. He recalled that, back in 2010, there was a bill in the House transportation committee that would have gutted funding for pedestrian, bike, and transit initiatives. New York City’s <a href="http://transalt.org" target="_blank">Transportation Alternatives</a> advocacy group allied with local Republican politicians to help defeat the legislation, and formed a bipartisan transit caucus to prevent such cuts in the future.</p>

<p>As is usually the case at these kind of events, remarks from Active Trans’ founding director Randy Neufeld, now with the <a href="http://sramcyclingfund.org" target="_blank">SRAM Cycling Fund</a>, were a highlight of the evening. “I apologize that it still isn’t as comfortable and convenient to bicycle in Chicago as in Amsterdam or Copenhagen,” he joked. “What the hell have we been doing for the last 30 years? When we started, we were brave, bold, and tireless, and mostly clueless, and it never would have occurred to us that Dutch bikeways could be tested in the U.S.”</p>
<p>However, he noted, over the years the group looked at best practices in European cities and U.S. cycling capitals, and also developed political skills, engaging with Chicago mayors and transportation officials, as well as leaders throughout the region. “In the last 15 years the vision has come into clear focus,” he said. “It is bringing the joy of active transportation into our daily lives, a comfortable choice free of danger for all incomes, all neighborhoods, all ages.”</p>
<p>Neufeld added that the enemy of this goal is the inertia of the current transportation system. “Few truly love our car-dependent world, and most people would embrace changes but change is still really, really hard,” he said. “Most of our nine-million-person region was built with just one mode of transport in mind.”</p>
<p>He said that Active Trans has developed various “power packs” as strategies to zoom over the barriers in the way of achieving their vision, including multimodalism, regional influence, commitment to equity, and a strong staff. Neufeld then laid out the organization’s four major campaigns for the near future: 8-to-80 bikeways, walking and cycling education and encouragement for children, the <a href="http://transitfuture.org" target="_blank">Transit Future</a> funding effort, and the Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that Active Trans can shift its advocacy efforts into high gear in the coming years and help make their dream of a less car-dependent region, with safe, healthy, and fun transportation options for all Chicagoland residents, a reality.</p>

<p>A bad economy, an unfriendly state government and a steady trickle of Cleveland sprawl are killing the system, which is by far the most robust in the state of Ohio, RTA General Manager Joe Calabrese said at a mobility event Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marc Lefkowitz at Network blog <a href="http://www.gcbl.org/blog/2016/02/greater-cleveland-rta-head-joe-calabrese-warns-ohio-to-wake-up-or-miss-out" target="_blank">Green City Blue Lake</a> caught the speech and summarized:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Joe Calabrese left Central New York RTA to take the helm at <a>Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority</a> 16 years ago, 1.392 million people lived in Cuyahoga County, where they provide 1 cent on every purchase to support RTA operations. The sales tax contribution covers more than 70% of RTA’s operating budget, but has been sliding since 11 separate transit companies merged under the regional banner in 1978 when 1.539 million county residents contributed.</p>
<p>A one-two punch of job losses and sprawl has dominated Calabrese’s tenure as CEO and general manager, the longest of any major, U.S. transit system boss, according to his introduction at today’s <a href="http://www.oldstonechurch.org/programs/hope-for-the-city-2016" target="_blank">Hope for the City: Mobility Matters series</a> at the Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland.</p>
<p>By 2010, another 100,000 people had left Cuyahoga County and wouldn’t be supporting RTA with its purchase power. When the U.S. Census came out, RTA would also have to contend with the federal government trimming $3 million (based on population size) from its budget.</p>
<p>Reeling from the recession, RTA faced possibly its worst year of revenues. Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers had an opportunity to ride in and preserve RTA, the largest transit system in the state and in the Top 20 in the country. Ohio refused Calabrese’s modest proposal to <a href="http://www.gcbl.org/blog/2010/01/coalition-to-save-ohios-transit-needs-help-building-support-at-januarys-public-hearings">increase its funding support</a> 3% per year, and RTA was forced to make deep cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, state support for transit has dwindled from $43 million a year at the beginning of Calabrese&#8217;s tenure to just $7 million today. RTA&#8217;s share of that is a measly $225,000.</p>
<p><span id="more-108683"></span></p>
<p>Lefkowitz says when it comes to fare hikes, Calabrese is pointing directly at the state:</p>
<blockquote><p>“People ask why we’re doing this,” he said. “We have a (state) partner asleep at the wheel. On the highway, by the way.”</p>
<p>“We don’t want to lose customers,” Calabrese continued. “We’ve done a lot to control costs internally.”</p>
<p>He hinted that the latest round of service cuts will likely affect 1.5% of RTA customers. Ten percent of those will lose all service; the rest of the cuts will come where “the least amount of people are being served, and where those have options.”</p></blockquote>

Last summer, a Chicago Park District spokeswoman told me that, according to the park district code, it’s legal to commute on the Bloomingdale Trail at all times of day. But in the wake of the mugging of a cyclist on the greenway last Friday night, the agency seems to have flip-flopped on the issue – <a href=http://chi.streetsblog.org/2016/02/24/legalizing-247-commuting-on-the-bloomingdale-trail-would-make-it-safer/>[...]</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"John Greenfield";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5074:"<p><a title="IMG_5009" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24858199@N00/18314004973"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/500/18314004973_f38b018be1_z.jpg" alt="cyclist riding on the Bloomingdale Trail" width="580" height="435" /></a></p>
<p>Last summer, <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2015/06/30/police-park-district-still-disagree-about-late-night-travel-on-the-606/" target="_blank">a Chicago Park District spokeswoman told me</a> that, according to the park district code, it’s legal to commute on the Bloomingdale Trail at all times of day. But in the wake of the mugging of a cyclist on the greenway last Friday night, the agency seems to have flip-flopped on the issue – a spokeswoman implied that the 2.7-mile facility is closed between 11 p.m. and 6 p.m. However, if it was open 24/7, that would improve safety because there would more “eyes on the trail.”</p>
<p>Some 80,000 people live within a half mile of the Bloomingdale, aka The 606, and many of these residents regularly bike commute home from work or entertainment after 11 p.m. It’s only logical that these people should be allowed to use this car-free route to get home safely, rather than take their chances with drunk drivers on busy North Avenue or Armitage Avenue.</p>
<p>Last June spokeswoman Michele Lemons told me that – <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2014/05/30/the-lakefront-trail-really-is-open-all-day-all-night/">as on the Lakefront Trail</a> – nonstop walking and biking are permitted on the elevated path due to an ingress and egress provision in <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/assets/1/23/CPD_Code_Chapter_7.pdf">the park district code</a>. &#8220;Persons and vehicles may pass through such parks without stopping on the more direct walk or driveway leading from their point of entrance to the exit nearest to their point of destination,” the code states. Lemons said this allows commuters to use paths through parks, including The 606, for transportation.</p>
<p>However, in practice, police officers enforce the city’s usual 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. parks curfew by clearing the Bloomingdale at 11 sharp. When they encounter people commuting on foot or by bike on the path after hours, they order the trail users to leave. Last summer Officer Janel Sedevic from Police News Affairs confirmed this is the department’s current protocol.</p>
<p>After I notified Sedevic and Lemons that the two policies were in conflict, they said they would get in touch with each other and resolve the issue.</p>
<p>On Friday at around 11:30 p.m., a 25-year-old man was biking on the trail near Kedzie Avenue when he was jumped and mugged by four males, <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160223/humboldt-park/cyclist-pulled-off-bike-robbed-on-606-trail-humboldt-park-police" target="_blank">DNAinfo reported</a>. They pulled him off his cycle, beat him, and took his wallet, phone, before leaving the scene, according to police.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was biking home from work in Lakeview and took the trail because there were a lot of cars out, and I have ridden late at night before without incident,” the victim told DNA.</p>
<p>In the wake of the attack, park district spokeswoman Jessica Maxey-Faulkner indicated that it was illegal for the cyclist, as well as the assailants, to be on the trail at the time, referring to the fact that the parks are usually closed between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Therefore it appears that the park district and the police department are now on the same page. Unfortunately it’s the wrong page.</p>
<p><span id="more-108650"></span></p>
<p>Unlike <a href="http://thehighline.org" target="_blank">New York City’s popular High Line</a> elevated trail, the Bloomingdale doesn’t have gates and it’s not locked at night. The 606 does have security cameras at each of its 12 access points plus cams at other locations where a bend in the trail obscures the view.</p>
<p>But an easy way to help prevent repeats of Friday’s assault and save work for the police would be to allow cyclists and pedestrians to legally commute on the trail all night, in keeping with the park district code. After all, as long as late-night trail use is outlawed, only outlaws will use the trail after hours.</p>
<p>This recent incident may discourage some people from biking home on the trail after 11 p.m. &#8212; the victim said he&#8217;ll avoid the trail at night from now on. But many people will continue to do so, because the path provides an alternative to sharing busy streets with drunk drivers. Legalizing this behavior would make it safer by providing more potential witnesses, which would discourage criminal activity.</p>
<p>Rather than shooing people off the trail who simply want to get home in one piece, the police could spend more time addressing serious crime issues. And more biking and walking trips on the trail would mean fewer traffic crashes on surface streets.</p>
<p>The only people who’d lose out in a scenario where The 606 is legal to commute on 24/7 are the would-be trail bandits.</p>

<p>As we wrote the other day, <a href="http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/clearing-snow-from-protected-bike-lanes-the-ins-and-outs">clearing snow and ice from protected bike lanes</a> isn&#8217;t hard. It just requires some effort.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Chattanooga, Tennessee, that&#8217;s no problem. This winter, to keep their protected bike lane on Broad Street rideable through the snow, road crews there set up a <a href="https://www.kawasaki.com/Products/2016-Mule-610-4x4">Kawasaki Mule</a> to trickle just the right amount of brine into the space between curb and planters:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KcqtU4tndM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As other cities have discovered, early de-icing treatments can be especially useful on protected bike lanes, because unlike cars, bikes don&#8217;t tend to splash liquid de-icers away when they pass through. And early de-icing is especially important, because bike tires don&#8217;t break thin layers of ice as they form. If you don&#8217;t de-ice a protected bike lane early in a big snow event, the lane could be out of commission for a day or more.</p>
<p><span id="more-108656"></span></p>
<p>Tony Boyd, deputy director for Chattanooga&#8217;s operations team, said Wednesday that this was the city&#8217;s first attempt to create a machine for de-icing bike lanes and it&#8217;s working well so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Kawasaki Mule is used downtown to do a lot of our herbicide applications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We just picked up a polypropalene tank from the co-op and had our shop mount it on a palette so we can take it in and out of the unit when we want to. &#8230; We built a PVC pipe in the shape of an upside-down T and then we just drilled the pipe in a way that it disperses the brine across the lane. That&#8217;s the way we do it with all our larger trucks too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boyd credited street maintenance manager Ricky Colston with the design.</p>
<p>&#8220;It works out pretty well,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>However, the future of TIGER is far from certain, writes Stephen Lee Davis at <a href="http://t4america.org/2016/02/23/though-congress-passed-a-transportation-bill-funding-for-key-programs-still-up-in-the-air/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+transportationforamerica+%28Transportation+For+America+%28All%29%29" target="_blank">Transportation for America</a>. T4A is urging TIGER supporters to contact senators about continuing the program:</p>
<blockquote><p>The TIGER competitive grant program is one of the few ways that local communities of almost any size can directly receive federal dollars for their priority transportation projects. Unlike the overwhelming majority of all federal transportation dollars that are awarded via formulas to ensure that everyone gets a share, regardless of how they plan to spend it, TIGER projects compete against each other and are selected on their merits to ensure that each dollar is spent in the most effective way possible.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-108647"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>This competition spurs innovation, leverages federal funding by matching it with greater local dollars and awards funding to projects that provide a high return on investment. Choosing projects based on their potential benefits is exactly the direction that transportation spending needs to move in, and we need to ensure that this vital program continues.</p>
<p>Because TIGER was not even <em>authorized</em> in the <a href="http://t4america.org/2015/12/02/think-fast-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-congress-new-five-year-transportation-bill/">five-year FAST Act</a> and therefore wholly lacks any certainty of funding, congressional appropriators play an incredibly important role in deciding once again how much funding to provide for TIGER (and other key transportation programs) in the coming year. We want to ensure that the Senate’s key committee begins the process by providing <strong>at least</strong> the full $500 million they’ve provided in the past.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Members of Congress need to hear from you today.

<p class="DropCap">Maybe they should call it Dead Man&#8217;s Curve. Just southeast of Oak Street Beach, there&#8217;s a bend in the Lakefront Trail where it turns south, hugging Lake Shore Drive. As you head downtown, there&#8217;s a wall on your right, and the path&#8217;s concrete surface slopes down toward the water&#8217;s edge, where there&#8217;s a sheer drop of several feet into Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>During the winter, this hump of land is pounded by waves. After it snows, the waves turn the path into an arctic wasteland of ice boulders, forcing bike riders to dismount and walk their steeds or detour to Inner Lake Shore Drive. At other times, the surf transforms the trail into an angled skating rink that&#8217;s also a serious hazard. The curve is especially dangerous for southbound riders, who often fail to see the slick conditions before they round the blind curve. By then it&#8217;s usually too late to hit the brakes.</p>
<p>When such conditions exist, the Chicago Park District, which is responsible for maintaining the bikeway, barricades the curve with sawhorses and sends out alerts on Twitter that the section of lakefront is closed. But bike riders like Joe DeCeault hope a permanent solution can be found to fix the most perilous spot on the 18.5-mile-long trail.</p>
<div class="unruly_in_article_placement">
<div class="unruly_ia_furniture">
<p>DeCeault, who works as a Web producer for WBEZ, knows all too well what a death trap the ice-glazed incline can be. In February 2012, during his first season of winter biking, he was doing a training ride on a skinny-tired road bike on a particularly windy morning.</p>
<p>Convinced by what he saw farther north that the curve would be ice free, he confidently rounded the bend at a high speed. Then he looked down and saw he was entering a long, slippery stretch. He realized he had to pump his brakes. &#8220;As I did, I noticed the wheels start to slide,&#8221; he wrote in an e-mail. &#8220;My body and bike tilted sideways. Shit!&#8221;</p>
<p>DeCeault fell from his bike and landed hard on his side and stomach. &#8220;It stung like a b&#8212;-,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;I grabbed at the ground to halt my journey towards the lake.&#8221; He came to a stop, but when he lifted his head, he saw his bike continue to slide towards the edge of the path. &#8220;My bike kept going and going and going until—bloop—it dropped off the edge of the concrete and into the lake.&#8221;</p>
<div style="width: 584px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="screen_shot_2016-02-23_at_1.00.22_pm" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24858199@N00/24856136669/in/dateposted-public/"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1671/24856136669_4696bf63fe_o.png" alt="screen_shot_2016-02-23_at_1.00.22_pm" width="574" height="321" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screen shot from 2004 footage that showed 18 cyclists falling at Oak Street in the course of a few minutes. NBC Chicago</p></div>
<p>DeCeault is far from the only local cyclist to crash due to perilous conditions at the Oak Street curve. An <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/stories/Crashing-Waves-Wreak-Havoc-for-Chicago-Bikers-231596121.html" target="_blank">NBC Chicago clip</a> from January 2014 showed 18 riders wiping out on black ice at the spot, sometimes two at a time, over the course of a few minutes.</p>
<p>The mayhem resembles something out of a Keystone Cops flick. &#8220;There goes another one, down, down, down,&#8221; chuckles the cameraman.</p>
<p>The persistence of the problems isn&#8217;t so funny. I checked out the path in the middle of last week, a few days after a couple inches of snow had fallen. The Oak Street curve was shellacked with ice and snow, and the trail was barricaded between the beach and the construction site of the Navy Pier Flyover. This $60 million elevated path will soar over Grand Avenue and Illinois Street, eliminating a dangerous trail bottleneck. Much of this stretch was impassable for bike riders, and treacherous for people walking and jogging.</p>
<p>In addition to the flyover, the city recently completed the $31.5 million <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2015/12/21/take-a-virtual-ride-on-the-new-section-of-the-lakefront-trail-at-fullerton/" target="_blank">Fullerton Revetment project</a>, which built 5.8 acres of new lakefront parkland at Fullerton Avenue, and relocated a section of the trail so it&#8217;s less exposed to waves.</p>
<p>So are there any plans to fix the Oak Street curve problem in the long term?</p>

<p>Sanchez was transported to Illinois Masonic Hospital Center in critical condition, police said. He was pronounced dead that morning, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.</p>
<p>Police are currently searching for the driver, according to Officer José Estrada from News Affairs. They hope to recover footage of the crash from security cameras installed on nearby businesses. People with information about the crash are asked to call Major Accidents at 312-745-4521.</p>
<p>About 36 relatives and friends of the victim held a candlelight vigil at the crash site on Monday evening, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-avondale-hit-and-run-vigil-20160222-story.html" target="_blank">the Tribune reported</a>. Sanchez, an auto mechanic, lived with his father about a mile east of the crash site on the 3100 block of North Sawyer. The two men had been planning to visit the grave of Sanchez’s mother, who died from cancer last March.</p>
<p>Relatives noted that Sanchez has been suffering from insomnia since his mother’s death, and was in the habit of going for long walks late at night, which may explain why he was out early in the morning.</p>
<p>“He was hardworking, smart, respectful and family-oriented,” Sanchez’s brother José Sanchez said. “He was a great guy. Everyone who knew him would say he was a great guy.”</p>

<p>Missouri lawmakers are really grasping for ways to keep the highway money flowing, after voters <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/08/06/missouri-says-no-to-amendment-7s-monster-tax-hike-for-roads/" target="_blank">rejected</a> a regressive sales tax hike backed by road builders in 2014.</p>
<p>Richard Bose at <a href="http://www.nextstl.com/2016/02/gas-tax-cut-again/" target="_blank">NextSTL</a> points out that the key source of funding &#8212; the state gas tax &#8212; keeps losing purchasing power thanks to inflation. In the above chart, he contrasts the declining inflation-adjusted tax paid by drivers with the steady drumbeat of fare hikes imposed on transit riders.</p>
<p>Missouri lawmakers are floating an array of bills to buoy highway funding, which range from the logical (but politically impossible) to the deeply irresponsible, Bose writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Doug Libla has proposed <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/16info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=22246467">SB 623</a>. It would raise the gas tax by 1.5 cents and the diesel tax by 3.5 cents, raising an estimated $80M per year. Due to the Hancock Amendment this is all the legislature can do on its own. This bill <a href="http://m.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gas-tax-hike-advances-in-senate/article_3750c797-8db5-57be-a6d5-665081bf28f0.html">passed</a> out of a Senate committee, but will likely die in the House. A higher tax for diesel is a great policy considering how much <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/16info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=22246467">more damage</a> heavy vehicles do to roads.</p>
<p>The Missouri Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association are <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-campaign-to-raise-missouri-s-tobacco-tax-could-fund/article_a69da4fe-f76e-5ec4-8018-7b2ca3faf470.html">gathering signatures</a> to raise the cigarette tax to raise money for transportation. The cigarette tax also is a fixed amount per unit thus declines over time. By passing this small tax increase they can ward off future attempts at a bigger one for children’s health care. We may find out if Missourians love their roads more than their children.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-108620"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Most intriguing is Sen Schaaf’s <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/16info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&amp;BillID=22246586">SJR 18</a>, an amendment that would raise the gas tax like Sen. Libla’s bill, but would also bequeath the supplementary system of roads (lettered roads) to counties, with some extra money. MoDOT is responsible for too many miles of roads. Many see less than 400 vehicles per day. This is the policy direction we should be heading thus it doesn’t have a chance.</p>
<p>Disturbing is Rep. Brattin’s <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billsummary.aspx?bill=HJR70&amp;year=2016&amp;code=R">HJR 70</a>, an amendment that would put MoDOT funding ahead of issuing tax credits. The highways and transportation commission would determine the “needed” funding level. An independent committee of ten appointed by the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore would evaluate the funding proposal. In other words if you’re counting on Historic Tax Credits to make the numbers work on a rehab property because MODOT subsidies have undermined the value of said property, get in line!</p>
<p>Most disturbing is a plan to take savings from <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-republicans-push-no-tax-road-funding-plan/article_68c3c5ec-9126-5504-a1b6-800b97bd59dc.html">welfare cuts to pay for roads</a>. A sure sign of our mixed up priorities would be to take welfare from children to provide welfare for cars. Anything to avoid the obvious.</p>
<p>None of these proposals address the elephant in the room- I-70 (tolls!). And none do anything to add service or provide relief to transit users.</p></blockquote>

As Chicago transportation experts have pointed out, there are some positive aspects to Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner’s plan to use public-private partnership funding to widen 25 miles of the Stevenson Expressway, aka I-55, and then manage <a href=http://chi.streetsblog.org/2016/02/22/what-if-we-converted-lanes-on-i-55-instead-of-building-new-ones/>[...]</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"John Greenfield";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7766:"<div style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Screen Shot 2016-02-22 at 3.49.23 PM" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/24858199@N00/24570295134"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1674/24570295134_5f532c9143_z.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-22 at 3.49.23 PM" width="575" height="213" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Existing lanes of Highway 101 south of San Francisco may be converted to &#8220;Optimized HOT Lanes.&#8221; Image: Google Street View</p></div>
<p>As <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2016/02/05/experts-and-advocates-weigh-in-on-rauners-proposal-to-widen-the-stevenson/" target="_blank">Chicago transportation experts have pointed out</a>, there are some positive aspects to Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner’s plan to use public-private partnership funding to widen 25 miles of the Stevenson Expressway, aka I-55, and then manage congestion on the new lanes via variable tolls. However, a much smarter approach to dealing with highway congestion <a href="http://www.streetsblog.net/2016/02/19/the-highway-project-that-could-change-traffic-management-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank">may soon be pioneered in the Bay Area</a>: Converting existing lanes to tolled lanes and using the revenue to fund transit. Illinois leaders would be wise to at least consider this strategy as an alternative to highway expansion.</p>
<p>If it’s inevitable that the Stevenson is going to be widened, it would be better for the estimated $425 million cost to be largely paid for by fees from users, rather than making all Illinois taxpayers foot the bill. And, while new lanes that aren’t tolled would likely just fill up with cars again due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand">induced demand</a>, well calibrated congestion pricing would help ensure that traffic flows smoothly in the tolled lanes. Not only would solo drivers who pay the fee benefit from this, but Pace buses and carpoolers would likely be able to use the traffic-jam-free lanes at no cost.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://chi.streetsblog.org/2016/02/17/mpc-and-active-trans-disagree-about-rauners-plan-to-widen-the-stevenson/" target="_blank">as the Active Transportation Alliance has pointed out</a>, there are some big drawbacks to the plan. Even though the new lanes will be managed, they still represent more capacity for single-occupant vehicles, which means more vehicle miles traveled, more pollution, and more traffic on surface roads leading to and from the Stevenson. In addition, making it easier to drive on the expressway will promote car-centric development patterns, which discourage walking, biking, and transit use.</p>
<p>There’s also an equity issue to building this kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_toll_lane">high-occupancy toll lane</a>. Although the express lanes would encourage bus ridership and carpooling, they are also sometimes criticized as being a perk for wealthy people who choose to drive alone, and are thus nicknamed “Lexus Lanes.” And, with Rauner’s plan, since private investors would have to be paid back for financing the construction of the new lanes, the toll revenue would already be spoken for and couldn’t be used for other local transportation needs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, California leaders are seriously considering a much more progressive proposal to convert existing lanes of a Bay Area highway to tolled lanes that prioritize buses and carpoolers, and use the revenue to fund transit. The campaign for these &#8220;<a href="http://www.transformca.org/landing-page/express-lanes" target="_blank">Optimized HOT Lanes</a>” on Highway 101 south of San Francisco was first proposed by <a href="http://www.transformca.org/" target="_blank">TransForm</a>, a regional advocacy group, in late 2013. This bold proposal is something that has never been done in the United States before.</p>
<p>In an interview posted last week by <a href="http://transitcenter.org/" target="_blank">the TransitCenter foundation</a> (a Streetsblog Chicago funder) TransForm staffers Jeff Hobson and Clarrissa Cabansagan discussed how a recent change in Caltrans’ (the state transportation department) attitude towards induced demand may help make this proposal a reality. While the state of Illinois hasn’t admitted that Rauner’s plan will result in more driving, <a href="https://www.opr.ca.gov/docs/Revised_VMT_CEQA_Guidelines_Proposal_January_20_2016.pdf" target="_blank">new state of California guidelines</a> acknowledge that induced demand is real: If you build more lanes, cars will come.</p>
<p>“Not only is the state [of California] saying that highway widening will increase driving, but that agencies should consider converting existing general purpose lanes to express lanes as mitigation,” Hobson said. “That’s huge in legitimizing TransForm’s proposal, and making it easier for agencies to consider conversions instead of widening in the future.”</p>
<p>TransForm’s audacious plan seems to have some real traction with decision makers. San Mateo County, which includes the peninsula south of San Francisco, worked with the local metropolitan planning organization on <a href="http://www.transformca.org/transform-blog-post/mtc-analysis-confirms-optimized-hot-best-choice-highway-101" target="_blank">an analysis of the plan</a>, which confirmed that the proposal would move more residents, more efficiently, while costing less than highway expansion.</p>
<p>The Bay Area plan is also more equitable than the I-55 proposal. Since the tolls from the Highway 101 express lanes wouldn’t have to be used to pay back lane construction costs, the fees paid by solo drivers could be used to improve transit. That way, the revenue would benefit transit riders of all income levels, and the increased transit use would also help make the non-tolled lanes a little less congested. As such, TransForm argues that, rather than Lexus Lanes, the plan would create &#8220;Robin Hood Lanes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Granted, it might be harder to pull off such a forward-thinking plan in the Chicago region than in the politically progressive Bay Area. It’s also true that Highway 101 in San Mateo County generally has five lanes in each direction, while the Stevenson generally has three in each direction, which might make lane conversions a tougher sell. <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/lake-shore-drive-rehab-transportation-mass-transit/Content?oid=20574101" target="_blank">An IDOT staffer recently said</a> that the idea of converting existing lanes on Chicago’s eight-lane-wide Lake Shore Drive to transit-only lanes is probably a non-starter.</p>
<p>But it would be great if Illinois leaders would at least study the possibility of converting existing lanes on I-55 as an alternative to building new ones, <a href="http://activetrans.org/blog/adding-lanes-stevenson-wont-relieve-congestion" target="_blank">something Active Trans has proposed</a>. If it was feasible to do so, converting lanes on the Stevenson would have the effect of reducing car dependency, rather than increasing it.</p>

A bill to restrict spending on biking and walking infrastructure in Tennessee has ignited &#8220;a firestorm,&#8221; as the Chattanooga Times Free Press called it.
Thousands of angry Tennesseans are urging representatives to vote against a bill from state senators Mike Carter and Todd Gardenhire that would <a href=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/02/22/attack-on-street-safety-funds-sets-off-an-uprising-in-tennessee/>[...]</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Angie Schmitt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3457:"<div id="attachment_167728" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-22-at-1.13.12-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-167728" src="http://usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-22-at-1.13.12-PM-1024x534.png" alt="A proposed state bill in Tennessee would put cyclists and pedestrians at risk.

<p>A bill to restrict spending on biking and walking infrastructure in Tennessee has ignited &#8220;a firestorm,&#8221; as the <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2016/feb/22/bicyclists-irate-over-bill-restrict-gtax-spen/351278/" target="_blank">Chattanooga Times Free Press</a> called it.</p>
<p>Thousands of angry Tennesseans are urging representatives to vote against a bill from state senators Mike Carter and Todd Gardenhire that would forbid any state gas tax revenue from being spent on bike/ped projects. A partner bill has been introduced in the Tennessee House.</p>
<p>Almost 3,000 people have signed a petition from by <a href="http://www.bikewalktn.org/sb1716_hb1650_petition" target="_blank">Bike Walk Tennessee</a> against the measure. Another 700 have signed a <a href="http://www.walkbikenashville.org/isupportfunding" target="_blank">similar one</a> circulated by Bike Walk Nashville.</p>
<p>House transportation subcommittee chair Terri Lynn Weaver told the Free Press her inbox had been deluged with opposition. And Bike Walk Tennessee&#8217;s Matt Farr called it the &#8220;largest mobilization of bike advocates in state history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy Benner, a Knoxville-based bike attorney and board member at Bike Walk Tennessee, said the measure is bad on a number of levels. &#8220;Our concern is that it prevents localized communities from doing what they want to with their roadways,&#8221; she told Streetsblog. &#8220;The way it’s currently written is going to potentially prevent projects that have already been researched and approved and the communities support and mayors have signed off on from happening.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-108598"></span></p>
<p>Chattanooga and Knoxville have complete streets ordinances that would be eviscerated if the bill becomes law. &#8220;It’s going to make the roads dangerous if communities can’t use funds to make complete streets,&#8221; Benner said, noting that a pedestrian was just killed Saturday in Knoxville.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Department of Transportation, to its credit, has opposed the measure as well, saying it could lead them to run afoul of ADA laws and jeopardize the state&#8217;s chances of receiving some federal transportation funds.</p>
<p>The bill sponsors are playing off the state&#8217;s multi-billion dollar backlog of road projects to make their case. But street safety projects aren&#8217;t causing Tennessee to fall behind on transportation infrastructure. TDOT only spends about one percent of its annual $1.8 billion budget on biking and walking.</p>
<p>The House transportation subcommittee will host a hearing on the measure March 2, according to the Free Times.</p>

<p>The mayor, a Republican, is backing a major bus rapid transit project called ART along the city&#8217;s main corridor, Central Avenue. The project was recently recommended for funding in the Obama administration&#8217;s budget proposal.</p>
<p>The added momentum for the project set off opponents, who penned an <a href="http://savert66.org/letter-to-mayor-berry-and-city-councillors/" target="_blank">open letter</a> against it. A chief complaint is that claiming space for transit on Central Avenue will slow down cars.</p>
<p>On a commercial street where traffic moves as dangerous speeds, that&#8217;s a benefit, write supporters of the project at Streetsblog Network member <a href="https://urbanabq.com/2016/02/21/defenseofart/" target="_blank">Urban ABQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://route66central.com/">Nob Hill Main Street</a> recently hired <a href="http://www.gibbsplanning.com/news-2014-1.html">Robert Gibbs Planning Group</a> to do a retail health analysis of the Nob Hill retail district and the Central corridor in that area.  When discussing problems with the corridor, the first statement from the report, <a href="https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/robert-gibbs-retail-review.pdf">linked here</a>, states that “<b>Central Avenue needs to be slowed down</b>. The noise, nuisance, and threat to safety are a major impediment.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-108594"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Other notable aspects of the report included the portion stating that “walk-ability, both as an index and as experienced by most shoppers, is poor; <b>sidewalks are narrow and cluttered, street crossing is difficult and dangerous</b>.”</p>
<p>Recommended strategies to fix these stated problems include <b>“slow Central Avenue to 25 mph”</b>and “replace parking kiosks with modern ‘smart’ parking meters at each space.”</p>
<p>Recommended structural changes from the report included <b>“wider sidewalks, more pedestrian crossings, more traffic lights, and public spaces” </b>and<b> “reduce traffic to one lane each way.”</b></p>
<p>The ART project will accomplish all of these goals.</p>
<p>Overall, ART will greatly improve the retail environment on Central Avenue.</p></blockquote>

<p>The massive, $203 million <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/wilson/" target="_blank">reconstruction of the Wilson Red Line</a> stop in the Uptown neighborhood has made impressive progress over the last few weeks. The canopies for the new platform are taking shape, as is the chunky structure of the shaft for the new elevator that will finally make the station wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>The station was built in 1923, and in recent years it had fallen into disrepair, making it a three-time winner of <a href="http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2013-08-19/news/41426234_1_addison-stop-crust-station-cta">RedEye’s “Crust Station” contest</a>. The renovation includes replacing and relocating 2,200 feet of the track, and transforming the stop into a new transfer point between the Red and Purple lines.</p>

<p>The project will also build a much roomier station house, with three entrances and plenty of sleek, modern surfaces, including a glassed-in main entrance on the south side of Wilson, with a twenty-foot-high ceiling. As a nod to the station’s history, its original façade—whose stately beaux arts clock tower was amputated more than half a century ago—will be restored to its former glory. Work began in fall 2014 and is slated for completion by fall 2017.</p>

<p>The CTA and the city’s water department are currently hustling to complete the first phase of the project by next month. The goal of phase I is to be able to run trains on the new tracks. According to a post on the neighborhood site <a href="http://www.uptownupdate.com/2016/02/construction-closures-for-this-week.html" target="_blank">Uptown Update</a>, there will be street closures for vehicular traffic on Wilson and Broadway as the CTA completes the construction of the new platform’s canopy and a sound wall, and the water department replaces a sewer line on Broadway.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to see this project take shape, since it will be a major enhancement for the community.</p>

<p>One year after some progressive civil engineers around the country <a href="http://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/03/11/engineering-establishment-sets-out-to-purge-deviant-bikeway-designs/">feared a crackdown</a> against new-fangled street and signal designs, the opposite seems to be taking place.</p>
<p>The obscure but powerful <a href="http://www.ncutcd.org/">National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a>, which has often been a drag on changes in American street design, is now moving on several fronts to bring in new blood and prepare U.S. streets for a future that&#8217;d be much friendlier to biking and walking.</p>
<p>One of its member organizations is organizing into a disciplined voting bloc in favor of better tools to improve biking and walking. A prominent organization for urbanist transportation pros, <a href="http://nacto.org">NACTO</a>, may be invited to join. And just Thursday, the Federal Highway Administration wrapped up a <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FHWA_FRDOC_0001-1260">public comment period</a> that could lead to the NCUTCD greatly accelerating updates to the design guidance it gives cities around the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most exciting time in my career,&#8221; said Dongho Chang, Seattle&#8217;s city traffic engineer and one of the NCUTCD&#8217;s new voting members this year. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re on the cusp of having that committee think much more broadly than just the highway focus.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Institute for Transportation Engineers will use its votes to support &#8216;multimodal decisions&#8217;</h2>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img id="ITE President Paula Benway" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" title="ITE President Paula Benway" src="http://peopleforbikes.org/page/-/uploads/GLP/paula%20benway%20300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="331" /><p class="wp-caption-text">ITE President Paula Benway.</p></div>
<p>The shifts have accelerated since Jan. 1, when one of the NCUTCD&#8217;s major affiliate groups, the <a href="http://www.ite.org/">Institute for Transportation Engineers</a>, inducted a new president.</p>
<p>As one of her first initiatives in office, ITE President Paula Benway began using ITE&#8217;s eight voting seats on the NCUTCD to push for change on the national committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to call it a ghost committee &#8212; nobody knew anything about it,&#8221; Benway, a longtime transportation consultant in Rochester, N.Y. who now works for Stantec in Tampa, said in an interview last week. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot of concerns, and I promised I was going to take some action to make it a little more visible, make it a little more transparent.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Benway began sticking to ITE&#8217;s previously unenforced term limits on its NCUTCD delegates. And she also gave them a new rule: Those delegates would report to ITE&#8217;s leadership regularly to make sure their voting record on NCUTCD reflects ITE goals like making streets biking- and walking-friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their decisions must be aligned to what ITE stands for,&#8221; Benway said in an interview last week. &#8220;That we&#8217;re foward-thinking. That we&#8217;re willing to experiment with new treatments, especially with multimodal decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Benway, making the NCUTCD more receptive to bike-specific facilities is personal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a cyclist myself, so I have a soft spot for multimodal facilities, and that&#8217;s what I promote in everything I do professionally,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Chang, who has <a href="https://nextcity.org/features/view/seattle-transportation-planning-complete-streets">earned a reputation</a> as one of the country&#8217;s most progressive engineers on biking and walking infrastructure, called Benway a &#8220;game changer&#8221; for ITE.</p>
<h2>Urbanist professionals&#8217; group invited to join MUTCD as voting member</h2>
<div style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://peopleforbikes.org/page/-/uploads/GLP/cheap%20curb%20extension.png" alt="" width="570" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Seattle City Traffic Engineer Dongho Chang, left, shows a low-cost curb extension to a visiting delegation from Indianapolis.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Chang was among several urbanist engineers named to an NCUTCD task force that was assigned to help the national committee solve a problem.</p>
<p>The problem: U.S. cities were rapidly importing ideas from abroad, like painted bike lanes and dedicated bike signals, before the MUTCD had had a chance to fully approve them.</p>
<p>Most people agreed that this was creating inconsistency.</p>
<p>To pick one example: Memphis was using green paint to mark the parts of bike lanes that cars might cross, while New York City was using green paint to mark the parts of bike lanes where cars can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The NCUTCD task force might have chosen to condemn cities that used new designs without permission. Instead, Chang said, it came to the conclusion that the NCUTCD needed to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the task force said was, &#8216;You&#8217;re not serving the needs of the community. You need to change this process,'&#8221; Chang said.</p>
<p>During that conversation: Chang and another urbanist engineer in the group, Peter Koonce of Portland, started pitching an idea: inviting the progressive, city-focused National Association of City Transportation Officials to become an NCUTCD member organization alongside ITE, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials and others.</p>
<p>Chang hopes that NACTO will decide to formally apply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would create a paradigm shift,&#8221; Chang said. &#8220;Having NACTO on the board saying &#8216;these are the tools that we need to have for the manuals, these are the things we need to have for the research,&#8217; they can help drive some of the agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chang said he &#8220;would think&#8221; that an organization of NACTO&#8217;s size (it has 12 staffers and hosts a <a href="http://nacto.org/designingcities2015/">significant annual conference</a>) would get the same eight seats as the NCUTCD&#8217;s founding organizations, ITE and AASHTO.</p>
<p>&#8220;If NACTO really wants to provide long-term change then being part of the committee is a huge mechanism,&#8221; Chang said. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably one of the most effective ways to get these tools to practitioners.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Federal Highway Administration weighs faster changes to crucial street manual</h2>
<div style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://peopleforbikes.org/page/-/uploads/GLP/austin%204th%20street.jpg" alt="" width="570" /><p class="wp-caption-text">4th Street, Austin, Texas: A popular protected bike lane designed without guidance from the MUTCD.</p></div>
<p>The third front of change at the NCUTCD is in the hands of the federal agency that gives the private committee its authority: the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
<p>In December, the FHWA <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FHWA_FRDOC_0001-1260">requested comments</a> about, among other things, the &#8220;frequency of MUTCD editions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Updates to the NCUTCD&#8217;s massive <a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm">Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a> are notoriously slow-moving. The text of the current edition was prepared in 2007; the next one may not be adopted at the state level until 2021.</p>
<p>Benway, Chang and others worry that that&#8217;s an eternity in the fast-evolving transportation world.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the MUTCD and say all of this stuff looks like it was written in the mid-90s, that&#8217;s because it was,&#8221; said Matthew Roe, the director of NACTO&#8217;s Designing Cities Intiative.</p>
<p>Roe said that the FHWA &#8220;definitely look like they&#8217;re fishing&#8221; for people to respond with ideas for either splitting the MUTCD into two documents, one updated more frequently than the other, or distinguishing between two types of content in the manual, with one content type updated more freuqently than the other.</p>
<p>ITE this month urged the FHWA to take the latter route, creating separate processes for updating the MUTCD&#8217;s &#8220;standards&#8221; (things like the proper color of plastic posts that separate a bike lane) and its &#8220;guidance&#8221; (things like whether it&#8217;s OK to use plastic posts to separate a bike lane).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8tOk7_upXv5QjVzazhPX3F6Ym5nZHM0WWxDa1JRODF4MHlv/view?usp=sharing">ITE&#8217;s letter</a>, Benway suggested a regular process for making small revisions to the MUTCD &#8220;every 2-3 years&#8221; in between its major updates every six to eight years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular updates will allow the MUTCD to change with time to reflect the growing number and application of traffic control devices,&#8221; Benway wrote.</p>

In almost every state, politicians beat the drum for hundreds of millions of dollars to &#8220;solve congestion&#8221; by widening highways.

<p>In almost every state, politicians beat the drum for hundreds of millions of dollars to &#8220;solve congestion&#8221; by widening highways. After spending the better part of a century doing this, we know that thanks to induced demand, soon after the asphalt sets on the new lanes, people will drive more and congestion will return. The whole exercise is a bit like a dog chasing its tail.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no real secret to managing traffic in a way that will succeed in the long run: the ingredients are better transit, better land use planning, and, perhaps most importantly, road pricing. American states and cities just haven&#8217;t put it all together.</p>
<p>One place that could make a breakthrough soon is the peninsula south of San Francisco, where Bay Area advocacy group TransForm is working to convert lanes on Highway 101 to tolled lanes. The revenue would support better transit, giving commuters an alternative to sitting in traffic.</p>
<p><a href="http://transitcenter.org/2016/02/17/transform-interview/" target="_blank">TransitCenter</a> recently interviewed TransForm&#8217;s Jeff Hobson and Clarrissa Cabansagan about their efforts and how California&#8217;s DOT (Caltrans) has helped by acknowledging that wider roads cause more traffic. Here&#8217;s what they had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Caltrans hasn’t recognized induced demand in the past?</b></p>
<p>Jeff: No &#8212; the change actually made newspaper headlines!</p>
<p>Not only is the state saying that highway widening will increase driving, but that agencies should consider converting existing general purpose lanes to express lanes as mitigation. That’s huge in legitimizing TransForm’s proposal, and making it easier for agencies to consider conversions instead of widening in the future.</p>
<p><b>That brings us to the Optimized HOT project. This idea is pretty audacious and hasn’t been done in the US before.</b></p>
<p>Jeff: We know that this a high-risk/high-reward project, and that’s exciting. If we do convince the counties to convert a general purpose lane to an express lane and use the revenues for transit, we really will have won a huge shift.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-108561"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>How’s it going?</b></p>
<p>Jeff: We put this idea out there at the end of 2013 and talked with different agencies about the possibility.  We’re so excited that San Mateo County picked up the idea, and worked with our MPO, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, on an analysis that confirmed that what we’re proposing is the <a href="http://www.transformca.org/transform-blog-post/mtc-analysis-confirms-optimized-hot-best-choice-highway-101" target="_blank">best solution</a>. It would move more people with less traffic, get done more quickly and cost less than road widening.</p>
<p>Clarrissa: This is a new way of conceiving public infrastructure &#8212; seeing the existing highway as a place for and a way to fund public transit. Even if we get Muni and BART the money they need to repair themselves and run most efficiently, they only serve some people. The highway network touches more of the region. We need to give more people more transit options, even if they run on the highway.</p></blockquote>
