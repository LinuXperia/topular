    <p>Recently, the California Supreme Court rendered an opinion in <em>Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles</em>, <em>LLC</em>.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; The facts in the case involved Mr. Iskanian who worked as a driver for CLS Transportation Los Angeles, LLC ("CLS").<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Nine months into his employment, Mr. Iskanian signed an arbitration agreement which provided that all claims arising out of his employment with CLS had to be submitted to binding arbitration.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; Additionally, the agreement contained a waiver in which Mr. Iskanian agreed not to assert class action and representative action claims against CLS in arbitration or otherwise (i.e. in court).<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; In effect, Mr. Iskanian signed away his rights to bring a class action suit against CLS.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>Notwithstanding the agreement, Mr. Iskanian filed a class action suit on August 4, 2006 against CLS, claiming that CLS "failed to pay overtime, provide meal and rest breaks, reimburse business expenses, provide accurate and complete wage statements, or pay final wages in a timely manner."<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; In reply, CLS argued that all of Mr. Iskanian's claims were subject to binding arbitration, per the arbitration agreement Mr. Iskanian had signed.<sup>7</sup></p>
    <p>On June 23, 2014, the California Supreme Court mostly agreed with CLS.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; The Court found that Mr. Iskanian could not bring a class action because the class action arbitration provision was enforceable against him.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; The Court reasoned that even if employees argue that the class action waiver is unconscionable or violates public policy, the Federal Arbitration Act's ("FAA") goal of promoting arbitration must be followed.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; <strong></strong></p> <p>However, the California Supreme Court found that Mr. Iskanian could still bring a representative action on behalf of the state of California for violations committed against himself and his fellow employees under California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 ("PAGA"), which he did.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>Under PAGA, when an employee "bring[s] an action for civil penalties... most of the proceeds of that litigation go[] to the state."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, 75 percent of the award must go to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, while the employees only receive 25 percent.<sup>13</sup></p> <p>Now, more than ever, employees should be more aware of what they are signing.&nbsp;</p> <p>_____________________________________</p> <p><sup>1</sup> Iskanian v.

    <p>The California Supreme court recently provided greater protection for undocumented workers to file a lawsuit against an unscrupulous employer, yet still risking deportation.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; In its recent decision in <em>Salas v. Sierra Chemical Co.</em> on June 25, 2014, the California Supreme Court was faced with the following set of facts.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; In 2003, Vicente Salas ("Mr. Salas") began working for Sierra Chemical Company ("Sierra") and provided a false Social Security card.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; In 2005, Mr. Salas and his coworkers each received a letter from the federal Social Security Administration stating that their names and Social Security numbers did not match.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; A Sierra manager told them not to worry about the discrepancies with the Social Security numbers.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; In 2006, Mr. Salas injured his back while working and filed a workers' compensation claim.<sup>6</sup> &nbsp;In 2007, a Sierra manager told Mr. Salas that he could not return to work if he had not fully recovered from his back injury because it would violate company policies.<sup>7</sup> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Later that year, Mr. Salas sued Sierra for failure to provide reasonable accommodations for his disability and for retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim in violation of FEHA.<sup>8</sup> &nbsp;Mr. Salas sought to recover lost wages, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney fees.<sup>9</sup> &nbsp;Sierra argued that Mr. Salas's suit was barred because he had used another person's Social Security number and card to obtain employment, exposing Sierra to penalties under federal immigration law.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; The Supreme Court disagreed.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court ruled that federal immigration "law does not prohibit an employer from paying, or an employee from receiving wages earned during employment wrongfully obtained by false documents, so long as the employer remains unaware of the employee's unauthorized status."<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;</p> <p>Further, the Court added that not allowing undocumented workers to "obtain state remedies for unlawful discharge, including prediscovery period lost wages, would effectively immunize employers that, in violation of fundamental state policy, discriminate against their workers on grounds such as disability or race, retaliate against workers who seek compensation for disabling workplace injuries, or fail to pay the wages that state law requires."<sup>13</sup></p> <p>It remains to be seen, following the <em>Salas</em> decision, whether undocumented workers who face discrimination or other labor violations will come forward, given the risks they still face.</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p><sup>1</sup> Salas v.

("Time Warner").<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Ms. Peabody sold advertising for Time Warner's various cable channels.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; Time Warner paid Ms. Peabody biweekly, based on commissions and on a base salary.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Often, Ms. Peabody worked 45 hours a week and was not paid overtime.<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;After ten months of working for Time Warner, Ms. Peabody resigned and brought a class action suit against Time Warner for violations of California's wage and overtime laws.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p> <p>Under California wage laws, the general rule is that employees who work more than eight hours in one work day or more than 40 hours in a workweek must be paid overtime.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; However, if an employee's earnings exceed one and one-half (11/2) times the minimum wage and if more than half of that employee's earnings is from commission, then the employee is said to be exempt and is not paid overtime.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; This is known as the commissioned sales exemption to overtime.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Time Warner had a system in which commissions were paid out to employees only after several conditions were met.<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; This meant that commissions were not paid in the pay period in which they were earned, but in a later pay period, once the conditions were satisfied.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp; Ms. Peabody showed that in most pay periods, she was paid only her base salary, which was a little more than minimum wage.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; Thus, Ms. Peabody argued she was not an exempt employee and was entitled to overtime.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, Time Warner maintained that Ms. Peabody was an exempt commissioned employee because commission wages were attributable to pay periods in which they were earned, and not in which they were paid.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the end, the California Supreme Court disagreed with Time Warner.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; It found that commissions could not be attributed to the pay period in which they were earned for purposes of satisfying the commissioned sales exemption.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp; An "employer may not attribute wages paid in one pay period to a prior pay period to cure a shortfall."<sup>16</sup>&nbsp; The court was clear - to be exempt, an employee must be paid at leastone and one-half (11/2) times the minimum wage in <em>every </em>pay period.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</p> <p>This ruling is important for current employees working on commission who are exempt from being paid overtime.&nbsp; Exempt employees might want to make sure they are paid at least one and one half times (11/2) the minimum</p> <p>____________________________</p> <p><sup>1</sup> Peabody v.

    <p>A former defense contractor employee in California has filed a lawsuit alleging that he lost his job because he refused to perform illegal tasks. The man, who is a retired naval officer, says that he was the victim of <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Wrongful-Termination/Retaliation.shtml" >employer retaliation</a> after he refused illegal orders from his boss at Systems Application and Technologies, Inc. The suit comes at a devastating time for the company, which has just been accused of operating a malfunctioning drone that caused $30 million in damage to Naval equipment.</p> <p>The plaintiff argues that his supervisor instructed him to work on weekends without compensation. That was just one piece of evidence that demonstrated the company's general incompetence, according to the former employee. The man was employed by SA-Tech to oversee a drone project that provided targets for aerial training at California military facilities.</p>
    <p>Shortly after the man was hired on to the project, he realized that the company was lacking materials and funding needed to complete critical operations tasks. At that time, the man's supervisor apparently refused to transfer additional money to the project. That meant that workers were denied pay for 60 days -- until a government contract could be finalized.</p> <p>Further, the man claims that he had told the company that drone operators were not properly trained or certified, and that they could pose a threat to public safety. Indeed, that proved to be the case; one of the company's out-of-control drones punched a hole in a Naval vessel and started a fire on board, wounding two sailors. That incident was blamed on a combination of human error and system failures.</p> <p>After that mishap, the man says that he was told to work over a weekend, but his supervisor instructed him to leave the hours off of his time card. Such actions are considered illegal. No matter the industry, no one should be subject to retaliatory acts for refusing to work without pay. All workers deserve fair compensation, which they may pursue in an employment lawsuit if their company does not comply.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> Courthouse News Service, "<a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/08/22/70684.htm" target="_blank">Navy Contractor Accused of Retaliatory Firing</a>" Dan McCue, Aug. 22, 2014</p>

    <p>Did you know that California workers are guaranteed certain rights at their place of employment? The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is responsible for enforcing the laws that protect employees from various types of <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/" >workplace discrimination</a>. These rules are designed to shield workers from unfair treatment and provide them with a respectful, safe working environment.</p> <p>You may be surprised at the multitude of categories that exist for employment discrimination. Workers in California are protected from unfair treatment based on their race and ethnicity, but employees' religion, health status, marital status, disabilities and sexual orientation are also considered protected categories. Further, sex discrimination is prohibited; that means that an employer cannot discriminate based on pregnancy status or requests for breastfeeding.</p>
    <p>Employers are responsible for prohibiting harassment at their work sites. Harassment should never occur against employees or those applying for employment. Further, independent contractors are shielded from workplace harassment and employment discrimination -- many states do not extend such protections. These requirements are dictated by the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and associated regulations.</p> <p>Job applicants and current employees may be entitled to file a complaint with the DFEH if they believe they have been the victims of workplace discrimination. Independent contractors may also be eligible for this action. California law provides specific remedies for those who have suffered because of legal violations. Those include remedies such as the provision of back pay, reinstatement to a former position, promotion and hiring. Employers may also be required to pay punitive damages and compensate victims for their emotional distress.</p> <p>These claims are restricted by statutes of limitations for filing, however. Complaints must be submitted to the DFEH within a year of the last instance of harassment or discrimination. For workers under the age of 18, the limit extends to a year after the victim's eighteenth birthday. Quick action on the part of the injured employee may improve the chances of recovering damages in a harassment case.</p> <p><b>Source:</b> California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, "<a href="http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/Publications/DFEH-162.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">California Law Prohibits Workplace Discrimination and Harassment</a>" Aug. 19, 2014</p>

    <p>Should you be passed up for a promotion because you took time off to care for a sick relative? Although federal mandates protect workers who need to take time off for maternity leave or an extended illness, employers do not always follow the rules. Experts in California and other states say they are seeing an upswing in the number of lawsuits that have been filed against employers who fail to comply with the <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/FMLA.shtml" >Family and Medical Leave Act</a>.</p> <p>Employees do not have to meet a massive legal standard in order to prove employment law violations related to FMLA provisions. In fact, FMLA complaints only have to prove that the employer deterred the worker from taking leave that is authorized under the legislation. Further, employers who interrupt such a leave -- by calling a worker back in during maternity leave, for example -- can also be considered violators.</p>
    <p>The uptick in FMLA lawsuits may be a direct effect of increased education about employee rights. FMLA matters are more commonly discussed in the modern workplace, so more employees are aware of their options under the act. Those employees are demanding fair treatment -- and they are winning lawsuits.</p> <p>Workers can be entitled to a significant amount of money in connection with an FMLA suit. They can recover up to double any of their wages that were lost. Additional claims can also recover damages for the cost of caring for an ill family member if leave is denied. Punitive damages are not available to workers under this law, however.</p> <p>Federal legislation protecting workers' health and welfare exists for a reason. Employers who negligently refuse to recognize family illness or personal illness as a legitimate reason to take leave should be held accountable. Workers deserve to exercise the full panel of protections provided under the FMLA.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> The Wall Street Journal, "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/more-workers-file-family-leave-lawsuits-1407515411" target="_blank">More Workers File Family-Leave Lawsuits</a>" Joe Palazzolo, Aug. 08, 2014 </p>

    <p>If you have reported an incident of workplace discrimination, you may be concerned about the backlash of emotions that could come from your supervisors or higher-ups at your company. Finding yourself in this situation can be unnerving, but it is important to understand that you have legal protections under both California and federal law. <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Wrongful-Termination/Retaliation.shtml" >Employer retaliation</a> against a whistleblower is illegal. Victims should never have to endure intimidation, threats, coercion or harassment because they have spoken out against a discriminatory practice.</p> <p>Retaliation at a California workplace occurs when three factors combine. The employer must take an adverse action against an employee, also known as a covered individual, because that person participated in a protected activity. Just what constitutes a protected activity? Legal experts say that employees should never be targeted by their supervisors for informing an employer in good faith that they believe discrimination is occurring. Everything from picketing to filing a formal complaint and refusing to obey a discriminatory order would fall into this category. Serving as a witness in a federal employment investigation is also considered a protected activity.</p>
    <p>Covered individuals in this case include those who oppose unlawful practices and have sought help for employment discrimination. Those who have a close association with the person claiming discrimination are also covered -- that includes spouses, children and others. Keep in mind that whistleblowers who have raised ethical concerns not related to discrimination are not considered protected parties.</p> <p>Finally, the employer must take adverse action against the person complaining of discrimination. These actions may include demotion, refusal to hire or termination. Threats, unfair performance reviews and increased surveillance would also fall into this category. Victims who have suffered from this type of treatment on the job after enduring discrimination deserve financial compensation for their travails. Everyone has a right to a harassment-free workplace.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, "<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/facts-retal.cfm" target="_blank">Facts About Retaliation</a>" Aug. 06, 2014 </p>

    <p>A woman who had managed a Chipotle Mexican Grill in San Luis Obispo, California, is seeking financial compensation for workplace discrimination and violations of her employee rights. The woman, who filed the lawsuit in March, accuses her former employer of race discrimination, along with hour and wage violations. Further, she claims that she was denied opportunities for advancement. The woman is African-American.</p> <p>The woman said she faced resistance at work when she lobbied for fair break times for employees. Further, she argues that she and several other employees suffered constant harassment from their former supervisor, who made discriminatory comments about her race. She also has accused that supervisor of publicly shaming her by cursing at her. That man is also said to have filled a worker's lemonade drink with salt, causing the worker to become violently ill.</p>
    <p>The woman's attorney said she approached him while she was still working at the restaurant. She was looking for help with potential hour and wage violations that were occurring at the restaurant. The woman was able to join a larger class-action lawsuit in addition to the discrimination claims -- that larger suit alleges that the restaurant chain committed wage violations by improperly classifying managers as exempt from overtime pay. The company is also accused of reporting violations with regards to employee wages, which may result in tax discrepancies, according to state and federal sources.</p> <p>No one should have to suffer such indignities when they go to do their job. Race discrimination and other types of negative treatment have no place in our modern working world. Those who have been victimized by systematic discrimination and abuse deserve financial compensation for their troubles.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> The Tribune, "<a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/07/25/3168133/chipotle-lawsuit-janeka-samuels.html" target="_blank">Ex-manager at SLO Chipotle claims discrimination, labor law violations</a>" Matt Fountain, Jul. 25, 2014 </p>

    <p>A former manager at Twitter is taking legal action against the social media company after he was allegedly fired because of his age. The man, age 57, is also accusing the company of violating <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/" >workplace discrimination</a> regulations by terminating his employment because of a physical disability. That man had been the head of data center deployment for the high-profile organization, which is based in San Francisco.</p> <p>The suit alleges that the man's supervisor made critical comments about his age. Further, documents note that Twitter staff are generally young, with few out of their 30s. The plaintiff alleges that his position was filled by several employees who were decades younger than he was. Further, he accused Twitter of pushing an unfair amount of work onto him after he became ill with kidney stones; then, the company fired him because he could not do his job.</p>
    <p>This is not the first allegation that has been fired at Twitter and other similar social media sites with regards to age discrimination. Tech companies in California and other states have found themselves in difficult legal situations after posting job listings requesting only "new graduates." One former Google worker received a multimillion-dollar settlement after he was subject to pejorative comments from his coworkers and supervisors, who called him "obsolete" and "too old to matter."</p> <p>This case is just another reminder of the dominant culture in the tech industry, which tends to discriminate not only because of age but also because of gender and ethnicity. This collegiate culture leads companies into legal hot water, but age discrimination continues to pop up throughout Silicon Valley and other areas of innovation. No one should have to lose a job simply because they are errantly thought to be "too old" to adapt to or create new technology.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> Slate, "<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/07/15/twitter_sued_for_age_discrimination_it_s_not_uncommon_in_silicon_valley.html" target="_blank">Former Twitter Employee Sues the Company for Age Discrimination</a>" Alison Griswold, Jul. 15, 2014 </p>

    <p>Workers who have become pregnant may have some extra assurance that they will get the assistance that they need, according to recent guidelines that were put out by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Similar issues will soon be seen by the U.S. Supreme Court, as well, so it is important for all workers to understand the outcomes and what they could mean for their rights. As their legal rights change or are reinforced, they must remain knowledgeable about how these things can impact them on the job.</p> <p>The guidance being given out by the EEOC is directly related to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</p>
    <p>For example, one of the big statements being made is that workers who are pregnant should be allowed to take on jobs that are considered to be "light-duty." If other workers, who are not pregnant, have this work open to them, then it should not be denied to those who are.</p> <p>This is important because it seems to go against a decision made by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which said that light duty work could be made an option for some non-pregnant workers without any requirement that the same jobs be offered for those who have become pregnant. This ruling is now going to be reviewed, per an agreement made on the first of July, by the Supreme Court.</p> <p>If employees in California ever feel that their employer has committed a <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/Disability.shtml">failure to make reasonable accommodations</a> if they are pregnant, they should know about their legal options to get the employer to comply. The outcome of this Supreme Court case will help to outline what can be done.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> Bloomberg BNA, "<a href="http://www.bna.com/eeoc-issues-new-n17179892312/" target="_blank">EEOC Issues New Enforcement Guidance on Pregnancy Bias</a>" Jul. 15, 2014 </p>

    <p>California news outlets are reporting that a former Walgreens employee who was fired for taking a package of chips during a diabetic emergency will receive an $180,000 settlement. The diabetic woman, 57, had been employed by the company for nearly 18 years when the incident occurred. She reportedly took and ate a bag of chips that cost less than $2 in order to prevent herself from experiencing a medical emergency. The company will pay for the <a href="&rdquo;http:/www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/Disability.shtml&rdquo;">disability discrimination</a>, along with the costs of lost wages and emotional distress.</p> <p>Official reports show that the woman&rsquo;s condition was known by the company. She had a serious attack of hypoglycemia during a work shift in 2008. After she started to shake and sweat, the woman grabbed and ate a bag of chips to prevent her condition from escalating. Even though she paid for the chips after recovering from the attack, Walgreens still fired her for eating food sold in the store without first paying for it. The woman has been unemployed since that time.</p>
    <p>A settlement was reached shortly before the case was slated to go to trial. The company had attempted to have the suit dismissed, but a judge determined that there was no other evidence of misdeeds that would warrant the woman being fired. In addition to paying the settlement, Walgreens has agreed to provide training for workers at its facilities about accommodating disabled employees.</p> <p>Workers who have been the targets of disability discrimination may suffer from a variety of health conditions. These victims may not always look disabled, but they still deserve protection. No one should be forced out of a job for taking emergency life-saving measures while at work.</p><p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b>Source: SF Gate,&nbsp;"<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Walgreens-to-pay-diabetic-who-needed-food-fast-5596185.php" target="_blank" >Walgreens to pay diabetic who needed food fast and was fired</a>,"&nbsp;Bob Egelko,&nbsp;July 3, 2014</p>

    <p>In a landmark employment law case, the California Supreme Court decided that undocumented immigrants should be protected from discrimination even if they illegally use other people's Social Security numbers to obtain a job.</p> <p>This significant ruling, designed to protect employees from <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Wrongful-Termination/Retaliation.shtml" >retaliatory discharge</a>, came after the high court decided that workers should be protected regardless of their immigration status. Workers are permitted to seek financial compensation for back pay up to the time when the employer discovered that the employee did not have legal status.</p> <p>A worker filed the civil suit against his former employer, arguing that he had been the victim of discrimination because of his disability. The chemical company that employed the man was able to get that workers' compensation case dismissed after it was determined that the plaintiff obtained the job with someone else's Social Security number. The court decided that the onus of responsibility for legal employment lies with the worker. That is, the employee is liable for the misdeeds that come along with fraudulently obtaining employment -- the company should still be required to pay the worker.</p>
    <p>This plaintiff's case will be sent back to a lower court because his immigration status is actually not entirely clear. Although the man used someone else's information to obtain the job, it has not been established that he is actually an illegal immigrant. This man, unlike many others, is one of the few undocumented immigrants to actually exercise his employment rights.</p> <p>Experts say that although this is a seminal ruling, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on a large number of cases.

Illegal immigrants who believe they have been the victims of employer retaliation or wrongful termination may be entitled to damages because of their experiences.</p><p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b>Los Angeles Times, "<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-job-protections-illegal-immigrants-20140626-story.html" target="_blank">Job protections extend to immigrants using false ID, court rules</a>," June 26, 2014.</p>

    <p>California is one of just a small number of states to provide official workplace discrimination protection for employees who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. A new executive order from President Obama could cause such protections to become more widespread, however, providing additional support to those who are suffering <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/" >workplace discrimination</a> because of their sexual orientation. The federal executive order would require contractors that provide services to the government to bar discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.</p> <p>Federal workers already enjoy this particular type of protection, though workers in other industries are generally left out in the cold. A minority of U.S. states -- California among them -- offer protections for LGBT workers. Even though California has its own state mandates, experts say that the federal order could actually bolster protections for LGBT workers. The executive order would add another barrier to discrimination and limit the amount of taxpayer money that is spent on contractors with discriminatory hiring and working practices.</p>
    <p>Legal gurus say that existing laws provide an important framework for ending hostile work environments perpetrated against LGBT workers. However, employers are not always held responsible for actually following those laws. This is evidenced in the fact that about one in five LGBT employees reports unfair workplace discrimination because of their sexual orientation.</p> <p>No worker should have to suffer through the shame and embarrassment of workplace discrimination because of his or her gender identity or sexual orientation. These employees deserve the same type of fair treatment that is provided for protected groups of various racial compositions. Workers who have been victimized by this type of discrimination in California may be eligible for legal redress, including financial damages for workplace complaints.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> The Sun, "<a href="http://www.sbsun.com/social-affairs/20140621/executive-order-could-bolster-california-lgbt-worker-protections" target="_blank">Executive order could bolster California LGBT worker protections</a>" Brenda Gazzar, Los Angeles Daily News, Jun. 21, 2014 </p>

    <p>A Disney worker who had spent 22 years at the company is alleging age discrimination in a wrongful termination suit. The man, who lost his job in 2013, has filed the suit in California, arguing that Disney has a troubling pattern of systematic <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/" >workplace discrimination</a>. In many instances, older workers have been intentionally terminated so that younger workers could take their place, saving the company money because of lower salaries.</p> <p>The plaintiff in this case says that he was told that his job position was eliminated because Disney was simply making fewer movies. There has not been any evidence to support that claim. Instead, the man says that he was replaced by his boss's assistant, who is only in her 20s or 30s. The man's job was even posted electronically after his departure. When he tried to apply, he was told that the position was already filled.</p>
    <p>The man says that his case is strengthened by the fact that another story department employee, age 69, was dismissed just seven months after his own termination. The victim was first hired in 1987, gaining full-time status in 1998. He became the head of the story department in 2005, where he consistently received positive performance reviews. A letter to the chairman of Walt Disney Studios resulted in a dismissive response; the executive said he was "impressed" with the man's dedication to Disney, but he never offered to meet with the terminated worker.</p> <p>The fact remains that although gender and race discrimination have received a lot of attention in recent years, age discrimination is far more subtle and insidious. Workers who believe they have been fired simply to save their employers money have a right to be financially compensated for the wrongful termination. These plaintiffs may be able to recover damages for distress and discomfort, emotional pain and a variety of other civil complaints against their employers.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> The Hollywood Reporter, "<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-age-discrimination-by-711235" target="_blank">Disney Sued for Age Discrimination by Former Story Department</a>" Alex Ben Block, Jun. 11, 2014 </p>

    <p>A security guard in California is claiming that he was fired from his job because he was prescribed tinted glasses by his physician. The plaintiff is seeking compensation for <a href="http://www.nosratilaw.com/Discrimination/Disability.shtml" >disability discrimination</a> from his former employers, Securitas Services and Kaiser Permanente International. The man was dismissed from his position because of his disability in February.</p> <p>Official reports show that the man was hired in December 2010 as a security guard at the hospital's San Rafael facility. He had been diagnosed with photosensitivity, so he was required to wear tinted lenses in his glasses both inside and outside. Even though the man says he submitted appropriate documentation to his supervisor at the security company, his bosses still discriminated against him.</p>
    <p>The man said that he was told several times to take off his tinted glasses. Further, he was transferred to the "graveyard" shift, being forced to work the midnight to 8 a.m. shift because hospital workers found his glasses unnerving. The man was mocked by his coworkers, which caused him serious emotional distress, ultimately manifesting in migraines and crippling anxiety.</p> <p>Supervisors at both Securitas and Kaiser told the man that he was only allowed to work the nighttime shift because of his tinted glasses. Further, even though the man had specialized training that allowed him to work in the emergency department at a higher rate of pay, he was demoted to a regular security position because of the glasses.</p> <p>Something as simple as prescribed tinted glasses seems unobtrusive -- but this man suffered serious professional issues because of his disability. The American Disabilities Act protects such workers from unfair termination and unequal treatment. No California workers should have to tolerate this type of disability discrimination at their job. Financial relief may be available through the civil courts for victims of such violations.</p> <p> <b>Source:&nbsp;</b> Courthouse News Service, "<a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/06/05/68463.htm" target="_blank">Kaiser Demoted Guard for Disability, He Says</a>" Barbara Wallace, Jun. 05, 2014 </p>
