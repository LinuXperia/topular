 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px">Many jazz greats played in Madam Walker Theater on Indiana Avenue.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you hear someone talk about the history of jazz, your first thought might be New Orleans.</p>
<p>But did you know Indianapolis had its own famous &nbsp;jazz scene starting in 1821 and lasting until the 1970s?</p>
<p>Indiana Avenue in downtown Indy was home to Madam Walker Theatre and several nightclubs where many local jazz musicians such as Wes Montgomery, J.J. Johnson, Freddie Hubbard, David Baker and Slide Hampton and songwriters Leroy Carr and Nobel Sissle went on to become some of the country's most influential jazz artists.</p>
<p>In &nbsp;the years before and after World War I, local black jazz artists weren't recorded due to the color of their skin. Only upper and middle class, white musicians were allowed. Despite this, many black artists continued to leave a lasting impact on the local community and paved the way for the next jazz generation of the 1950s</p>
<dl class="image-right captioned">
<dt><a rel="lightbox" href="/WesMontgomery.jpg"><img src="http://www.indianahistory.org/WesMontgomery.jpg/image_preview" alt="Wes Montgomery" title="Wes Montgomery" height="400" width="349" /></a></dt>
 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:349px">Wes Montgomery</dd>
</dl>

<p> and 1960s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the earlier greats was Nobel Sissle. Born in Indianapolis in 1889, the singer/songwriter teamed up with Eubie Blake to produce and perform the Broadway musical <em>Shuffle Along </em>in 1921. Sissle also played at the Indiana Roof Ballroom throughout the 1930s. In 1937, he helped found the Negro Actors Guild and served as its first president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sissle and other artists helped make way for the next generation of black musicians such as Wes Montgomery and Freddie Hubbard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Montgomery, &nbsp;nationally known as one of the greatest jazz guitarists, was born in Indianapolis in 1923. He was a self-taught musician and played in nightclubs along Indiana Avenue with his brothers and Indianapolis-born trumpeter Hubbard in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, the group recorded several songs for the label Pacific Jazz.</p>
<p>After playing with the greats on Indiana Avenue, Hubbard moved to New York and became internationally known touring across America and Europe.</p>
<p>So the next time you hear someone talking about how jazz was invented in New Orleans, you can school them on some of the greats to come out of the Hoosier State.</p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="/blog/uploads/Album%20Cover.jpg/image_preview" alt="Album Cover" height="360" width="270" />Couldn't make it to New York Fashion Week and Paris Fashion Week is just too far away? Here's a sneak peek, à la 1937.</p>
<p>A perk of working at Indiana Historical Society is that sometimes I get a sneak peek of what's new in the collection. This time it's really new to us. This Janaléne Fashion Album came to us through the mail today. It hasn't even been processed yet! I just love that old book smell.</p>
<p>I'm no fashion aficionado, but looking at all the designs and fabric swatches has given me a real yearn for a time machine to take me back to 1937 just so I can get a few of these fabulous frocks.</p>
<p>Side note: I'll keep my 21st-century ability to wear jeans and sweatshirts and comfy shoes.<img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/2016-02-12%2015.06.05.jpg/image_preview" alt="Dress Collage" /></p>
<p>Janaléne was a dress company based in Indianapolis, but past that I know very little about it. From the end of the album, I know that it was sent to a sales representative – this album likely was sent to a representative in New York state – who took a customer's order and deposit and then sent the order to the Indianapolis office. From there, the dress was sent directly to the customer who paid at time of delivery. I wonder if they had Prime shipping?</p>

<p>It's Black History Month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The month we learn and celebrate the achievements of black Americans. Here at the History Center, students and teachers can research the Hoosier ties &nbsp;of one of the most famous black female business owners – Madam C.J. Walker. While Walker wasn't born in Indiana, she is a notable Hoosier who created her cosmetic empire in Indianapolis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walker was born Sarah Breedlove on Dec. 23, 1867 to newly freed slaves - Owen and Minerva Breedlove, on a cotton plantation in Delta, La. She was the first in her family to be free-born. Her parents died when she was 7 years old, and she went to live with her sister. In 1900, due to stress and poor diet, she began to lose her hair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This led her to creating her own special formula that she would sell as shampoos and ointments from her company, Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Co., named after her husband, Charles Joseph Walker. In 1910, Walker moved to Indianapolis and set up a laboratory and beauty school.</p>
<p>Walker encouraged other black women to become successful in business and used her beauty school to teach the "Walker Beauty Method." She was an advocate for education and was involved with and donated to many African-American charities in Indianapolis, including Flanner House, Alpha Home, the Senate Avenue YMCA and Bethel AME church. In 1915, she began a lawsuit to protest discrimination at a theater in Indianapolis. She died in 1919 at the age of 51.</p>
<p>Walker's associate and close friend Freeman B. Ransom was her longtime business manager and attorney of Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Co. Ransom handled the day-to-day operations and finances of the company while Walker was away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ransom got his start with Walker's company early on. He boarded in Walker's house when she first arrived in Indianapolis and was one of the lawyers who helped Walker file incorporation papers and other legal work. Ransom continued to stay with the company until his death in 1947 when his son, Willard, known as Mike, took over.</p>
<p>Our newest collection is the Ransom Family Papers which include business, civic and limited personal materials of Freeman and Mike Ransom. This collection, along with the Walker Papers, provide excellent research on Madam C.J. Walker.</p>

<p>Ah, campaign season. The Iowa Caucuses are over and New Hampshire is just around the corner. But so often, the campaigns just feel as if they're all talk and bumper stickers and hats – lots of hats.</p>
<p>But recently, flipping through the pages of <em>The Indiana Book of Trivia</em>, I came across this fun bit of information. Part of Benjamin Harrison's 1888 presidential campaign slogan was "Roll along. Roll away. Keep the ball in motion." No, he didn't send campaign donors buggy stickers or straw hats with that written on them. There was no hashtag or Twitter handle. Instead, he had a giant metal-framed campaign ball twice a man's height with this and other slogans written on it that supporters rolled along the National Road from Maryland to the Harrison home in Indianapolis. Newspapers of the day indicate that it had a 14-foot diameter and was "greatly applauded as it rolled along."</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I'd volunteer to be part of the team responsible for transport. Can you just imagine watching the ball roll by like tweets and updates in your Twitter and Facebook feeds?</p>

<p>And, since there is nothing new under the sun, Benjamin Harrison's campaign gimmick was a riff on his grandfather's campaign for president in 1841. William Henry Harrison was Indiana's first territorial governor and served as president of the United States for a mere 32 days before succumbing to pneumonia. The phrase "Keep the ball rolling" supposedly stems from his campaign in which 6-foot paper balls were rolled from town to town.</p>
<p>As campaigning goes on – and on – and we yearn for the days of a more refined political discourse, let's just remember there have always been quirky gimmicks that will entertain generations to come.</p>
<p>Roll on.</p>

<p>Have you ever browsed through the Digital Image Collection and wondered – who scans all of these images? Well, I am one of them!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been scanning panoramic photographs and negatives from several collections housed at IHS since July 2015. So far, I have completed about 500 scans. Most of these images date from the early 20th century and were taken by a <img class="image-left" src="/Scanning%20Panoramic.jpg/image_mini" alt="Scanning Panoramic" height="168" width="224" />Cirkut (rotating panoramic) camera. Due to the length of these images, some are up to 5 feet long, I had to scan them in sections and stitch them back together using Photoshop. Each scan covers about 10 inches wide, so for a 40-inch panoramic, I scanned the image in four sections. Once I had my sections, I used Photoshop and several different tools to stitch the pieces back together. When the image was complete, I cropped, rotated, inverted and/or fixed the levels. I enjoyed scanning every panoramic because each one has a different story and a glimpse into Indiana's past. Whether it was a cityscape of Monument Circle or a World War I military group portrait, each image relates to a city, event, individual or group in Indiana's history. I have seen the evolution of clothing styles, architecture, landscapes, as well as the occasional U.S. President – Taft and Truman – represented.</p>

<p>Since I was raised in Terre Haute, I enjoyed scanning anything related to the city, parks and places I have seen my entire life. As a University of Indianapolis alum, I also felt a connection to the students and faculty seen in this photograph from the 1930s. Even though it was called Indiana Central College back then, the Good Hall building still stands with its large white columns. I can't help but think I walked those same building and grounds as the people in this photograph. I encourage you to look through images found in our<a class="external-link" href="http://images.indianahistory.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/dc013"> Digital Image Collection</a> and see if there are any places or people you recognize!</p>
<p><em>The Panoramic Photograph Digitization Project is supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services under the provisions of the Library Services and Technology Act, administered by the Indiana State Library. Project results will also be included in Indiana Memory and the Digital Public Library of America.</em></p>

<p>If you clicked on this blog post thinking I was going to write about Tommy Wiseau’s cult classic film, <em>The Room</em>, then you are sadly mistaken. If you came here to learn about the room used for You Are There 1816:<em> Indiana Joins the Nation</em>, then you have come to the right place. Sorry, Tommy.</p>
<img class="image-left" src="/1816%20The%20Room%20-%20Construction.jpg/image_preview" alt="1816 The Room - Construction" height="201" width="294" />One of the hallmarks of our You Are There exhibits is the physical recreation of a moment in time. We want visitors to feel as though they are stepping into the past, not just another room in a museum. The IHS Exhibitions and Museum Theater departments work together to capture the physicality of the historical situation we are trying to recreate. My job allows me to research the spaces and buy all of the necessary props and furniture.&nbsp;
<p><br />The 1816 constitutional convention room provided some fun challenges. For example, there is no image of the room where the convention was written. I found in my research that the delegates met in a repurposed home because of an unfinished capitol, but what did that look like? My coworkers and I read up on typical 1816 architecture, decor and furniture. We knew the delegates would not have met in a primitive cabin, but they would not have met in a palatial home, either. Instead, we set the convention in a standard-looking room with some ornamentation, but overall very basic in appearance. To signal the fact that the delegates met in what used to be a home, we included a built-in bookshelf, a large window and a modest fireplace.<img class="image-right" src="/IHS_1816_20.jpg/image_preview" alt="1816 The Room - MorganChris" height="217" width="306" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Prop shopping came next. This is always one of my favorite parts of the process. The delegates met in the room to discuss parts of the constitution, so that meant we needed to have desks and chairs. I acquired most pieces from various sellers on eBay, although my favorite desk – Jonathan Jennings’s desk – came from a wonderful booth at Midland Arts &amp; Antique Market in downtown Indianapolis. As for the smaller items, we purchased a bevy of quill pens, inkwells and real ink. I also wanted to have real books on the bookshelves, so I made a list of writers who were very important to early American political thought. Additionally, the Indiana delegates borrowed ideas from several constitutions already written. Fittingly, our room has copies of the 1799 Kentucky and 1803 Ohio constitutions. These are only a few of the categories of props in the exhibit space. You will have to go to the exhibit to see the rest. Overall, the 1816 space is not as packed full of items as our other exhibits. That was intentional. This was not a permanent location for government in Corydon, and the delegates were not going to be there for long. They simply did not need as much stuff.</p>
<p>I hope you have enjoyed this little glimpse of our exhibit development process. Come to You Are There 1816:<em> Indiana Joins the Nation</em> to see the room. More importantly, come and see how our actors portraying the constitution’s delegates bring the space to life.</p>

<p>On Monday, Jan. 18, the History Center – along with our sponsor, HealthNet – is offering&nbsp; free admission, performances, programs and service opportunities in celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>In remembrance of the leader of the Civil Rights Movement, I thought it fitting to take a minute to remember King's connection to the Hoosier state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>King was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Ga. He was thrust into the national spotlight after he led the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. His peaceful protests and advocating for the equal treatment of all Americans led him to becoming one of the most notable leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. King traveled throughout the country and visited Indiana many times. His most famous visit was in Indianapolis on Dec. 12, 1958. King came to speak at the Senate Avenue Young Men's Christian Association's Monster Meeting. The meeting was to be held at the north side YMCA, but due to King's popularity, a large turnout was expected and the meeting was moved to Cadle Tabernacle, formerly located downtown. More than 4,000 people attended the speech.&nbsp;</p>

 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px">YMCA Group  with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Dec. 12, 1958. </dd>
</dl>

<p>On April 4, 1968, King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn. Less than 500 miles away, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was about to give a campaign speech to a large group in Indianapolis. Kennedy announced the tragic news and called for peace instead of hatred. After news broke across the nation of King's death, riots erupted in every major city of the United States. All, but Indianapolis. Many attribute the peaceful demonstrations in Indianapolis after King's death to Kennedy's words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about King and his ties with Indiana, guests may visit the William H. Smith Memorial Library on Monday, Jan 18. &nbsp;Wilma L. Moore, IHS senior archivist on African-American History, will be discussing &nbsp;King and explain how the IHS collections help tell the history of Indiana's black communities.</p>

<p><em><img class="image-left" src="/Mapping%20Indiana.jpg/image_preview" alt="Mapping" />Mapping Indiana: Five Centuries of Treasures from the Indiana Historical Society</em> is the most recent publication from IHS Press and is endorsed by the Indiana Bicentennial Commission. It is a 10-pound, 320-page, hand-stitched, full-color marriage of information and beauty. Forgive the flight of fancy, but this is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever seen. I’m not naturally a cartophile – or map lover – but this book may have changed that. Each of the more than 100 maps is accompanied by an explanatory essay and many include enhanced views focusing on different parts of the map.</p>
<p>Below is a brief Q&amp;A with two of the coauthors, Eric Mundell and Amy Vedra. Mundell is the director of collections management and Vedra is the director of reference services at the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
<h3>How did the idea for the book come about?</h3>
<p><strong>EM </strong>and <strong>AV</strong>: The seed was planted in the 1990s and was the brainchild of former library staff. At that point in time, very few of the maps were cataloged and access was chiefly coordinated with the curator. Since the Indiana Historical Society has a long history of publishing, I believe it was a natural evolution in thought that a book could highlight the collection nicely and be an attribute to IHS and to its mission.</p>
<h3>Are the maps in the book the entirety of IHS’s map holdings? &nbsp;If not, how did you choose?</h3>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: By no means. The book represents less than ten percent of the total map holdings of the William Henry Smith Memorial Library. Selection was arduous. Following a core set of criteria, a pan-institutional committee was assembled for initial selection among a broad spectrum of subject material. The co-authors were then charged with refining or enhancing coverage topically in specific areas. Other additions were made, organically, as the project evolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AV</strong>: IHS has more than 1,700 cataloged maps in its collection. With just over 100 maps highlighted, it was definitely difficult to choose what maps to include and unfortunately that means many gems in the collection had to be passed over. However, those that didn't make the cut are available for viewing by library patrons.</p>

 <dd class="image-caption" style="width:400px">The Munster map is the oldest map in IHS's map collection.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>What is the oldest map in the collection or book?</h3>
<p><strong>EM</strong> and <strong>AV</strong>: To our knowledge, the oldest map is Sebastian Münster's Die neüwen Inseln, so hinder Hispanien gegen Orient, bey dem Landt Indie ligen, being the earliest known separate map of the Americas. It dates as early as 1540 or as late as 1578. We also have a large number of maps appearing in the 11-volume atlas set produced by Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1662. It is a truly amazing source. [<em>Geographia, quae est cosmographiae Blavianae pars prima (-quinta) qua orbis terrae tabulis ante oculos ponitur et descriptionibus illustratur</em>, 1662.]&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is your personal favorite map and &nbsp; why?</h3>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: I favor the specialty maps and those depicting the American colonies and the Early Republic. Italian cartographers, like Vicenzo Coronelli and Antonio Zatta, were especially adept with their artistry and intriguing detail. Picking a favorite often presents me with a "Sofie's Choice" sort of scenario. If I had to choose, it probably would be Thomas Hutchins’s <em>Carte des environs du Fort Pitt et de la Nouvelle Province Indiana : dediée a M. Franklin </em>[1778], with the rationale that it likely shows us the first documented use of the name Indiana on a published map. That reference was to a large plot of</p>

<p>land now in West Virginia that had little to do with the Hoosier state. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AV</strong>: The Münster map, as we call it, is my favorite map for many reasons. It is widely believed to be the first representation of the North and South American continents connected by a land bridge. It is also likely the oldest printed item in our collections, dating between 1540 and 1578. Plus getting to see 16th-century paper is just cool, and, to top it all off, it's in great condition for something that is more than 400 years old!</p>
<h3>How long did this project take – writing, researching, editing, designing, etc.?</h3>
<p><strong>EM</strong>: The project saw many starts and stops through the years. It was reinvigorated with a second impetus in 2006 and 2007. &nbsp;The research, documentation, writing and initial editing phase was steady through February 2009, when all written work was submitted, and then the team of editors from the Press took over. Design probably encompassed another six months after that. With the ups and downs of progress and scheduling over time, we tend to say that book was over a decade in the making.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AV</strong>: Maps and essays were chosen and begun as early as 2006, though much more thought and work went into the project before it officially began. With a few pauses for a variety of reasons, this work was a labor of love for more than a decade!</p>

<p>The first round of our <a title="Heritage Support Grants" class="internal-link" href="/our-services/local-history-services/heritage-support-grants/heritage-support-grants">Heritage Support Grants</a> is underway, and we've been thinking about what elements go into a successful proposal. Here are some tips from the coaches and grant management team.</p>
<ul><li>Make sure your outcomes match the funding priorities, and watch out for mission creep. Don't try to create programs that aren't part of your strategic plan or aren't clearly within your mission just to chase a grant. Balance objective data and facts with subjective information that tells a story and creates an emotional feeling about the need.<br /><em>- Jamie Simek, Fundraising Educator (IHS Local History Services)</em></li><li>Find the balance. Take on a project that shows that your organization is pushing itself, but not something so big a granter will worry about the ability to finish within the grant period.<br /><em>- Karen Depauw, Grant Coach (Coordinator, IHS Local History Services)</em></li><li>Compile key organizational records before starting a grant application as a way to avoid the irritation of digging through papers at every step of the process, and store them in a safe and accessible place. Potential items could be the organization's 501(c)(3) determination letter, articles of incorporation, bylaws, budget, mission statement, strategic plan, visitation data and survey data.<br /><em>- Alan Rowe, Grant Coach (Local History Partners Coordinator, IHS Local History Services)</em></li><li>Be sure that your organizational budget has a specific line for the project. Funders want to see that you have thought about how you are going to track and report project-related income and expenses.<br /><em>- Tamara Hemmerlein, Grant Coach (Director, IHS Local History Services)</em></li><li>Make sure the need vs. solution argument is compatible. The solution may be valid, but it may not fit best with the identified need and vice versa. Proofread, but take it one step further and have someone who doesn’t know anything about the project look over your application. Reviewers will have no prior knowledge about your organization or project.<br /><em>- Curt Barsic, Grant Manager (Development Associate, IHS)</em></li><li>Save your draft early and often, and submit your application early. That way, if there are any technology issues, there’s time to rectify the situation.<br /><em>- Marianne Sheline, Grant Coach (Programs Specialist, IHS Public Programs)</em></li><li>Remember that you are telling a story. Think about your application as a "pitch" to someone who doesn't know anything about your project. Consider how you will explain who you are, what the project is and why it is necessary, all while getting them excited to be a part of it.&nbsp;<br /><em>- Jeannette Rooney, Grant Coach (Assistant Director, IHS Local History Services)</em></li></ul>

<p>Last summer, reference head Amy Vedra and my predecessor, Alyssa Boge, 
asked collections staff to share some of their favorite things currently
 held in the collections of the Indiana Historical Society. Eleven items were then selected to go on display in the library, along with
 explanations of the objects’ distinctiveness. Library patrons and 
staff were then asked to vote for the object (and the argument) that 
they preferred, thus determining the <em>favorite</em> “favorite thing” 
of our collection. The items went on display in mid-September, and 
voting ended last week. During that time, I took up Alyssa’s position 
of collections assistant in Reference Services and proudly inherited 
the library exhibits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friends, I am happy to announce that I have the results of this 
collections referendum experiment. Yes, the body politic has spoken, 
and they have selected VP of Library and Archives Suzanne Hahn’s “favorite 
thing,” a 1918 Bretzman photograph depicting a woman handing an orange 
to a doughboy headed overseas. As described by Suzanne, the photo 
“simply, but yet beautifully, captures a moment of kindness in what was a
 turbulent time in our history.” The photograph received a staggering 
20 percent of votes, edging out a fascinating Civil War diary selected by our 
cataloger, Lindsay Borman. Thank you to all participants and good luck 
in next year’s contest. I know that I am eager to enter my "horse" in 
the 2016 Favorite Things Derby.</p>
<p>Currently in the library, you can see exhibits about the Civil 
Rights Movement and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Indianapolis, and a 
new exhibit which highlights some lesser-known, but no less inspiring, 
black citizens from the early 20th century who rose above the 
expectations of a society arranged to keep them down. &nbsp;I hope that you 
will stop by the library soon to take a look, and I look forward to 
using the great collection here at the Indiana Historical Society to 
prepare some exciting new exhibits in the future. Watch this space for 
details!</p>

<p>From scrambling over avalanche-choked passes in Tibet to track down a source to meticulously tracking down mismanaged U.S. government development aid in Afghanistan, journalist and author Douglas A. Wissing has done whatever it has taken to write his stories.</p>
<p>The Bloomington, Indiana, author has, however, also discovered much to write about in his home state of Indiana. The results of his efforts are included in a new collection of his articles,<img class="image-right" src="/978-0-253-01904-2%20INWriting_W16_cover_revised.jpg/image_preview" alt="Wissing Book Cover" /> <em>IN Writing: Uncovering the Unexpected Hoosier State</em>, recently copublished by IHS Press and Indiana University Press.</p>
<p>The book captures in all its glory: sacred and profane; saints and sinners; war and peace; small towns and big cities; art, architecture, poetry and victuals. It’s about Hoosier talent and Hoosier genius: the courageous farmer-soldiers who ardently try to win the hearts and minds of 21st century Afghan insurgents; the artisans whose work pulses with the aesthetics of far-away homelands; and the famous modernist poet who had to leave to make his mark.</p>
<p>Wissing took some time to answer some questions about his book, and his writing process.</p>
<h3>How did you first get interested in writing?</h3>
<p>I grew up a couple of blocks from the Carnegie Library in Vincennes, Indiana, and after about the age of six it became my destination of choice. It was in the golden era of newspaper journalism, and there were three different papers at our house each day, including the then-superlative Louisville Courier-Journal. There were stacks of books and magazines around the house. Being a voracious reader inevitably led me to want to spin some of those entrancing and world-spanning stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What draws your attention to a story?</h3>
<p>It feels wildly idiosyncratic. After reading a short article on a street corner in Mexico about a team of U.S. farmer-soldiers in Afghanistan, I ended up covering the failed counterinsurgency for five years, embedding with American troops (including some courageous Indiana National Guard teams) in some of the most violent warzones. That chance reading resulted in my books, Funding the Enemy: How U.S. Taxpayers Bankroll the Taliban and the upcoming <img class="image-left" src="/DWissingAfghan.jpg/image_preview" alt="Courtesy Indiana National Guard, Agribusiness Development Team" height="261" width="344" /><em>Hopeless but Optimistic: Journeying through America’s Endless War in Afghanistan</em>. I got the idea for Pioneer in Tibet, my biography of the renowned explorer of Tibet, Hoosier-born Doctor Albert Shelton, from a book of old photos. I get ideas from conversations, books, and ideas pitched to me by editors. You got any good ideas?</p>
<h3>Do you have a place where you do your writing? What is your routine like?</h3>
<p>Most often I write at my old wooden harvest table in my kitchen in Bloomington’s Prospect Hill neighborhood. Good light streams in and birds bicker at the feeders. Penelope the cat wants out. I have an office but never manage to get everything over there to write. So a book and all its material inevitably overwhelms my little 1860s Greek Revival cottage. It’s celebration after a manuscript is complete. My kitchen table is liberated from piles of books and research, and I can invite friends over for dinner.</p>
<h3>What is it about Indiana that has caused you to produce so many stories about the state?</h3>
<p>I’m as Hoosier as you get. My mother’s family descended from French fur traders who came to Vincennes in the 18th century. My father’s forebears were Alsatians, who came to Indiana in the 1850s with the great wave of German auswanderer immigrants. Ancestor John Ebner was a French Foreign Legionaire, so my wanderlust is in the DNA. Ebner was a pioneer Hoosier brewer in Vincennes, which informed my book <em>Indiana: One Pint at a Time </em>that covered both Indiana’s rich brewing history and the state’s astounding craft-beer renaissance. <br />But from the time I was a boy, I also understood the state’s extraordinary and unexpected connections to the wider world. I find Hoosiers in the most remarkable places: deep in the Himalayas, in bastions in Afghanistan, and in teeming cities across the globe. We just get around, and seem to make friends wherever we go.</p>
<h3>Is there a subject or person that interests you that you have not yet written about?</h3>
<p>Oh my goodness – way too many projects and not nearly enough time. I’m interested in the Hoosier origins of the Symbionese Liberation Army; a book on the privatized U.S. prison system; French perspectives on George Rogers Clark’s campaign in what became the Northwest Territory; and articles on Azerbaijan, Guatemala and Borneo, where I researched this year; a novel set in the Kennedy era, titled, <em>Paper Boy and Ice Man</em>. That’s just the files I see around me. No end to interesting subjects.</p>
<h3>What is your next writing project?</h3>
<p>Indiana University Press will be publishing Hopeless but Optimistic: Journeying through America’s Endless War in Afghanistan in spring 2016. The book recounts my last research trip through the insurgency-wracked battle spaces of Afghanistan. It’s a picaresque narrative of a war gone horribly wrong. So this winter I’ll be minding my punctuation and tenses as the proofs go back and forth.</p>

<p><img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/Seal.jpg/image_preview" alt="Bicentennial seal" />IHS has been preparing for the State Bicentennial for years, and we can't wait to show off our new offerings – books, events, programs and special exhibits commemorating our great state. They are designed to reach every Hoosier, whether a fourth grader touring You Are There 1816:<em> Indiana Joins the Nation </em>or a book lover reading <em>Mapping Indiana: Five Centuries of Treasures from the Indiana Historical Society, </em>an outstanding and beautiful piece. The book comes alive in an exhibit opening at the History Center Jan. 16.</p>
<p>There are many other Bicentennial books coming your way from the IHS Press, including<em> Indiana’s 200: The People Who Shaped The Hoosier State</em> – just hot off the presses. <em>Road Trip</em> highlights the best places to see in Indiana and <em>House of the Singing Winds</em> is about the art of Hoosier T.C. Steele – all coming soon.</p>
<p>IHS is also sponsoring the Indiana Bicentennial Minute – 52 spots narrated by Indiana Living Legend Jane Pauley that will air each week on WISH-TV and on stations in Fort Wayne, Terre Haute, South Bend, Evansville and Lafayette. Each minute will bring you a fascinating story from our state’s past. Here's a<a class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMnEqErFcL8"> sneak peek</a> at the first one.</p>
<p>The Indiana Bicentennial Train will be at the Indiana State Fair again this year, and we are continuing our series of Bicentennial Teacher Training Workshops featuring<em> Hoosiers and the American Story</em>, our new textbook for grades eight through 12. We're also training teachers to use <a class="external-link" href="http://www.destination-indiana.com">www.destination-indiana.com</a>, an online version of one of our popular <em>Indiana Experience </em>exhibitions.</p>
<p>In the Library and Archives, we are creating the Centennial Celebration Collection, a digital image collection highlighting the celebration of Indiana’s first 100 years.</p>
<p>We are pleased to offer Heritage Support Grants – $2.5 million to local history organizations – thanks to Lilly Endowment Inc.</p>
<p>We encourage you to visit You Are There 1816:<em> Indiana Joins the Nation </em>at the History Center and debate with the delegates who wrote the first state constitution. Soon, we'll open Destination Indiana 2.0, a new look for our personal stations with new journeys, including journeys about the 1816 and 1851 constitutions.</p>
<p>Also opening at the History Center this year are You Are There 1948: <em>Communities Can!,</em> a look at life in post-World War II in Indiana, especially when it comes to food; You Are There 1877: <em>Eli Lilly at the Beginning,</em> offering a look inside Col. Lilly's original lab; and<em> Indiana Impressions: The Art of T.C. Steele,</em> featuring 43 of his paintings under one roof.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, Indiana!<br />___________________________</p>

<p>Part of the Indiana Historical Society’s commemoration of the nineteenth state’s bicentennial, <em>Indiana’s 200: The People Who Shaped the Hoosier State</em> recognizes the people who made enduring contributions to the state of Indiana in its 200-year history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Written by historians, scholars, biographers and independent researchers, the biographical essays in this book will enhance the public’s knowledge and appreciation of those who made a difference in the lives of Hoosiers, the country and even the world.</p>
<p>The editors, Linda C. Gugin and James E. St. Clair, took some time to answer questions about the book. They will sign copies at the annual Holiday Author Fair from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 5.</p>
<h3 class="subheadBlue"><strong>How did you get involved with the <em>Indiana’s 200</em> book project?</strong></h3>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<p>We were asked to take on this project by Indiana Historical Society Press editors Ray Boomhower and Kathy Breen in early 2011. We had three books previously published by the IHS Press – a biography of Sherman Minton in 1997 and books on Indiana governors (2006) and Indiana Supreme Court justices (2010), both of which we edited.</p>
<h3 class="subheadBlue"><strong>How did you come up with the 200 individuals and families included in the book?</strong></h3>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<p>Certainly this presented a formidable challenge given the state’s rich history and multitude of worthy individuals. The task was made somewhat easier by the decision to consider only those no longer living. Still, the challenge to decide on just 200 was daunting. While some people were obvious choices such as Abraham Lincoln, Herman B Wells, and Madam C.J. Walker, we perused every issue of <em>Traces</em> magazine and the <em>Indiana Magazine of History</em>, as well as a variety of other sources to identify others to consider. We were aided considerably by close and frequent consultation with Ray and Kathy and also by suggestions from an advisory panel that included distinguished historians and others with extensive knowledge of the state’s history and of those who had made significant contributions in various fields of endeavors.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="subheadBlue"><strong>What pitfalls do you run into during the course of the book’s development?</strong></h3>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<p>Clearly, limiting the scope to 200 was a major challenge and we were constantly revising our list as our research continued and we discovered additional people whose significance to the state and beyond merited consideration. Finding authors to write the 200 essays, of course, was time consuming, but again IHS Press editors and members of the advisory panel were of immense help. And we were fortunate that most people we contacted were almost immediately agreeable to accept the assignment, and in some cases agreeing to write more than one essay. Generally, authors had a year or so to write their essay or essays, and most met their deadlines. However, in a few instances some did not and that was one pitfall we had hoped to avoid.</p>
<h3 class="subheadBlue"><strong>Do you have a favorite person featured in the book? Is there a person you would have liked to have included, but did not make the cut?</strong></h3>

<p><em><strong>Linda:</strong></em>&nbsp;This is a very hard choice, but if forced to pick just one [favorite person] it would be Paul Emrick (1884–1965) legendary band director at Purdue University for more than 48 years. I was impressed with his creativity and his passion about marching bands. He started his long career as Purdue band director in 1905, when as a sophomore clarinetist he was elected band president and director. His innovations created college bands as we know them today. One of his major inventions was having marching bands form letters, which he introduced in 1907 when his band broke from its straight lines and formed the letter “P” on the football field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1920 Emrick was also responsible for the production of what is now known as “the world’s largest drum,” which still today is part of the Purdue band’s halftime performances. Emrick put Purdue’s band on the national map in 1935 with a performance at the first night football game in the Big Ten. At the halftime, with the lights turned down, spectators were treated to a spectacular show. As the baton of the drum major dripped fire behind him the uniforms and instruments of the band members sparkled with tiny lights. Spotlights beamed from the world largest drum. The CBS radio announcer declared “this is a real American band,” and ever since it has been called the Purdue “All-American” marching band. Besides honing the musical skills of band members, Emrick had a positive influence on their lives. Popcorn King Orville Redenbacher said he learned to “toot his own horn” in the band, and Neil Armstrong called Emrick “an icon, easily the most colorful of all my professors.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to have included Lucy Taggart (1880–1960) an accomplished artist and the daughter of political boss Thomas Taggart. She was a prominent figure in the life of the Hoosier state for over half a century. I loved her paintings. She was especially known for her portraits, but also for her landscapes and still lives. Her works were exhibited in eastern galleries such as the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine arts in Pennsylvania and for the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors at the Colony Club, a women’s organization in New York. Her work was also exhibited five times in the Hoosier Salon. She taught painting classes at the Herron School of Art and served on the Board of the school for forty-four years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Jim:</strong></em>&nbsp;My choice [for favorite person] is Charles Conn, a person previously unknown to me. &nbsp;He was not a native Hoosier, but settled with his family in 1848 in Elkhart. His fascinating and productive life included the following: decorated Civil War veteran; entrepreneur who started a musical instrument manufacturing business, which lives on today as a subsidiary of Steinway Musical Instruments; mayor of Elkhart; congressman; founder of the Elkhart Truth newspaper; and visionary business owner who introduced a widely admired profit-sharing plan for his employees in 1891. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many were hard to eliminate and one in particular [I would like to have included] was Doctor Ryland T. Brown (1807–1890), the state’s first geologist, who traveled the entire state locating stone quarries and coalfields. He was appointed chemist-in-chief for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1872 and left to become chair of physiology at the Indiana Medical College.</p>

<p>A lawyer. A surveyor. A tavern keeper. A poet. Is this some sort of weird, old-timey Village People tribute band? Not even close. These are just a few of the occupations that could be attributed to the men who descended upon tiny&nbsp;Corydon in June 1816 to write the state constitution for the Indiana Territory. I greatly enjoyed researching the characters for our newest You Are There exhibit, You Are There 1816:<em> Indiana Joins the Nation</em>. Here are a few things that stuck out to me during the research process.</p>
<p>Maybe you rolled your eyes at my silly introductory paragraph. Nonetheless, the delegates really did represent a variety of occupations. One of them, Davis Floyd from Harrison County, really was a tavern keeper. He was also a river pilot, lawyer, territorial auditor and territorial treasurer. Most of the delegates maintained several jobs at once – typical for the time period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, some of the delegates were foreign-born. The 1816 convention boasted three Irish, one Swede and one German. I expected all of them to be from other states, since white settlers had not been in the Indiana Territory for very long, but I did not expect some of them to come from abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the delegates were Southerners, coming predominantly from Kentucky and Virginia. The delegates’ Southern origins influenced their politics. For example, most delegates were against slavery being allowed in Indiana. Several of the men had been raised in families with slaves, yet, for one reason or another, had rejected the institution of slavery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond finding elements of the delegates’ stories interesting, I also enjoyed learning about them as people. It’s so easy to elevate figures of the past to some untouchable form of reality, missing entirely the fact that they were people, too. That’s one of the main takeaways I hope visitors will remember. Of course I want you to learn about the Indiana Territory, the constitution-making process and friendly Corydon. By all means, remember the three branches of government. But mostly, I want you to remember the people. That’s what history has always been about for me. The people.</p>

<p><img class="image-right" src="/blog/uploads/calvin_fletcher_holding_his_hat.jpg/image_preview" alt="Calvin_Fletcher_Holding_His_Hat.jpg" />You hear odd things in the hallways of the History Center. Recently, one of those things was "The Great Squirrel Invasion of 1822." That got my attention, so I did some digging.</p>
<p>Though it sounds hilarious, and the picture it paints is even more so, this was a devastating incident for Indianapolis residents and farmers.</p>
<p>We know all about this thanks to Calvin Fletcher – as in Fletcher Place. This guy, one of the founders of the Indiana Historical Society, kept a diary between 1817 and 1835. Fletcher was a successful farmer, lawyer, banker and state legislator. He was a huge figure in the growth of the city, arriving in Indianapolis when it was still a new settlement in 1821.</p>
<p>So back to the squirrels. They crossed the river going west. Swimming squirrels "in several places in almost countless numbers." Swimming squirrels.</p>
<p>In his diary, Fletcher calls the region's corn crop "literally destroyed." Did you know 12 squirrels could cause as much damage as one hog? According to Fletcher, one farmer claimed to have killed 248 squirrels in three days without making a dent in the scurry. (A group of squirrels is called a dray or a scurry – just some more trivia for you.)</p>
<p>Fletcher's family donated his diary to IHS in the 1920s, and what a wonderful insight into the times it is. We published them in several volumes between 1972 and 1983. If you want to read them, you can come to our library. You can even look at the originals if you want. Who knows what other bits of knowledge&nbsp; you might pick up?</p>
<p>Note: This squirrel thing happened again in 1945, but the damage was not quite as bad – just thousands of dollars' worth. <br />___________________________</p>
