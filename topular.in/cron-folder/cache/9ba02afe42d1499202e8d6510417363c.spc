There was a lot to see and do during three days of cars, friends, food and fun at the nation's largest auto show going on now through February 21 at <a href="http://www.mccormickplace.com/" target="_blank">McCormick Place</a>. Things kicked off last Wednesday with a visit to the <a href="http://www.chicagoautoshow.com/2016-cas---concept-garage/" target="_blank">Concept &amp; Technology Garage</a> where there were plenty of newfangled autos to take a gander at including the <a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/nissan-unleashes-trio-of-aggressive-winter-warrior-concepts-just-in-time-for-the-chicago-auto-show" target="_blank">Nissan "Winter Warrior" concept SUV</a> and a <a href="http://www.medexamb911.com/" target="_blank">Med Ex</a> ambulance custom made for <a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en-us/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">The Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago</a>. Unfortunately we got there kind of late and a lot of the cars were being taken off the floor to go down to the main show, but we did get to see plenty! Later that evening, <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/" target="_blank">Nissan</a> celebrated the reveal of their latest and greatest new vehicle, the <a href="http://nissannews.com/en-US/nissan/usa/releases/2017-nissan-armada-full-size-suv-makes-world-debut-at-chicago-auto-show" target="_blank">2017 Armada</a> last Wednesday at <a href="http://www.revelspace.com/fultonmarket/" target="_blank">Revel Fulton Market</a> during a Media Welcome reception.

The next morning we attended the MAMA/CATA Breakfast where MAMA President Patrick Olsen presented <a href="http://www.volvocars.com/us" target="_blank">Volvo</a> with the 2016 Family Vehicle of the Year award for the XC90. <a href="http://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">Ford Motor Company</a> Vice President Mark LaNeve was also there to introduce the 2017 Explorer XLT Sport Appearance Package and the BraunAbility Explorer MXV, the first mass-produced wheelchair accessible SUV. There were conferences throughout the day from the various auto manufacturers and a luncheon provided by the Economic Club of Chicago. Da Count and I also did some fun things, including a test drive of a <a href="http://www.toyota.com/rav4" target="_blank">Toyota RAV4</a> on a special course that simulated various driving conditions, with an inflatable beach ball as a souvenir.  We also got to win prizes at their booth by taking Instagram photos! After all the excitement and the arrival of our adopted son Grim Marco, we took the shuttle down to <a href="http://www.reggieslive.com/" target="_blank">Reggie's Rock Club</a> for the annual Sweet Home Chicago party with more food, candy treats and tasty blues music that capped off the night awesomely.

Friday was Social Media Day at the Auto Show and Twitter was hopping with plenty of updates from #CAS16! We got there just in time to do more test driving including a virtual reality distracted driving simulator at <a href="http://www.toyota.com/" target="_blank">Toyota</a> and fun test rides at <a href="http://www.jeep.com/en/" target="_blank">Jeep</a> and <a href="http://www.chrysler.com/" target="_blank">Chrysler</a> on their obstacle courses. Jeep always has an exciting ride with the simulated mountain as well as driving on a 30 degree angle and going over bumps that no other car would survive hahaha! <a href="http://www.vw.com/" target="_blank">Volkswagen</a> graciously provided a delicious lunch that afternoon as well. Check out our gallery below of some of the motorized excitement we had and come on down to McCormick Place to enjoy the 2016 Chicago Auto Show before it ends this Sunday!

Team Gregula is pleased to be covering the Chicago Auto Show for the 5th year in a row! Count Gregula himself (ME) might even make a return appearance during one of the Media Preview days! 

First staged in 1901, the 2016 Chicago Auto Show spans more than 1 million square feet of floor space of the McCormick Place complex. That's a lot of space for all car creatures to lurk around!

In all, nearly hundreds of different vehicles vill be on display, plus hundreds of interactive, aftermarket, accessories and auto-related exhibits, competition vehicles, antique and collector cars. The Chicago Auto Show also features several indoor test tracks and outdoor ride-and-drive opportunities.

Over the past 24 years, the Chicago Auto Show's First Look for Charity is held the evening before the Chicago Auto Show opens its 9-day public run at McCormick Place. This year, the extraordinary event vill be held on Friday, Feb. 12 from 7 – 11 PM.

Toyota’s exhibit at McCormick Place includes “Back to the Future” Tacoma, advanced technology concepts and Kyle Busch’s NASCAR Championship-winning #18 car.

MIND Research Institute has joined forces vith the Chicago Auto Show to get families talking about math and get students geared up for the National K-12 Game-a-thon. Visitors to the MathMINDs booth on Family Day, Monday, Feb. 15, can participate in the first-ever Math Power Game (MPG) Challenge, a series of puzzles and questions that entice the entire family to explore geometry, algebra and proportional reasoning throughout the nation's largest auto show.

Anyvay, once again, I enlisted the terror talents of my macabre musical maven Victoria Bathory to conduct a pre-show interview vith Just Kiddin. Below are Victoria's quick questions and the revealing responses from Just Kiddin. Read on.

Victoria Bathory: How did you form “Just Kiddin”?

Just Kiddin: We’d been good friends since the age of about 14, when we started a band together at school . The 1st band didn’t last long but after going our separate ways for University we started a fresh and JK was born!

VB: How did you come up with the name “Just Kiddin”? 

JK: We put it to the best panel of judges we could find, our friends. One of our closest friends claims to have a 1.25% stake in our music, he’s not kidding. 

VB: What made you want to pursue a career in music? 

JK: Because it’s the only thing we both ever did that didn’t feel like ‘a job’. 

VB: What do you believe to be your greatest opportunity or biggest break? 

JK: Probably Thinking About It – it was the first time we had released something with our friends at Eton Messy and I don’t think any of us really thought it would go as far as it did! It got picked up by Pete Tong’s label FFRR who helped take it further and was listened to over 5 million times online! That still blows our mind, to be honest.

VB: Describe your music in three words? 

JK: Uplifting, togetherness, escapism and if you’d allow one more we’d add in avocado.

VB: What do you find the most challenging?

JK: Styling Laurie’s hair in the morning - it’s a nightmare! 

VB: What is the most rewarding aspect of your career? 

JK: Seeing people connect with our music in the way we intended. 

VB: Who influences your music? 

JK: Our friends. We’ve got a really close group and we’re all really passionate about music. We started this for them really.

VB: What was your first concert? 

Lewis: Battle of the bands, Kettering

Laurie: Jethro Tull

VB: Tell me the weirdest thing about you.

Lewis: I’m addicted to humous (aka I’m a ‘humoholic’) 

Laurie: I’m a humoholic (see above)

VB: Name five things you always keep in your fridge?

Lewis: classic humous, red pepper humous, sweet chilli humous, lemon & coriander humous and blueberries 

Laurie: camembert, prosciutto, chicken, coconut water and spinach. 

VB: Fame or fortune? Why?

JK: We’re leaning towards fortune. Fame sounds like too much hassle. 

VB: What makes your music unique? 

JK: It works on the dance floor, poolside and the bedroom ;)

VB: What was the most memorable venue you played at? 

JK: Our first ever international gig a few years back in Strasbourg on a boat. We’d only released 1 song and a promoter directly messaged us and asked us to play - it was the start of this journey and something neither of us will forget. We still have the poster of it in our studio to remind ourselves how it all began.

Keep reading for a month-by-month recap of events.

JANUARY

The year started vith a milestone 80th Boo-Day celebration fit for a King. The King of Rock &amp; Roll, Elvis Presley! Then ve kept the vinter blues avay by attending The Travel &amp; Adventure Show for a second year in a row. It vas a trip vorth taking.

FEBRUARY

The second month of the year included some killer coverage of the 107th Chicago Auto Show. A new horror con called Mad Mobster left it's bloody footprint during Friday the 13th and Valentine's Day veekend. Walker Stalker decided to shamble over to Navy Pier for their second Chicago convention. Then to my surprise, I vas contacted by an old fiend to make my debut radio appearance vith Mancow on 97.9 The Loop!

MARCH

I covered my first ever Women in the Arts luncheon honoring Laurie Metcalf by Steppenwolf Theatre. The horror highpoint in March vas vhen Team Gregula finally made the trip to St. Louis for TransWorld's Halloween &amp; Attractions Show. A veek after TransWorld, Team Gregula vas invited to partake in a ghost hunt at Evil Intentions Haunted House inside the old Elgin Casket Company for their very own ghost adventure.

APRIL

Music and movies started off our month right vhen ve attended the Chicago International Movies &amp; Music Festival (CIMMfest). It was a veekend of film showings and parties, including the celebration of BAADASSSSS Award vinner Julien Temple. Ve vent to C2E2 this month and met some interesting folks from Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programs like <i>Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell</i>. <i>Insidious Chapter 3</i> brought their 4D experience that put guests IN the film via virtual reality headsets. Ve ended the month at the Chicago International Film Festival Television Awards vith guest of honor Tom Skilling and ended up on WGN's Nine O'Clock News vhen ve took pictures vith him.

MAY

More movies vere in store for us in May vhen ve checked out the Chicago Critics Film Festival. The highlight vas meeting Joan Cusack before a screening of the movie <i>The End of the Tour</i>. Ve also seen the 1989 film UHF starring "Weird" Al Yankovic as part of the 2nd Annual 26th Annual Comedy Festival. Included vas a Q &amp; A session vith "Weird" Al in person and director Jay Levey. The Chicago Humanities Festival brought Nick Offerman for a live reading of his latest book "Gumption: Relighting the Torch of Freedom with America's Gutsiest Troublemakers" and ve got his autograph!

JUNE

The month began with the Printer's Row Lit Fest and Team Gregula got the opportunity to meet Bob Saget from <i>Full House </i> at the reading and Q &amp; A of his book "Dirty Daddy: The Chronicles of a Family Man Turned Filthy Comedian". He vas hilarious and even took a selfie vith us using Countess' phone! More naughty fun took place at the EXXXOTICA Expo Chicago, vhere ve met lots of adult movie stars and checked out the merchandise *VINK*. I asked My Countess to be my date at Zombie Prom and she said Yes! Team Gregula dancing vith the dead to the beats of Libido Funk Circus vas a ghoulish good time. Mancow invited me back on his radio show this month as vell.

JULY

July vas a convention month starting out vith Anime Midwest over Independence Day veekend. The highlight vas meeting voice actor Billy West and getting his autograph for FREE. Ve vere honored to attend the very first Chicago Frights haunt con vhich vas a ghastly good time of parties and haunted house trips. There vere vendor rooms vith gory creatures and props as vell.

AUGUST

Wizard World Comic Con Chicago blew into town and brought the Bruce Campbell Horror Film Festival vith it. Ve got to attend a pre party vith food and drink and interviewed Barry Bostwick and Michael Rooker. MAJOR highlight vas getting to meet and interview the one and only Bruce Campbell himself!

SEPTEMBER

Team Gregula and their fiends got to attend a screening of "Alleluia! The Devil’s Carnival" on their cross-country tour. There vas entertainment before the movie and ve got to meet stars Emilie Autumn and Adam Pascal and director Darren Lynn Bousman. My Countess and I also vent to a exclusive lights on tour of Rob Zombie's Great American Nightmare haunted house at The Odeum in Villa Park.

OCTOBER

Team Gregula's favorite month of the year kicked off vith a head-bang at the Rob Zombie concert at his Great American Nightmare haunt. Earlier that morning ve had a chance to meet Mr Zombie and took pics, then did a private tour of the haunted house and toured it again that night vith the actors in place. There vere many more haunts to tour, from big ones like The Massacre Haunted House and Evil Intentions Haunted House to community haunts like St Pascal's Catacombs. A trip to Six Flags Fright Fest and Freaky Deaky music fest vas included. I had my third appearance on Mancow's radio show as vell. The month ended vith the annual Northhalsted Halloween Parade vith Count and Countess Gregula leading the Scariest costume entries!

NOVEMBER

Just because Halloween is over, doesn't mean the Gregulas retire for the year! SOFA CHICAGO came back to Navy Pier vith their fang-tastic vorks of art from glass sculptures to mirrored paintings. The Chicago Toy &amp; Game Fair came right before Thanksgiving and ve celebrated play, toys and the people who create them at playCHIC and the TAGIE Awards. Days of the Dead vas the same veekend and it vas one big Horror Party vith the likes of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, PJ Soles, Sid Haig and many more.

DECEMBER

The last month of 2015 vas full of class and sass! December 16th vas Ludwig von Beethoven's 245th birthday and there vas a party to honor him at Holy Trinity High School followed by a fun concert. Of course Team Gregula vould not forget to celebrate the holidays vith a bit of Ho-Ho-Horror, starting out vith the closing reception of Anthony Kosar's art show at Kosart Studios in Westmont vhere frightening vorks of art vere featured. Then ve vent back to The Massacre Haunted House for their Christmas Nightmare for more scary shenanigans and met the Krampus! Ve also vent to Lincoln Park Zoo for ZooLights to see it dressed in its seasonal finest and to visit Figor's bat relatives in the Small Mammal house.

NOTE: This is a condensed compilation of the very beast from a long year of interesting events. Special FANGS once again to Team Gregula (Countess Gregula, Grim Marco and Cousin Jessi) for all the help. Be vell, take scare and stay ghoul in the new year!

Happy 2016!

Da Count and I were hex-cited for some festive not-so-family entertainment, and the gals (and guys) did not disappoint!

The seasonal shenanigans started out with the Belmont Bombshell Dancers with special guest Rob Racine in a festive sparkly red tail coat in a performance that jingled the audience's bells. In my opinion more men should wear sequins, <i>trés sexy</i>! 

Presented by the hostess with the mostest MsPixy and her ever-present Giant Martini, the holiday hotness continued with a sexy Santa Claus striptease by Slightly Spitfire. Naughty or nice...hope I was naughty! Other highlights included a magical comedy performance by The Amazing Tomas and a new holiday tune from The Existential Cowboy with backup singers MsPixy and Busty Warren. 

There were more bodacious boobies to come as "Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies" ballet was reimagined as a fan dance and Diva La Vida shimmied in her furry abominable snowman suit that melted everyone's hearts.  A glorious finale had the entire cast singing "White Christmas" mostly topless, it was a sight to see!

This show was a holiday gift that kept on giving and Da Count and I give it a big <b>**THREE FANGS UP**</b>!
