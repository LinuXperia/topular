When asked to describe their mentoring relationship, David spoke of Byron’s genuineness. “Byron’s been incredibly sensitive and responsive,” says David. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">David and Byron’s mentoring relationship is unique on many levels. David, a 62-yr-old retired physician, is not your stereotypical homeless person. He’s neatly dressed (always), meticulously groomed and often uses words that need to be looked up in a medical dictionary for comprehension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>David’s nearly three- year stint with homelessness was a result of a litany of health issues; not until David moved into his new apartment has his health started to rebound. Byron has been a part of his stellar return to health.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mentoring an older adult has its own dynamics as Byron has visited David in the hospital, in rehabilitation centers and has accompanied him to various doctor appointments. Byron, a retired Eli Lilly employee, is happy to do so. “I’ve been very blessed. I’ve always felt a desire to help others.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Byron retired early in life in order to enjoy travel, spend time with family (he’s a new grandfather) as well as give back through volunteerism. “What I like about Trusted Mentors…more than other things I do (as a volunteer is that) this is more personal.” Byron speaks of how appreciative David always is and how watching him progress with his health has kept him motivated to mentor. In the midst of walking together down this path towards health, the two have visibly built a close bond. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">David got connected to Byron, his Trusted Mentor, through HIP (Homeless Initiative Program). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>There, his social worker Lillian, assisted David with finding stable housing. David had the insight that he would need strong relationship connections in order to assist him with maintaining stability and meeting his goals of becoming healthy and whole again. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>“Where I live, there’s nobody there that I can talk to like I talk to Byron. We talk about everything—sports, politics…” (Byron grins and mentions that he doesn’t even discuss politics with his wife). “We always find something to talk about.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As we parted ways, Byron and David were mapping out a plan to help David gain more strength and mobility, to include working out at the YMCA and walking on local trails once the weather improves. Byron retold his rendition of the star fish story to David—“if all of us did one thing to help out another, the world would be a better place.” David finishes his cup of coffee and you can see the gratitude written on his face. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://trustedmentors.blogspot.com/2016/02/mentoring-older-adult-brings-unique.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"noreply@blogger.com (Trusted Mentors Inc)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2016-02-24T06:30:56.651-08:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6096090362782997919.post-5420303164978803465";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 19:54:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"We are not our labels--a renewed perspective for the Holidays";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4369:"  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br />So it makes sense that, working for a nonprofit, our boss would give us designated paid "time off" each month to volunteer. And it makes sense that I would spend those precious volunteer hours mentoring (no-brainer). <br /><br />What never ceases to amaze me though is how much I gain as a volunteer mentor for Trusted Mentors. I've been a social worker for going on twenty years (seriously)---and I find that the mentoring relationship is especially unique. Yes, my background gives me certain insights into addictions, domestic abuse, homelessness, and other social issues that our mentees (and some mentors)&nbsp;have faced. Still, there is nothing quite like the experience of walking alongside someone down their rocky and well-beaten path. <br /><br />Mentoring my new mentee is no different. She is a vision of strength and fortitude. Looking at her, you see a young, attractive, highly energetic woman. Her energy and style make her seem younger than her chronological age. When I met her at Salvation Army Shelter for Women and Children, I liked her immediately. One of the first things she said to me was something like, "Are you sure you're ready for me?" I'm thinking, “Do you have any idea what my "normal" life even looks like lately?...and yes, I'm sure." <br /><br />The beginning of our relationship was a virtual download of her life---addictions and failed relationships, peppered with hopes and dreams. She said that she felt "safe" telling me anything. She would preface some of her musings with, "Are you sure you don't have to tell anybody this stuff?"<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">"Yes, I'm sure--as long as you're not a harm to yourself or others." Okay, good, here comes another download. <br /><br />And I have been more than happy to be present for her, to be an active listener, an encouraging voice, a cheerleader, a believer in her own hopes and dreams (even when she's not so sure). "You can do this. You are not alone. You are stronger than you think." These are my mantras. <br /><br />I realize that these are also my own mantras. You see, she and I are really not so different. We are both fundamentally women, we are mothers, we are partners/wives, we are both high energy and highly motivated. We both have our "demons," our "triggers," our "old ways" of thinking and doing. We are both on a life path filled with hopes and dreams that include being a good parent and making a difference in the lives of others.<br /><br />I had the pleasure just last week of taking my mentee out to lunch for her birthday. We started off with a birthday hug, when she proclaimed that "that was my first birthday hug!" We enjoyed a hamburger at Bru Burger because, living down the street in the shelter, she smells the wafting scents of the restaurant daily and has developed quite the craving. At the end of our lunch, before I parted to return to work, I told her that I not only saw her as my mentee, but also now as my friend. I told her that she and I are not so different. You see, she is not a jumbled mass of labels--<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">homeless, ex-felon, mentally ill, addict</i>--and neither am I. We are, at a basic level, both human. We share laughter and tears, she's getting to know my struggles as well, and she loves to share her own advice. <br /><br />It's only been a couple of months, but I feel like I've known her forever. Our relationship is authentic. She knows she can be real with me (and vice versa). All I have to do is listen and encourage. If you can do these things for another adult trying to stabilize their life, please consider being a volunteer Trusted Mentor.&nbsp; I promise, your life will be enriched. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;By Shelley Landis, Mentor Match Manager and Volunteer Mentor</o:p></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://trustedmentors.blogspot.com/2015/12/we-are-not-our-labels-renewed.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"noreply@blogger.com (Trusted Mentors Inc)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-12-23T11:54:59.309-08:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6096090362782997919.post-7100828214166785747";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 20:15:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"Mentoring Domestic Violence Survivors--One of the Many Faces of Homelessness ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9796:"  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So, you know about Trusted Mentors. You know that we mentor adults coming out of homelessness, re-entering the community from incarceration, and aging out of foster care. &nbsp;I’ve been with Trusted Mentors for more than three years now and have found that my favorite part of the job is learning about the many faces and facets of homelessness—to meet those faces and to delve into their stories and triumphs. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One of the faces of homelessness is survivors of domestic violence. A recent mentor -match was held at Coburn Place Safe Haven. Our new mentee is fascinating enough—her story is inspirational and really demonstrates the will to survive under dire circumstances.

Shy confidently took the microphone from her mentor’s hands and launched into a heartfelt message of gratitude. “Mary sees me for me. She doesn’t see me as a number, as a criminal, as an ex-offender.

She will move into an apartment, along with her two kids, while maintaining the job she’s held while living at the Craine House. “I’m mostly nervous about how my children (ages five and eight) are going to react.” Since they were ages five and two, her children have been raised back in her small rural hometown by their grandmother. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="color: #373737; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When asked how having a mentor has helped her to stay positive and focused while in the Craine House, Shy spoke of the enduring value of friendship. “At first, I mostly wanted a mentor to get out in the community.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It didn’t take long for Shy and Mary’s mentoring relationship to blossom. “I love having Mary in my life. She’s not like a counselor or case manager. She shares her life with me. She’s a true friend. It’s great knowing you have someone you can trust and have freedom to be yourself with.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mary and Shy have indeed explored the community. Shy shared a story about a special outing that Margo planned as a surprise for her mentee. Shy shared, “Mary doesn’t like the outdoors, but she knows<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do.” Mary planned a day hike around the IMA’s 100 Acres Woods one sunny fall day. Shy says that Mary was out of her comfort zone: “She hates nature and bugs… She planned this outing because she knew it was something I’d enjoy.

I think you’ll enjoy hearing about her life, her adventures, and her “lessons learned” from being in AmeriCorps, the PeaceCorps, and now a Trusted Mentor. Welcome Erin to Trusted Mentors! <o:p></o:p></span></i></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">I am about to become an official Trusted Mentor, and I want to be honest and straightforward right off the bat-- I am not here to change the world. And neither should you be. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">If you looked at my resume’, you might think I was lying to you: AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, ESL Tutor, Refugee Youth Mentor, and the list goes on in an almost embarrassing volunteer, superbly hippy-like manner. It may seem like I’m trying to change the world- and make it a better place, a more peaceful place. I am not.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Again, I am not here to change this world. And if I were to really think I could, I never would. Here are some examples of how I came to this seemingly despairing point of view.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">1. My parents taught me so.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">I was born and raised on an organic vegetable farm. My parents were the only organic vegetable farmers in probably all of Indiana, and nearly the Midwest. They farmed organically long before farming organically was cool. I guess you could call them the “hipsters” of the agriculture scene. So, like anybody that does something against the grain, they fought hard to prove that “being green” is beneficial to our bodies and our environment. Some people even believed organic foods were more likely to kill people!&nbsp;  The core belief behind their growing dictated they could not change the world-in this case, the world representing nature. They could not manipulate and make Mother Nature better. Rather, they wanted to work with it. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">A quick example is the potato beetle. For years, this beetle ravaged our crops. They could have used a quick-acting pesticide, but instead they picked and killed those beetles by hand. But they made sure to leave all natural predators such as the soldier beetle. Several years later, the population of potato beetles balanced out. Good bugs AND bad bugs. They built a relationship with nature, and made themselves stronger farmers with stronger soil and plants in order to withstand her furies, and always be able to enjoy her pleasantries. My parents did not try to manipulate nature but work with it to create a balance. This philosophy played a large role in my outlook on the world. I can’t change it, but I can work with it.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">2. Idealism failed.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">First, I thought college represented intellectualism and activism- putting our cerebral capacities to work and solve the world’s most horrendous human rights abuses. However, many students found their peace in red cups and football games. Theatre, Anthropology, and Peace Studies rolled up into one stressed-out, fed-up Butler University Student. (That would be me.) Human rights classes, social activist theatre pieces, and studies abroad in India, South Africa, and Russia helped to develop my keen eye for injustice and a stronger desire to change the world. However, change kept coming up short. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">I decided to dedicate a year of service to underprivileged youth on the south side of Chicago. Again, idealistically, I believed only the selfless would work for AmeriCorps and our presence, obviously the sum greater that its parts, would create drastic change in these young lives. Well, my objective Anthropology courses and continual idealistic failures finally started to kick in-I cannot change the world, and neither can anybody else. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Inspired by my co-team leader and her simple brilliancy, I truly understood my White Savior Complex. Co-Team Leader being an African-American woman, she called out my pity feelings and sad thoughts for our students and the societal abuses they endured. The responsibility lay in my hands. And those young students had their own responsibilities. My AmeriCorps team held their responsibility, too. I could not make them better workers or more understanding white people. Similarly, I could not make my students avoid a life of violence. I could, however, control my behavior and reactions to the people and life around me. I could be a friend. An equal. I could not feel sorry for others, believing- innately, implicitly, secretly- I was better somehow.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">So, I tried it out some more in other volunteering venues. I mentored refugee youth sisters and tutored adult ESL students. These one-on-one meetings created a world of equality between teacher/student and mentor/mentee not previously understood. I got rid of end goals, better worlds, and concrete successes. I exchanged it for giggly moments, shared meals, and honest conversation. I exchanged changing the world for making friends. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">3. One stubborn woman.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Peace Corps! Funny thing about the Peace Corps- most people believe it the essence of world changing. How wrong they are! Any volunteer who believed such madness hated their service.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Luckily, my previous mistakes equipped me with the power to not care about changing the world. For a good six to eight months, in my small, non-electric rural community, I hung out. Chilled. Learned a new language, participated in many dance parties, and met new people-mainly by eating their food, drinking their tea, and taking naps at their houses. Turns out, not changing the world made that stressed-out Butler student float right away.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Through this process, I made a habit of building very strong relationships; one of the strongest was with my host mother, Jeynaba Lo. She took care of me like I was one of her own. In fact, she continues to tell me I am one of her children, and always will be. This woman is tough. I am talking cement, steel, and platinum all combined together tough. She barely reaches five feet, over fifty years old (life expectancy at fifty-nine), and she could grab my fifty-pound pack and haul it on her head through an entire flood plain. She don’t play. Tough.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">But, let me be clear: this woman, and this village, suffered daily. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Every month I went to a funeral. Babies died from hunger. Jeynaba suffered immense loss as her brothers and friends passed away too young for many U.S. citizens to fathom. Jeynaba struggled every day to make sure rice filled the lunch AND dinner bowls. Jeynaba ran a household of men, one of whom, her son, would beat his wife if Jeynaba left the house. I’m ranting. But I am talking about real-life problems. Things that should make you feel sorry for people, and then want to change the world.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">But I never felt sorry for her. Nope. Not for a second. I worked with her on most projects I executed in the community. We worked in the fields together every week. She taught me how to plant sweet potato, how to harvest hibiscus, and the best way to eat a fresh watermelon-by shoving your face in it, obviously. After eight months or so, I began to teach her some things-improved spacing, composting, and soil amendments. These teachings were simple conversations, an honest exchange of ideas. Months later, I discovered Jeynaba conducted her own test plot of techniques we discussed. She witnessed their success first-hand. She was thrilled-due to her relief that she was not wasting her time on some crazy white girl. That I might have a thing or two in my stringy-haired head. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Life continued. We ate more rice. Worked more fields. Exchanged more ideas. One moment stands out in particular. We were working in her field, and I believe we were arguing over spacing of trees. I had my reasoning, she had hers. She got crazy frustrated, and called me stubborn. I paused, in shock and awe, and called her stubborn right back. She said, “Well, I guess that’s finished.” We laughed so hard as we took the long walk back to our huts. Just two stubborn women trying to make some crops grow and fill those rice bowls.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Jeynaba’s stubbornness paid off. She convinced the entire women’s garden to discontinue the use of chemical fertilizer. She got nasty about it too, doing the “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">I told you so</i>’s” every time a woman experienced bad crop production<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_GoBack"></a>. A year and half into my service, I had farmers from other villages coming to ask me questions about their crops, seeking advice. I would give my five to ten minute lecture. Then, Jeynaba would step in and hold an hour-long conversation with the newcomer. I was no longer useful. Doubtful if I ever really was.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12.8pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 113.85pt;"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 13pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Jeynaba owned her knowledge.

She asked me to delve a little deeper in order to share my thoughts in this months’ blog. Enjoy! </span></div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In both my personal and professional life, I’ve worked with personality and strengths-finder testing instruments. I’ve come to understand that our personalities as mentors and mentees can shape what we expect or want out of the mentoring relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For example, I suspect that those who want to focus on setting and reaching goals have a highly “conscientious and scheduling” personality (i.e. goal-oriented), whereas a person who has “low conscientiousness”, but has a highly “agreeable and intellectually or artistically inclined personality” style (i.e relational) will be more interested in understanding, connecting, and learning about the other person in the relationship. What a mentor defines as a healthy mentor-mentee relationship may be different from how the mentee defines it based on their different personality types. Mentors and mentees may want to learn about each other’s personalities to reach a deeper level of understanding. Some of the following ideas illustrate this point.</span><br />  <br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">·<span style="font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font: 7pt/normal &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“People don’t care what you know until they know that you care.” –John Maxwell. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>As mentors, we know it’s important to build trust in the relationship. For some people, trust comes from getting to know the other person as a friend, and for other people trust comes from staying true to your commitments: we don’t know how the other person views trust or the mentor-mentee relationship until the relationship unfolds.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">·<span style="font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font: 7pt/normal &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mentorship doesn’t always come in a formal goal setting environment. When I transitioned from growing up in a poor neighborhood to going to college working as a research assistant at a university, I learned a lot of things about life, culture, and society just by hanging out and talking with co-workers. Simply spending time with these individuals helped me to grow and transition. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">·<span style="font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font: 7pt/normal &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Research shows that having a good and positive relationship with someone can dramatically boost our mood and self-esteem (personalityresearch.org). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It has also become apparent that when a person gets lifted out of generational poverty, they almost always have a key person in their life who encouraged them (Devol, Payne, &amp; Dressui Smith, 2006). </span></div><br /><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt 0.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">·<span style="font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; font: 7pt/normal &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When mentors and mentees understand each other and communicate, they will discover what the other person thinks the relationship should look like.

During this time I pondered how I would be making a difference once I connected with my mentee, and how all would flow from there. I had anticipated some difficulty, but had not deeply considered the roadblocks and challenges that I would soon face. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">I remember it like it was yesterday; it was, in fact, the night before Thanksgiving of 2013 when I was introduced to my mentee. We met at a quaint coffee shop with our Mentor Match Manager present, and immediately hit it off after a few minutes. She said I was not what she expected and I smiled, hoping this was a good thing. We talked briefly about our similarities and sparked up a strong connection about a common passion we shared. She was, to me, a bright soul bursting with potential and from the very first day I was excited about building our relationship. We exchanged phone numbers and made arrangements to meet the following week.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">At our first meeting together we sat in a quiet space and as we began to continue the journey of getting to know each other, she revealed more about herself to me. She also asked that I do the same, and I obliged. As I am usually a private person, I felt happy to reveal myself to her in order to start building a connection and hopefully earn her trust. I was in awe of her ability to be open, inquisitive, and optimistic. I thought that, for a young woman, she had such wisdom. We smiled and laughed as we sat sharing with each other our thoughts, our lives, and our struggles. I encouraged her and also gave her my full support, letting her know that I was there to help her through this journey and would be happy to do whatever I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She acquiesced and we had made a plan to meet again the next week.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">The next week came and I was excited about our meeting, I could hardly wait. We had bonded almost instantly, and got off to a rocket start. I had in mind things I would do to enrich our meetings, books I could give her, movies I would recommend, and places we could go for a shared learning experience. I was disappointed when I was unable to meet with her that week, but we had confirmed that we would speak again soon. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Many phone calls later I finally reached her. Disheartened by our misses, I asked that she make an attempt to touch base with me once a week, and she consented. When this did not happen I began to feel more disheartened. I could not understand why, if we had such a good connection and had what felt like the perfect match, she was not more eager to sustain our bond and utilize my offering of support. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">This was the beginning of challenges as our conversations became infrequent. We had a meeting one chilly evening at a coffee shop where we outlined her goals, and both wrote down what we wanted from our relationship. We then both signed this paper as an agreement that we would honor. It did not take long before she could not keep up her end of the bargain. Frustrated, I crouched in doubt and cynicism, which is a default emotion for me when I cannot figure something out to my liking. I began to slowly close off myself to the possibility that this would be a success story or bloom into anything substantial. I had tried to help and was turned away; my attempts to make a difference felt futile.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">I received news the following month that my mentee had been hospitalized. It was then I realized that there were bigger issues and challenges that I had not completely taken into factor. I had always considered myself to be versed in the area of trouble, having gone through some devastating emotional tribulations, but there were other things that I could not know, like what it felt like to be physically homeless, or to grow up watching a parent being abused, or being abandoned by your caretakers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">This sweet girl had gone through so much of that, had seen so much in her life that she had not even the space to process it all. She had been abused and frightened, and had learned how to do what most of us do to survive, and that is to shut down our insides. The people and systems of support she had needed to trust had let her down when she needed them the most. There were all sorts of social, emotional, mental and spiritual challenges that I had not fathomed that she was still working through. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Trust was not something that was easily available to her in her vocabulary of being. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">And it dawned on me. Who was I then to think that I could come in parading my abilities, my save-the-world ideals, and think that I deserved to be trusted. I had, in fact, not earned her trust and though I had tried, it was not going to be as easy as I thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What it took for me then was a paradigm shift and a commitment.

This is an art, which if we master in ourselves will help us to do that for others. But in truth, many of us have not, we are somewhere in the middle, learning how to have compassion with ourselves and with others too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is a great balancing act. This, however, in true perspective can give us more grace as mentors, as fallible human beings who are reaching out to help another fallible human being because, though we may not comprehend all of their pain, we know what it is like to hurt and to cry and make mistakes. We are all living yet another day in the one-day-at-a-time program of life.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">To date, my contact w</span><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Cambria;">ith my mentee is gradually coming along and that is enough for me. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I have pillared myself in the process, to be here whenever she needs me, as long as I am able, without having to dictate when that need may be. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Cambria;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">I am willing to wait and to be hopeful.<o:p></o:p></span></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://trustedmentors.blogspot.com/2014/05/mentoring-homeless-young-adults-one.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"noreply@blogger.com (Trusted Mentors Inc)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-05-29T14:27:53.179-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6096090362782997919.post-8181317363490015435";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 17:58:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Mentor Musings, with Second Helpings";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2985:"  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thanks to Janet (not real name) for sharing her story of mentoring a Second Helpings’ mentee. <o:p></o:p></span></i></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When I first began mentoring, I didn’t quite know how to support my mentee. She seemed to have all the help she required. She was doing well in school, and staying busy with her family and friends. I didn’t see or hear from her much because of her busy life. I thought she was on the right track. Did she really need me?? I was lucky to be matched with such a creative, smart, caring woman, but I was having problems reaching out to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">did</i>want to have a mentor in her life; I just needed to give her enough time to trust me and share her problems and struggles. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When we met during the first few months of our relationship, we had easy conversation about our day-to-day lives. She talked quite a bit about her past, explaining why she was in her current situation. I tried to not question her too much; I genuinely enjoyed listening to her story (she has a great sense of humor too). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I was learning about her complex life a little bit at a time, which was fine with me. I wanted to be a part of her support system, yet I still questioned exactly <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">how</i> I was going to do that.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Each time we got together (usually at a coffee shop with baked goods!), she shared something new about herself. I was beginning to see how I may “fit in” with her busy life. I had an “aha” moment when I realized how I could have a positive influence on her life. I’m someone who offers her a different perspective; she listens to my opinions and ideas. I realize she may be sharing some thoughts and concerns mainly with me; I’m a “safe” person for her to bounce ideas off of. I also give her a reason to “get out” and explore. Really, I feel I’m there to listen more than anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I’m thankful that I’m here to support her when the time is right. I am here to encourage her creative mind and listen to her ideas. I hear about struggles she may not share with others. I learn more about myself by being her mentor. </span><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We have a place in each other’s lives. </span></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://trustedmentors.blogspot.com/2014/04/mentor-musings-with-second-helpings.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"noreply@blogger.com (Trusted Mentors Inc)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-04-18T10:58:18.197-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6096090362782997919.post-918539111293062130";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 20:01:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Reflections from a New Mentor";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6989:"  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">If I had been asked to mentor six months ago, I would have definitely been interested but probably would have declined, thinking it wouldn’t realistically fit into my busy schedule. &nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Between work and school I feel I barely have time for my important “me” time. However, I know that when I find something I truly want to do, I manage to find the time. &nbsp;Yes, I want to help others and make this world a better place. &nbsp;But building a relationship is not a task to draw a line through once accomplished. &nbsp;I hadn’t anticipated how much mentoring would impact me.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">In January, I started a one semester internship at Trusted Mentors as part of earning my masters in social work. &nbsp;After a couple months connecting mentors and mentees, I knew I wanted to become involved more than professionally. &nbsp;About a month ago I expressed my interest in becoming a volunteer mentor. &nbsp;I had a general understanding of what that involved. &nbsp;As Trusted Mentors works with individuals who are at risk of homelessness, I imagined applying mentoring in this context. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I admit, the idea of mentoring made me assess my knowledge of homelessness, and frankly, I found myself feeling a little insecure. &nbsp;Though I feel stable and accomplished and therefore able to be a role model--what did I know about overcoming homelessness or poverty? &nbsp;It is one thing to experience the stress of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">possible</i> poverty, but quite another to actually <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">experience</i> it. Before my anxiety increased too much, I was quickly calmed by the Trusted Mentors staff who reassured me that the most important part of mentoring is building a healthy relationship.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">What does a healthy relationship look like--&nbsp;stable, trusting, accepting, supportive. &nbsp;My mentee described a mentor as “someone I can be open and honest with, without any judgment.” &nbsp;And I could help her reach her goals through “support… and be[ing] nice.” &nbsp;I love my mentee’s answers and they gave me confidence that I can provide the support she needs. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Having experienced prejudice and discrimination myself, I can relate to not wanting to be judged. &nbsp;Mentoring started me thinking about what we each need, and supportive, positive relationships are a need I think we often don’t think about. &nbsp;How often do we ask ourselves, “What healthy relationships do I have in my life?” &nbsp;My appreciation for healthy relationships has greatly increased as I interact with individuals who have little or no support. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">As an intern, I am genuinely giddy to hear mentees benefiting from the mentoring process. I have not been matched very long, but I have thoroughly enjoyed learning more about my mentee. &nbsp;I see strengths and beautiful qualities in my mentee, which she doesn’t yet realize. &nbsp;I am witnessing how a healthy relationship can help her view herself and her future more positively. &nbsp;I feel myself learning and growing in bounds as my perspective broadens. I am deeply touched by her trust and vulnerability when she confides in me. &nbsp;I look forward to our friendship growing over the following year and longer.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br />If you enjoy volunteering, I highly recommend giving mentoring a chance! <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Marea Kinney is a Graduate Student Intern with Trusted Mentors through the IUPUI School of Social Work. <o:p></o:p></span></i></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://trustedmentors.blogspot.com/2014/03/reflections-from-new-mentor.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"noreply@blogger.com (Trusted Mentors Inc)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-03-21T13:01:23.640-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6096090362782997919.post-738151734773951986";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 18:26:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"Serving the Homeless along with the 100,000 Homes Initiative ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5716:"  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Recently, the 100,000 Homes Initiative was adopted by Indianapolis and Trusted Mentors quickly jumped on board as a key partner. Our city is a proud participant in this national effort to house our most vulnerable homeless neighbors.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Every Tuesday, we attend a housing committee meeting at the Horizon House with multiple 1000,000<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Homes partnering agencies serving the homeless population in our city. Every week, we hear the names and stories of chronically homeless men and women who now are being given the opportunity to move into an apartment of their own. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>What a great feeling it is to be a part of this national movement to move people out of homelessness!</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Although our city has experienced success moving many of our homeless from streets and shelters into housing, we are seeing that the transition for many is proving to be a difficult one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The skills needed to help an individual survive on the streets are different from the skills needed to remain housed and/or employed. Developing new skills, such as time management, budgeting and being a good neighbor takes practice. These newly housed men and women need guidance and support as they deal with spiritual, emotional and social issues to include isolation and low self esteem.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The local 100,000 Homes Initiative views Trusted Mentors as a vital partner in combating homelessness because mentors help their mentees develop these new skills. Through a mentoring relationship, mentors help their formerly homeless mentees build social capital <span style="background: white; color: black;">by helping them to form connections and to become integrated back into the community. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="background: white; color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Take B.W.’s story of a “typical” mentee referral for Trusted Mentors. B.W. was referred to us by the Horizon Houses’ Pedigo Clinic. B.W. is a 53 year-old chronically homeless male with both mental and physical illness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When my intern and I sat down and spoke with him for an hour last week, we received an ear full about where B.W. sees his future going once he’s housed. B.W. has multiple interests to include a love for animals and a skill set in home rehab. B.W.’s primary goal is to give back to his local community as a volunteer and he sees a mentor as someone who can help him make these connections. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="background: white; color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">B.W. shared that depression and isolation have been a real issue for him since he lost his parents in 2011. He’s never been married and doesn’t have any children. He says that he doesn’t make friends easily, especially since he’s been in recovery and has stopped hanging around friends who use. B.W. is looking forward to developing a friendship with a mentor to improve his quality of life. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="background: white; color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Since joining our local 100,000 homes initiative, Trusted Mentors has seen our homeless prevention mentee referrals almost double.

She told me that he was on a positive track as he’d managed to secure both housing and work and was setting long term goals. Just four days before he was planning to take a bus out to California to live with family and to pursue higher education, he reoffended and was rearrested. His hopes for the future are again deferred. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I asked about her uncle’s support system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She said he had no one. After spending twenty years in prison, he had no friends, and very little family to help him stay on track, stay focused, and stay encouraged. She said, “He could have used a mentor.”</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Contrast my friend’s story with a couple of our Trusted Mentors’ mentees. Both mentees are re-entering our community from the prison system. Both men have high hopes for their futures. Both men recognize the benefits of having a mentor.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Joe is starting his life anew here in Indianapolis. He’s not originally from here; he came to a city where he knew very few people and had next to no support. Joe states that a benefit of having a mentor has been having a friend in a “foreign land” to help navigate a new city. “Aaron has helped me find an apartment, given me advice on money management and helped me while I was looking for a job.” </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Joe shares that the best part of having a mentor is “knowing there is someone that I can always talk to about anything. Aaron doesn’t judge me and he listens to what I have to say. Most of all, he is very encouraging and always has a positive attitude.” Joe knows that he’s not alone as he surmounts the many challenges that lie ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He says that Aaron’s positive attitude is contagious and has aided in boosting his self esteem, even as he hits road bumps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">At age 49, Lavert too is transitioning into a new phase of his life. His mentor, Andy, has helped him move into a stressful workforce and has assisted with housing and other goals. Similar to Joe, Lavert states that having a mentor is a positive for him as “it helps me when I have someone to share what’s on my mind…no matter what it is.” </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It’s common for mentees coming out of homelessness or re-entering society after incarceration to become overwhelmed and discouraged. The reality of re-entry presents with a myriad of obstacles including: institutionalization, lack of education/ job training, lack of housing and stigmatization. The most poignant thing that Lavert shared with me about his mentor Andy is this: “Best of all, he (Andy) gives me hope even when I can’t see it.” Hope out of hopelessness—I hear this time and time again from our mentees and the sentiment is felt as these “ex-felons” open themselves up to restorative relationships with a Trusted Mentor. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Who knows if the difference between the successes of our mentees versus the uncle’s demise was having a mentor? We do know that having a mentor makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">a </i>difference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Trusted Mentors reports that 89 percent of our re-entry mentees remain out of the prison system once they’ve been matched with a mentor.

He’s a well dressed, handsome, middle aged, well educated man whose life just didn’t pan out as he expected. But it didn’t happen overnight. His life came crashing down gradually over a period of seven very unlucky years. The hardship began with a painful divorce from his wife that resulted in several consecutive losses—his daily life with his beloved children, his home, his middle class life with all of its familiar comforts.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The next domino fell as James was laid off from his job of 20 years within the aviation industry where he worked as a Senior Tech Specialist and Project Manager for Boeing. Then the economy tanked, which made it difficult for him to transition to another job in the midst of a glutted job market in California. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Upon learning of his father and uncle’s failing health, James made a decision to move to Indiana to be with them during their final years. He’d already suffered the loss of his mother several years earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At this point, James had roughly $20 in his pocket, along with the contents of his car. He lived in his car and stayed with family until both his uncle and father passed away. James was able to find various odd jobs to keep his head above water until his own health took a dramatic downturn.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“My heart stopped all the time.” James reports that he’d walk short distances and feel fatigued. Finally, he ended up in the hospital after passing out cold in the middle of the street one day. His doctors wouldn’t let him leave the hospital as they were concerned that he may have a “death experience”. After enduring an endless battery of tests, James was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure and was gifted with a combination pacemaker/ defibrillator in April of 2013.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This fall, James was hired on as the House Manager for Gennesaret Men’s Recovery Home, a place that allows homeless men to recover from various surgeries and physical ailments. James is appreciative of Gennesaret and most enjoys listening to the other men coming into the home. “I know what they’re talking about because I was there--they let down their shield and open up to me-- because they know I can relate.”</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I asked James about lessons learned from these life-changing experiences. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>“I didn’t appreciate things—more importantly, I didn’t appreciate people, relationships. I didn’t even appreciate myself.” James looked into Dean’s eyes, his Trusted Mentor, as he shared this lesson. It’s evident that their relationship is one that both men appreciate. It’s one that’s reciprocal as Dean shares that he too had a life altering injury and has therefore reordered his priorities in life.

As I watched this mentor pair interact, it was evident that Dean has been a consistent presence for his mentee James during his time of transition out of homelessness. James spoke of a time when several days had gone by when he didn’t hear from his Trusted Mentor. James had been struggling personally, and Dean had been consistently messaging him or dropping a quick call. Because James had gotten used to Dean’s consistent support, he felt the void when it was absent. It turns out that Dean had his own personal emergency come up—thankfully, James was able to help <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">him</i> through it. Tables were turned and James was present for his mentor.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I often remind our volunteers that being a mentor is indeed more about “being” present than “doing” xyz for their mentees. A mentor is consistent, supportive, encouraging, uplifting, trusting, hopeful. A mentor is truly many thing--but presence is paramount. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I recently heard from another woman who just began mentoring a young adult aging out of foster care who turns 22 next month and therefore loses financial subsidy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I asked a more seasoned Trusted Mentor what his advice to her would be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Andrew offered several practical ways she could help her mentee around issues such as financial responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And he ended his advice with these words: “Be there”.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #444444; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the book <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Bowling Alone</i>, Robert D.

Putnam shows how changes in work, family structure, age, suburban life, television, computers, and other factors have contributed to this decline. In my work with the homeless and at-risk community, I see the evidence of social isolation—loneliness, depression, hopelessness, despair. We are made for connection and something is lost in our human experience without these significant relationships.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: #444444; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I frequently refer to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Bowling Alone </i>and Putnam’s findings when I share the benefits of the mentoring relationship—both for the mentor and the mentee.

Mostly young men, all without families, several escaped homes that had been ravaged by civil wars, genocide, and natural disasters. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">These young men had enjoyed some of the opportunities provided to them by the U.S., not the least of these being the opportunity to obtain a college education. A couple of the young men shared with me that they had completed one to three years of higher ed until tragic bits of their stories caught up to them in the form of mental illness. PTSD and Depression are common among this group, as well as the general population living under the bridge and in our communities as homeless neighbors. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">A new friend, Leroy, a refugee from Liberia, shared that he had secured a job, an apartment-- stability. However, due to a glitch in the system, he ended up losing benefits that he needed to make rent; therefore, he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>lost his housing and found himself living under the bridge. It was evident during my interactions with Leroy and the others that the bridge had become their community. The “Lost Boys”, as we call them, had found each other under the bridge and created their own family. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As Mentor Match Manager at Trusted Mentors, I work primarily with the formerly homeless population, matching these men and women with volunteer mentors. Mentors help bridge the gap from life on the streets to a more stable and hopefully fuller life. What the city, and many others, fail to recognize is that, regardless of the morality of the bridge closing, a community, multiple “families” were displaced, were separated, were torn apart on Monday. To make the transition from homelessness to stability will require the time, energy and efforts of all of us, of the broader community, to bridge the gap. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"></span>&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mentor trainings held monthly.

My friend is in the prime of her life-- enjoying travelling the world, running her own editing business, and giving back to the community in many ways as a volunteer. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In sharp contrast to her story, my 50 year old formerly homeless friend who passed away a few days ago was not the picture of health. When I met him, roughly five years ago, he was living in an abandoned house down the street from my urban office. He was squatting in his family home that was foreclosed <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>following<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>his job loss and ensuing debt. J was a college graduate, an intelligent man, but a combination of substance abuse and failing health caused his bout of homelessness. Unfortunately, hard living in addition to a chronic heart condition caught up to him and ended his life early. J was a Trusted Mentors mentee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">A partnering agency case manager once commented, “We work with society’s cast-aways.” In reality, many of our mentees have been rejected by society, abandoned by family, and burned bridges with friends and colleagues. Many others, by deciding to “live life differently,” have walked away from friends or connections who supported their addictions or lives of crime. Either way, the formerly/ homeless and re-entry populations are at high risk of loneliness and isolation. Fortunately for J, his Trusted Mentor was able to build a quality relationship with J during the final years of his life. Still, J died alone. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One elderly mentee who is a PIH resident comes to mind as I think about our aging homeless population. Beth is in her seventies and lives alone at Partners in Housing. She has no family connections as she’s divorced and never had children. Her agency case manager referred her to Trusted Mentors because Beth (not real name) “desires companionship.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>At this stage in her life, she has no lofty goals involving education or career: she simply wants to experience some enjoyment in her life and is in need of a friend. I relish reading the reports from her mentor who shares stories of outings that the two of them enjoy together. Beth raves about the joy she shares with her mentor as they participate in community events and re-engage in hobbies (Beth is a retired artist and loves First Fridays!). I know that Beth’s mentor is adding quality to her life, during her final years. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The isolation and loneliness that plague the formerly homeless aging population can be detrimental. </span><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/loneliness" title="Psychology Today looks at Loneliness"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Loneliness</span></span></a><span style="color: #333333; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> may increase the risk of death among the elderly, but the health effects of social isolation may be greater than those of loneliness, according to a new study published in the <em><span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-style: normal; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-style: italic; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Yet, this woman’s spirit still lit up the room.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Her story, unfortunately, is not uncommon. Yet her inner strength and resilience is one that boggles the mind. I often encounter mothers who have lost children due to the system, to an ex-spouse, to domestic violence, sometimes even to death. As a mother myself, nothing cuts deeper then the idea of losing my child. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The depth of human spirit that can resurrect a joyful soul out of the ashes of loss is dumbfounding. What is just as exceptional is the willingness to step out again in relationship. Our mentees have all experienced losses (mentors too!), yet they continue to take steps forward. Opening up to a new mentor relationship is an act of faith; it opens the mentee up to potential hurt or disappointment that accompanies any new relationship. They are “putting themselves out there” relationally: they are vulnerable. They are taking a risk. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This mentee freely admitted that her trials are not yet over. Her son is back in her home, thanks to support and advocacy from her referring agency and others; however, her housing is still unstable and employment is a question as her illness has barred her from moving forward. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Our mentees are invited to share their goals with their new mentor during their first meeting. Many of them hesitate, desiring to focus on the relationship and building trust first. However, this particular mentee filled up the page with goals…and with hope. As she moves towards stability, with her mentor guiding and supporting her along the way, I will fervently enjoy watching her blossom. I share her faith and hope in the future. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Trusted Mentors is the only agency focusing 100% on mentoring adults to combat homelessness and to improve outcomes for young adults aging out of foster care and for individuals exiting the criminal justice system.

Our guest speaker, Tim Streett, held the room’s attention as he shared his fateful story of coming to forgiveness. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tim Streett is presently the assistant director of Shepherd Community, but his ministry work was not the focus of his talk at tonight's Trusted Mentor Recognition Night. His words carried a much more solemn tone as he shared his story of his father’s dramatic murder, which he witnessed as a teen here in Indianapolis, and his ensuing path to forgiveness.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tim’s road to forgiveness wasn’t a straight path as he took several detours with drugs and alcohol during his college years. He related that he felt a hole in his chest that was “God-sized” and used substances to try to fill that empty void--to no avail. His emptiness could not be medicated. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tim eventually found the courage to forgive his father’s murderers by reaching out to these men who were serving life prison sentences. Tim talked about forgiveness as an “action” that serves as the first step to inner healing. Tim shared that he wasn’t able to release his anger and bitterness within until he took the critical step of forgiving his father’s killers. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As I panned the room filled with mentors and mentees-- men and women with various backgrounds including ex-offenders, formerly homeless individuals, and young adults aging out of foster care-- I could almost see the message seeping in. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One female mentee is still dealing with her own anger toward an abusive parent. In adulthood, her anger had turned into bitterness and then severe depression that was exasperated by job loss—this tragic mix led to a bout of homelessness for her. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One young man was working on forgiving his mother for giving him up for adoption and forgiving his father for never being present in his life.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I could only imagine some of our other mentees who’d served their own prison sentences for various crimes and how they struggle with their own paths to forgiveness, including forgiving themselves. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yet, through all of these trials and hurts, each mentee has developed a relationship with a mentor. These relationships can set the foundation for healing past wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The road to healing can be long; however, anyone who’s been hurt has been hurt in relationship with other people.

The agency I worked for, and am still connected to, equips and empowers low-income families as they pursue their dreams of first-time homeownership. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One of my first families was a single mother named Julie (not real name), with two teen children. Julie had recently completed a program in administration at Training Inc. and was fortunate enough to land a nice-paying job immediately following graduation. Julie had paid off her debt, began saving, and came to our agency ready to become a homeowner. She was so excited to build a legacy for her family by having something to pass on to her children. This accomplishment was especially sweet as Julie had grown up in the foster care system and had lived in multiple shelters and group homes, experiencing an unstable childhood--to say the least.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Over a year ago, Julie’s house burned down while the family was away on Thanksgiving break. The family returned home only to find a charred shell of a house. By this time, Julie had lost her nice-paying job and was unemployed. The tragedy of losing a home was too much to bear, so the family decided to start over in another state. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">About a month ago, I received a phone call from Julie, indicating that her daughter, Camille, who recently turned 18, had decided to move back to Indianapolis to reunite with friends and her network of support. Her goal was to enroll into a local older teen/ young adult transitional home, go to school and start her career. Unfortunately, things have not worked out as orderly as she planned. Camille called me soon after arriving in Indy with a frightening plight. The family that she had planned to stay with lost their housing and she would soon be homeless in February. Since she didn’t have the necessary ID (many homeless folks don’t), she had to seek help from an agency who sent off for paperwork…a 3 week or more wait ensued. In the meantime, she’s been staying in a homeless women’s shelter and has already started working on her GED. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As she waits for her ID so that she can enroll into the homeless transitional housing, a more stable environment, she tries daily to keep her spirits up. While working with a partner agency to coordinate services for her, the young case manager has indicated to me that the most important thing we can do now is surround Camille with a network of support. I talked to her about matching Camille with a Trusted Mentor and she jumped at the opportunity, stating that one thing that makes a difference for these young adults trying to make it is positive adult support. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So, the three of us have set a lunch date to cheerlead Camille. I am happy that she will also be our newest mentee awaiting a Trusted Mentor to develop a meaningful relationship of support. I will stay involved in Camille’s life for some time to come, and I look forward to adding a mentor to her support network. Please consider becoming a mentor to encourage folks like Camille. </span></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"http://trustedmentors.blogspot.com/2013/04/close-to-home.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"noreply@blogger.com (Trusted Mentors Inc)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-04-03T13:57:52.805-07:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6096090362782997919.post-8106809914965487975";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 20:08:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"Help Trusted Mentors make it to the FINAL FOUR!

We initially met during our Bags 2 Riches Gala where she volunteered as part of the planning committee. Her infectious energy and friendly demeanor made her a standout amongst the volunteers that evening and I knew I wanted to recruit her as a mentor. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Mae shared, “My life motto is to make a difference, to profoundly impact someone’s life for the better.” She stated that she feels our “deepest impact is made through close relationships.” </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">She spoke about our mentees, who are coming out of recent homelessness or incarceration, as people who have “a lot to admire.” They are “resilient and have fight and are able to empathize more” with others who are struggling. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>She also talked about the mentee population in general as being nonjudgmental of others who have experienced hardships. </span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I then posed the following interview question to Mae: “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">How do you understand a mentor to be different than a rescuer</i>?” Her answer was poignant, striking a chord with me. She said that the difference is, rescuers take action and the evidence of their work is external. A service is provided such as a hot meal or a warm winter coat. Mentors, on the other hand, focus on internal change. Through longer term, meaningful relationship, mentors impact what happens within their mentee so that sustainable change occurs. In other words, mentors don’t look for quick fixes--they work relationally.</span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When asked what she hopes to gain from a mentoring experience, Mae spoke of her desire to meet people that she “wouldn’t normally get the chance to meet” in her normal day to day life. “Everyone has a story” to share. Mae admits that she’s working on developing her listening skills, as she rightly asserts that listening is paramount as a mentor--as it is in any good relationship.
