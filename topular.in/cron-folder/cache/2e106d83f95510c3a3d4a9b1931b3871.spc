The national level winners of the 2014 election were sworn into office today completing the overwhelming Republican triumph in the most recent election and crystallizing the ugly wipeout for Democrats, whose base simply stood down rather than fight the inevitable 2014 GOP tidal wave.

In the Senate, the GOP needed to hold all of their seats and gain at least 6 Democratic seats for a majority. They successfully held all their seats and flipped 8 Democratic seats, winning every toss up race except New Hampshire.

In the House, Republicans picked up 13 additional seats to increase their majority to 247-188, winning 15 of the 24 true toss up races, and stealing 3 races Democrats were expected to win. The new GOP majority will give the party its largest majority in the House since January 1931.

In governor's races, Republicans added two states to their already impressive stockpile, now controlling the executive branch in 31 states (really more like 32 since Bill Walker is a Republican governing as an independent in Alaska).

With all this good news for Republicans and their new majority in the Senate, let's begin 2015 remembering a couple key points of U.S. history. While the GOP's 247-188 House majority sounds impressive, it is far from the largest majority a party has held. Since 1913, when the House expanded to 435 members, there have been 4 instances in which the majority party had 300+ seats, and 26 times where the gap between the majority party and the minority party was larger than what it will be in the 114th Congress. As recently as January 2011, Democrats had 257 House members.

On the other hand, many Democrats comforted themselves late last year with the idea that they will easily take back the Senate in 2016, during a presidential election year. However, since 1960, when a majority party in the Senate enters an election year with fewer than 55 seats, they maintain control in the next election about 70 percent of the time. The Senate has only changed hands 6 times since 1960 and half of the time the majority party who lost had 55+ seats, which means that the Senate rarely changes hands and the gap between the majority and minority party is rarely relevant in determining the likelihood of a flip. Democrats can win back the Senate if they earn it, but just because the map looks good, doesn't mean they can overlook the need for very strong candidates and equally strong narratives.

One under-rated factor that will help Republicans is their dominance in state legislatures across the country. The GOP holds a majority in 36 state senates and 34 state houses. Many of those are super majorities. Some are unexpected such as Republicans winning a majority in both houses of the Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, Wisconsin and Ohio state legislatures and winning a majority in the Maine State Senate, Minnesota House, New Mexico House and New York Senate.

State legislatures and governor's mansions are the proving ground for many future national political leaders and those offices often serve as a minor league system for future U.S. House Reps, U.S. Senators and future Presidents along with cabinet level secretaries. The GOP bench is stacked with talent, many of whom are now in their third, fourth and fifth term in state legislative office or have been successfully re-elected to their governorship or other statewide elected office. Meanwhile, multiple years of Democratic failures at the state level have decimated their ranks of fresh, young, up and coming politicians with experience in elected office and a proven track record of winning elections. Democrats aren't going away; but, their recovery will require more attention to the state legislatures, where their national brand of economic liberalism won't find many sympathetic ears.

The tough task of governing now lies ahead for the elected class of 2015 and the 114th U.S. Congress. As Republicans, today is our last day to relish in the monumental 2014 victories on the national level...but here in Illinois, we have one more party to throw next Monday as we inaugurate our state's 42nd governor, the first Republican to hold the office in 12 years.

So here's one last thank you to all the Republican voters, candidates, campaign staffs and volunteers who made the 2014 victories possible and a tip of the cap to all those Democrats who couldn't bring themselves to vote with the GOP; but, gave our party permission to govern by standing down on Election Day 2014.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Brian Matos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4556:"It's a historic day in Washington, D.C.

In the Senate, the GOP needed to hold all of their seats and gain at least 6 Democratic seats for a majority. They successfully held all their seats and flipped 8 Democratic seats, winning every toss up race except New Hampshire.

In the House, Republicans picked up 13 additional seats to increase their majority to 247-188, winning 15 of the 24 true toss up races, and stealing 3 races Democrats were expected to win. The new GOP majority will give the party its largest majority in the House since January 1931.

In governor's races, Republicans added two states to their already impressive stockpile, now controlling the executive branch in 31 states (really more like 32 since Bill Walker is a Republican governing as an independent in Alaska).

With all this good news for Republicans and their new majority in the Senate, let's begin 2015 remembering a couple key points of U.S. history. While the GOP's 247-188 House majority sounds impressive, it is far from the largest majority a party has held. Since 1913, when the House expanded to 435 members, there have been 4 instances in which the majority party had 300+ seats, and 26 times where the gap between the majority party and the minority party was larger than what it will be in the 114th Congress. As recently as January 2011, Democrats had 257 House members.

On the other hand, many Democrats comforted themselves late last year with the idea that they will easily take back the Senate in 2016, during a presidential election year. However, since 1960, when a majority party in the Senate enters an election year with fewer than 55 seats, they maintain control in the next election about 70 percent of the time. The Senate has only changed hands 6 times since 1960 and half of the time the majority party who lost had 55+ seats, which means that the Senate rarely changes hands and the gap between the majority and minority party is rarely relevant in determining the likelihood of a flip. Democrats can win back the Senate if they earn it, but just because the map looks good, doesn't mean they can overlook the need for very strong candidates and equally strong narratives.

One under-rated factor that will help Republicans is their dominance in state legislatures across the country. The GOP holds a majority in 36 state senates and 34 state houses. Many of those are super majorities. Some are unexpected such as Republicans winning a majority in both houses of the Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire, Nevada, Wisconsin and Ohio state legislatures and winning a majority in the Maine State Senate, Minnesota House, New Mexico House and New York Senate.

State legislatures and governor's mansions are the proving ground for many future national political leaders and those offices often serve as a minor league system for future U.S. House Reps, U.S. Senators and future Presidents along with cabinet level secretaries. The GOP bench is stacked with talent, many of whom are now in their third, fourth and fifth term in state legislative office or have been successfully re-elected to their governorship or other statewide elected office. Meanwhile, multiple years of Democratic failures at the state level have decimated their ranks of fresh, young, up and coming politicians with experience in elected office and a proven track record of winning elections. Democrats aren't going away; but, their recovery will require more attention to the state legislatures, where their national brand of economic liberalism won't find many sympathetic ears.

The tough task of governing now lies ahead for the elected class of 2015 and the 114th U.S. Congress. As Republicans, today is our last day to relish in the monumental 2014 victories on the national level...but here in Illinois, we have one more party to throw next Monday as we inaugurate our state's 42nd governor, the first Republican to hold the office in 12 years.

So here's one last thank you to all the Republican voters, candidates, campaign staffs and volunteers who made the 2014 victories possible and a tip of the cap to all those Democrats who couldn't bring themselves to vote with the GOP; but, gave our party permission to govern by standing down on Election Day 2014.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

Topinka began her career in public service years before I was even born. With a degree from the Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism and a background in reporting and editing, she entered public life by running for an Illinois State House seat in 1980. She won that election and went on to serve in both houses of the Illinois General Assembly before getting elected to statewide office for this first time in 1994. She served as Illinois state Treasurer for 12 years, being re-elected twice, before running for governor in 2006, the first Illinois governor's race I was old enough to vote in. Judy Baar Topinka was the first Illinois Republican candidate I ever supported or voted for. I could even make the case that Judy Baar Topinka and her 2006 gubernatorial campaign is one of the reasons I ended up being a Republican.

My mother and most of the women in my home neighborhood were enthusiastic to finally have the option to vote for a woman as the state's chief executive. They felt they could identify with Judy, as they called her, and they would finally have a leader of the state that knew what it was like to be a mother, a working woman and a community leader. Topinka's political style was also very different from what I had seen in other politicians. Where others were stiff, boring and cold, Topinka was charismatic, enthusiastic and warm. I only met her in passing during the 2006 campaign; but, she made an impression on me. This was someone to look up to and aspire to become. Even in defeat, she was clearly the better candidate in that race, a fact the state found out the hard way years later.

I must have met Judy Baar Topinka a dozen times or more over the years of being involved in local media, political action groups and the Chicago Young Republicans. She was always excited to meet young professionals and find out what we thought about the state as well as offer advice for our careers. If you had 5 minutes, she had a story for you and the younger you were, the more she wanted to teach. My conversations with her never lasted more than a few minutes because she was being ushered off to another event or meeting; but, 5 minutes talking to Judy Baar Topinka was more valuable than an hour with most political leaders.

Some state Republicans used to refer to Topinka as a moderate Republican, using the term in a derogatory manner. In fact, she was an inclusive Republican and a winner as opposed to the exclusive wing of the party who have turned into chronic Election Night losers. Where others tried to push issues that kept people out of the party, Topinka threw open the doors and invited anyone with a small government heart to come in. When men in the party were uncomfortable with a woman running for chief executive, she proved them wrong and outdated. Topinka knew how to win with grace and how to govern with compromise once she did.

As Treasurer (the first woman to ever hold the office in Illinois), she managed state investments that earned more than $2 billion and received Standard and Poor's highest bond rating. She also introduced the Bright Start Program, which helps parents and grandparents invest their dollars in a tax-free savings account for their child’s college education.

As Comptroller, one of her tangible achievements was setting a new standard for transparency by creating the Ledger, an up-to-date, comprehensive online financial database that is available to every taxpayer. Using the Ledger, residents can see everything from daily balances and state bill backlogs to all employee salaries. Everyone from reporters to private citizens has been able to use this database to see what is really going on with state expenses. This is exactly the kind of transparency required to earn back the trust of a doubtful public.

Some complained that Topinka was too old to continue serving, yet she was the one who modernized the Comptroller’s Office, transitioning to electronic payments and record keeping, saving the state millions in paper and postage alone.

Perhaps Topinka was ahead of her time and can only now be appreciated in the context of what Illinois politics has become. Today's national and state leaders can learn a thing or two from Topinka's legacy of compromise and treating people (friend or foe) with dignity and respect. Illinois is a better place because she lived and served here. We will all miss her, young and old alike. We can honor her memory by trying to be more like her, showing enthusiasm for public service and kindness toward everyone.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Brian Matos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4712:"Like so many Illinoisans, I was deeply saddened to hear State Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka passed away early this morning at the age of 70.

For those who tune in when there are pending elections, here is a little cheat sheet of what to watch for as the returns come in Illinois tonight:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Control of the United States Senate</strong></span>

Democrats currently hold 53 Senate seats with an additional 2 Independent senators who caucus with them while the GOP holds 45 seats. To win control of the Senate, Republicans need 51 senators, or 6 more than they have today.

There are 36 seats up for election this year, 11 of which are nearly certain to remain Democratic and 13 nearly certain to remain Republican while an additional 4 are very likely to switch from Democratic control to Republican. Assuming the prior statement is true, Republicans need to have a net gain of 2 seats from the 8 remaining races, 2 of which are currently held by the GOP the other 6 by Democrats.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> There is a very good chance we will not know if the GOP has won control of the Senate tonight. Many races may be too close to call while others end up in run-offs. If it comes down to Alaska, their polls don't even close until midnight in Chicago. Locally, Dick Durbin is expected to win by double digits over his GOP challenger, Jim Oberweis.</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Control of the United States House of Representatives</strong></span>

Republicans currently hold 233 House seats, Democrats hold 199 and there are 3 vacancies. Democrats would need a net gain of 19 to win control of the House.

Every two years, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election. According to <em>Real Clear Politics</em>' average of polls, the Republican majority is safe and the GOP should safely win 226 seats (losing one GOP seat but making up for it by winning a Dem seat in New York) with another 30 categorized as "toss-ups." Twenty of those 30 toss up races are currently held by Democrats. Most polls have Republicans picking up at least 5 seats and perhaps as many at 15. If the GOP picks up at least 9 seats, it will have the largest U.S. House majority since 1946. A pick up of 13 will give the GOP that largest margin in the House since 1928.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Republicans will remain a majority in the House but the exact margin will not be known tonight. Locally, the race to watch is IL-1o between incumbent Demcorat, Brad Schneider, and the former Republican Congressman in that district, Bob Dold. Races in the IL-11th, IL-12, IL-13 and IL-17 are worth keeping and eye on. All except IL-13 are currently held by Democrats.</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Illinois Governor</strong></span>

This is an extremely close race between incumbent Governor, Pat Quinn, and his Republican challenger, Bruce Rauner. Polling data shows a statistically tied race, with a slight advantage to Quinn. Chicago and Cook County usually report results before the rest of the state so expect Quinn to have  huge lead out of the gate. Exit poll data and Rauner's numbers in Chicago and suburban Cook County should provide key insights as to whether their strategy is panning out or if they have to hope that collar county and downstate turnout and support was gigantic.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> We will probably have a winner by the end of the night. If Quinn's get-out-the-vote operation in Chicago and Cook County replicated it's 2010 success, we could know by 10 or 11pm that he has won. If his campaign workers fell short of their goals and team Rauner fulfilled their promise to turn out 10,000 volunteers across the state to create their own get-out-the-vote army, we could be waiting until midnight or beyond for rural and small town votes to be reported.</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Illinois Statewide Officeholders</strong></span>

Democrats Lisa Madigan and Jesse White are each expected to be re-elected as State Attorney General and Secretary of State respectively while Judy Baar Topinka should easily cruise to reelection as State Comptroller. The only real race in this bracket is for State Treasurer between former Republican House Minority Leader, Tom Cross, and Democrat State Senator, Mike Frerichs.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Just as in the race for governor, we may not know the result of this race until late in the evening unless the Cook County/Chicago Democratic turnout machine was in over drive.</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Illinois State Senate</strong></span>

Democrats currently hold a 40-19 super-majority in the State Senate. Only 7 seats are being actively contested tonight, 6 Democrat, 1 Republican. It is mathematically impossible for Republicans to win control of the State Senate (they would need a net gain of 11 seats and even if they win every one on the ballot, they would be 5 short). Best case scenario, Republicans hold their seat in the 24th district and find a way to win 5 of the other 6 competitive races and break the Democrat super majority. This is unlikely.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> While John Cullerton will still hold a super majority in the State Senate, the margin might be less than it is today and it will be interesting to see how his dynamic Republican opponent, Stephanie Linares, does in head-to-head match up in his north-side, Chicago district. </em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Illinois State House</strong></span>

Democrats currently hold a 71-47 super majority in the State House.

All 118 seats are up for election tonight, though only 48 are contested. Republicans would need a net gain of 13 to win an outright majority and end Michael Madigan's reign as Speaker of the House. This is unlikely. Republican minority leader, Jim Durkin, is hoping to have a net gain of at least one to break the super majority and give the Republican minority a more robust voice in state legislation.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Mike Madigan will remain Speaker of the House and it is unclear if he will still have his super majority or if he will lose a couple seats. We may not know for sure tonight.</em>

In conclusion, tonight may not have a real conclusion.

It is mathematically impossible for Republicans to win control of the State Senate (they would need a net gain of 11 seats and even if they win every one on the ballot, they would be 5 short). Best case scenario, Republicans hold their seat in the 24th district and find a way to win 5 of the other 6 competitive races and break the Democrat super majority. This is unlikely.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> While John Cullerton will still hold a super majority in the State Senate, the margin might be less than it is today and it will be interesting to see how his dynamic Republican opponent, Stephanie Linares, does in head-to-head match up in his north-side, Chicago district. </em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Illinois State House</strong></span>

Democrats currently hold a 71-47 super majority in the State House.

All 118 seats are up for election tonight, though only 48 are contested. Republicans would need a net gain of 13 to win an outright majority and end Michael Madigan's reign as Speaker of the House. This is unlikely. Republican minority leader, Jim Durkin, is hoping to have a net gain of at least one to break the super majority and give the Republican minority a more robust voice in state legislation.

<em><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Mike Madigan will remain Speaker of the House and it is unclear if he will still have his super majority or if he will lose a couple seats. We may not know for sure tonight.</em>

In conclusion, tonight may not have a real conclusion.

</ul>
The primary reason that Pat Quinn should not get another term is that Illinois is better than the results listed above. In some states, hampered by bad demographics, geographic disadvantages or poor access to international markets, under-performing the rest of the country is understandable. In Illinois, the 5th most populous state in the union, located at the center of the country, with vast natural resources, an internationally famous megalopolis and ideally situated for transportation of all kind, results like this are totally unacceptable. We must demand better.

Elections are always about the future. This is particularly true if you are a 20-something like me who will bear the consequences for public policy choices made today. Therefore, it is not good enough for me to explain why Pat Quinn SHOULDN'T be governor, I need to articulate why Bruce Rauner SHOULD be our next governor.

Bruce Rauner is the first candidate for Illinois governor in many years to possess the qualities and skills necessary to help Illinois achieve it's full potential.

So what makes Rauner the right person to lead the 5th largest state in the country? Here are the top 5 reasons from the perspective of a young Illinoisan:

<strong>1) Bruce Rauner is as close to incorruptible as you can get in politics</strong>

Why does this matter to a young person? Public corruption and fraud have a heavy price tag that get passed on to future generations. When state contracts include bloated promises that are to be paid by those of us who barely started working, it locks in a reality of future tax hikes that will be higher than any of our future wage increases. Using public debt to finance politically expedient programs that do not help long term development for the state passes a financial burden onto our generation and that of our children.

The recent history of Springfield is riddled with politicians who make themselves rich by passing crippling regulations in exchange for lobbyist favors and then they start law firms so private citizens have to pay them to navigate the very laws they passed in the first place. In case you haven't heard, Bruce Rauner is very wealthy. Bribes aren't going to be attractive to him. Lobbyists and lawyers can line up outside his office offering vacations, private jets and sports cars in exchange for favors; but, Rauner can laugh in their face knowing that their money is a pittance compared to his personal fortune. Seriously, who is going to buy influence with Rauner? He has every incentive to do right by the people of the state so he can get another term and no incentive to jeopardize his reputation for worldly goods that he can already buy himself.

<strong>2) You may not have to move away to find good jobs</strong>

Unlike past governors, Bruce Rauner's primary focus is to create jobs in Illinois. He is staking his legacy on his promise to generate job growth. That is great news for 20-somethings who want to stay here but can't find work to support their cost of living. Rauner's business acumen and experience give him a unique understanding of what people need to start successful small businesses. His national and international business relationships will give Illinois an inside edge over other states in drawing capital investment and getting large national companies to bring some of their jobs to our state without using tax incentives.

<a href="http://brucerauner.com/bruce-rauner-releases-jobs-and-growth-agenda/">Rauner's economic plan</a> is the most comprehensive of any governor in the country today and seizes on Illinois' natural advantages. While one governor can not jump start the state economy on his own, the fact that a credible leader will be presiding over the state should help calm the fears that the business community has about making investments in Illinois. If Rauner is able to jump start business growth, then not only will college grads and skilled young workers have plenty of good paying jobs to choose from, unskilled students who are still working their way through their education will have abundant opportunity as well. Getting people off welfare programs and back to work will dramatically decrease state budget deficiencies. Nothing helps a state budget faster than turning low income residents who receive state dollars into middle income residents who stop receiving those benefits and begin paying income taxes instead.

<strong>3) You can seriously consider settling down here to raise a family</strong>

Twenty-somethings think about more than just their self interest. Many of us are engaged and some already are married with young children. Where we decide to raise our families is a huge decision and one we take seriously. Many young people have decided to move to high growth states with reliably good schools because they have come to believe their children will have more opportunities and a better long term environment in which to raise a family if they move away. When you start thinking about buying a house, and the property tax and education considerations involved with that, we start thinking about all the states we might want to move too. This is especially true if you have family in another state.

Bruce Rauner's tax and education policies, if implemented, will give young families a break and make us more likely to consider staying. If Illinois is going to have a bright future, it needs young professionals and colleges grads to stay, get married, raise families, buy houses and get involved in their communities. Hopefully, a few of those families will go on to start businesses that create even more jobs and opportunity. It all starts with keeping young people from leaving the state.

<strong>4) You can be proud to be an Illinoisan again</strong>

Let's admit it, as young people, we like to live in a "cool" state. Illinois will never be as glamorous as New York or California and will never have the tropical appeal of Florida. We don't need to. We just want to be a welcoming Midwest hub of culture, creativity and prosperity. Chicago is the key to that image. If we can get students and international tourists to our biggest city, we might be able to get some of them to explore other parts of our historic state. Bruce Rauner will never be the national figure that Chris Christie has become but he can become known as the leader/champion of a revitalized Illinois. He represents a break from the past, a breathe of fresh air and a chance to rebrand this state as one the is open for business and welcoming of anyone who wants to work or visit. The improved reputation of the state will help inspire confidence in young people to not only stick around a trendy state but maybe to move back if they already left.

<strong>5) Someone who will listen to us</strong>

Most politicians don't care about 20-somethings. We don't vote in the same numbers as older voters and we don't have as much money. Bruce Rauner understands that helping the youth of the state is an investment in the future which will pay dividends. More than a year before the primary election, Bruce came to a Chicago Young Republican Happy Hour event in the loop. He shook every hand and listened intently as young person after young person came up to ask him questions and tell their story. He connected immediately with the room and was generous with his time. It's a small gesture, but many politicians ignore after-work events like this. Rauner was genuine and engaged. More importantly, Bruce has six children of his own and thinks about the what kind of state will await them in the future.

I am not writing all of this to suggest Bruce Rauner is a perfect man, with a flawless life who will save Illinois. I simply believe that who he is and what he stands for is in line with what this state needs from it's governor if young people who live here are going to have a good adult life. We should feel good about taking our chances with Bruce Rauner, because we have no chance with Pat Quinn.

If you believe, as I do, that Illinois really is a special state that has unique opportunities to capitalize on, than I hope you will agree with me that Bruce Rauner is the perfect person to lead our state out of the past decade and a half of misery and into the next generation of shared prosperity.

If you are in your 20s, you may not be able to remember a time when Illinois was a respected, relevant state in the country. Illinois can be a desirable place again, home to a booming economy with broad opportunity for people of all skill levels. Our education system can be #1 in the country. Our budget can be balanced and our taxes fair. To achieve this, we need a new leader in Springfield.

We have lived through Rod Blagojevich/Pat Quinn's administrations and know they failed to achieve these promises because their ideas were as bad as their corrupt leadership. Bruce Rauner is the credible alternative we have been looking for. His election truly would shake up Springfield in a way that would deeply disturb the established political class. If you believe Bruce can fulfill his promise of bringing back Illinois, than I ask you to not only vote for Bruce Rauner, but to vote early. Don't wait until Election Day, have your voice heard now.

Both Democratic and Republican controlled state legislatures and chief executives are taking action on fiscal and economic matters under their control, setting off a competition among the states to create the most desirable place to live, work, start a business and raise a family. State lawmakers are also taking local and regional action on labor, health, budget, infrastructure and social issues. This renewed spirit of federalism is encouraging to those of use who recoil at consolidated power seated in just one federal capitol.

While the states surrounding Illinois have given up on waiting for Washington, D.C. to act and started to re-organize themselves and pass serious reform legislation to compete for businesses and residents, Illinois has not. Our state government waits on pins and needles for federal dollars to do anything or enact any innovative program while neglecting even the simplest of state responsibilities, paying the bills on time.

It's time for Illinois to seize it's own destiny and reorient its government to become the master of its own affairs rather than continue to be subject to the whims of D.C. power players.

This election is extremely important in Illinois because it might be the best chance in a generation to damage the ingrained layers of corruption, cronyism, clout and unethical practices that have strangled Illinois's economy. To most people, electing Bruce Rauner as our next governor may seem like merely a passing of the torch from one party to another. In reality, the election of Bruce Rauner would send an unprecedented shock wave through the Springfield political universe. For the first time in living memory, a financially independent chief executive accountable only to voters and not special interest groups would occupy the governor's mansion. Lobbyists, special interest groups, lawyers and entrenched state lawmakers who built a political system to enrich themselves at the expense of their constituents never planned on having to deal with someone who is not in on the same game, subject to the same system of personal financial rewards and risks. Sure, he will have to pull a few veteran Republican politicos out of retirement to kick start his administration, but these are not people who stand to gain much from involvement in state government any more. Rauner's very existence as governor pokes a big hole in the intermingled web of Springfield influence that corrodes public trust and fails to improve living standards.

Rauner's election would be particularly consequential in the state agencies. While Republicans are generally leery of large state bureaucracies, some agencies have critical responsibilities that impact basic public safety and well being. Getting them to function efficiently (or function at all) would be a welcome change. There are fewer ways to immediately improve the quality of Illinois government faster than by improving the leadership and accountability in the big state agencies.

In Illinois, these creaky agencies have been home to political patronage workers for decades while failing to efficiently perform their essential functions on behalf of the public. Part of what fuels the Democratic machine in Chicago is the exchanging of high paying state agency jobs to unqualified political lackeys in exchange for their time generating support for Democratic candidates. The Department of Human Services alone has more than 13,000 employees. The Department of Corrections has over 11,000 employees and  the Department of Transportation, where Quinn administration hiring practices are under investigation, has more than 5,300 employees. Those critical agencies are growing headcount all the time to make room for new political hires while failing to provide positive results for the public.

Due to existing collective bargaining rules, some patronage bloat will be hard to cut immediately and some state workers are nearly un-fireable; but, Rauner would appoint new, experienced leaders for these agencies charged with the mission of cleaning up the corruption endemic in them and creating more efficient departments capable of accomplishing their mission while being held accountable for results. The State Senate may hold up some of those nominees; but, will ultimately acquiesce to avoid the appearance of shutting down state government.

Ideally, the new administration will apply a modern human resources function to state government to determine which positions can be eliminated and which employees should be retained and rewarded. A modern, transparent recruiting/hiring system needs to be established to bring talented people into state government to replace under-performing public servants with disciplinary/productivity problems. Recruiting, retaining and motivating smart, capable employees is something the private sector does much better than the public sector and hopefully Rauner can bring this business function into state government.

Many powerful interests stand to lose a lot of influence and access if Bruce Rauner becomes governor. There is a reason Democrats are hyperventilating over the polls and throwing every negative ad they can concoct on the Chicago airwaves. They know the consequences of electing Rauner as governor are monumental and irreversible.

However, without also shaking the state legislative leaders, Rauner will be restricted in dealing with the state's biggest challenges, all of which are related to financial issues that the legislature must deal with.

This is where voters can go the extra mile in this election. While no one expects either the State House or State Senate to flip from Democratic control to Republican control, voters can send a serious message to Senate President John Cullerton and House Speaker Michael Madigan. First, voters need to send State Senate Minority leader Christine Radogno and State House Minority Leader Jim Durkin reinforcements in the form of electing new Republican State Senators and Representatives. Those who live in Sen. Cullerton's district can send him an extra shot across the bow by voting for his opponent, Stephanie Linares, a Chicago Tribune endorsed criminal defense attorney who is beyond qualified to serve Chicago's north side neighborhoods and would bring a breathe of fresh enthusiasm to Springfield. Linares represents a complete break from the past and symbolizes the new face of the state GOP and a new generation of leaders for the state legislature. She is a superstar in the making and a professional worthy of the public trust. A woman with energy, intellect, courage and integrity...basically the exact opposite of John Cullerton in every possible way.

If the election goes well for the state GOP, Republicans will hold four of the six statewide constitutional offices. However, to send a clear message to Springfield that our state is ready to seize the day and our destiny, we need to go further. Replace the tired, stale, uninspired legislative leaders with bold, fresh and innovative new ones. Elect and appoint a new generation of leaders to reform and restructure the foundation of state government to meet the challenges of our time without relying on a dysfunctional federal government.

If we get this election right, there is still time to correct past mistakes and chart a course for prosperity and success. Electing Bruce Rauner is a good start and provides the reform movement with a leader; but, he is just one person. He will need allies in the state legislature and dedicated professionals willing to lend their expertise to state agencies and contribute as public servants. Reform is never achieved through one person, it is achieved through a movement lead by ordinary citizens taking action.

For those of us who live and work in Illinois, we have a chance to proclaim that tomorrow can be better than today, that we don't have to be held hostage by a broken state government and that we are ready to do what is required to make Illinois a land of prosperity again, the envy of the nation.

This renewed spirit of federalism is encouraging to those of use who recoil at consolidated power seated in just one federal capitol.

While the states surrounding Illinois have given up on waiting for Washington, D.C. to act and started to re-organize themselves and pass serious reform legislation to compete for businesses and residents, Illinois has not.

Thanks in large part to the integrated multimedia strategy Liston helped craft and implement, President Obama bucked all historical trends and won re-election despite relative low approval ratings and economic indicators.

Normally, we could care less about who is married to who in the media world. What difference does it make who your spouse is? It might matter if you author a hit piece about a front running Republican candidate for governor one month before the general election that happens to paint him as anti-women and that story goes on to become the center piece of an integrated multimedia ad campaign by the Democratic candidate. The timing of the story and the timing of the subsequent ad campaign launch lends to at least the appearance of some sort of collusion.

This is the story at issue as it aired on NBC 5 Chicago on Monday, October 6, 2014: <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/Hard-Ball-Lawsuit-Alleges-Rauner-Intimidation--278326501.html">http://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/Hard-Ball-Lawsuit-Alleges-Rauner-Intimidation--278326501.html</a>

The crux of the story is this: When Bruce Rauner, the Republican candidate for Illinois Governor, was chairman of the investment firm GTCR, he hired Christine Kirk to start a new company called LeapSource. The business struggled under Kirk's leadership with Rauner and Kirk trading accusations over who was to blame for the failures.
<p data-pnum="12">According to a lawsuit filed by Kirk, Rauner told another board member if Kirk sued over her firing, "I will bury her ... I will bankrupt her with legal fees. I don't know if she has a family or not but if she does she better think twice about this." Rauner denies ever saying such a thing.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">In her sworn deposition, Kirk alleged she was also warned by Thomas Gilman, another plaintiff along with Kirk in the lawsuit, who sat on the Board of LeapSource, saying, "Bruce had threatened" her and would make her "radioactive." Rauner denies this allegation as well.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Federal District Judge Robert Broomfield dismissed almost all of the counts of Kirk's lawsuit and neither of the plaintiffs agreed to be interviewed for the story. No one outside of the plaintiffs corroborated their accounts of what Rauner allegedly said.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Given the outcome of the lawsuit and the lack of sources willing to talk to the reporters, is there any journalistic value to this story? It is wonderful fodder for a campaign opposition researcher to craft a negative ad campaign around; but, where is the news value for the public or the voter? Essentially, the court ruled that the lawsuit was frivolous and when the reporters tried to get the plaintiffs to repeat their allegations from their depositions, they didn't want to talk about it. Then, the reporters could not find anyone else at LeapSource or GTCR to corroborate any part of the deposition statements.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Bruce Rauner's campaign was not only right to challenge the merit of publishing a poorly sourced story that served a purely political purpose but also to bring up the possible connection between this "war on women" article, its accompanying ad campaign and the wife of the reporter who essentially crafted the very concept of such a campaign.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Mr. McKinney took offense at being questioned by the Rauner campaign. After the story and subsequent ad campaign failed to gain traction with voters and move the polls, the reporter took the extraordinary step of publicly announcing the hiring a famous investigator to look into vague allegations that the Rauner campaign somehow threatened his employment with the Sun-Times. The timing of this announcement was designed to do maximum possible damage to Rauner by appearing in the press the weekend before early voting starts and prior to the final televised debate. A savvy move that a political strategist would implement.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Despite his paper standing by his flimsy story, this reporter then chooses to <a href="https://davemckinney123.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/mckinney-letter.pdf">publicly resign</a> in an attempt to draw even more attention to his story.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">The resignation letter leaves several unanswered questions. McKinney doesn't reveal how he came across this particular lawsuit in the first place or offer an explanation as to how the Democratic opposition researchers already had it and were planning to proceed with an ad buy around it with or without the Sun Times story. If the Quinn campaign did not feed McKinney the story, why did it take the reporter and editor until October to break the story despite Rauner being a declared candidate for Illinois governor for well over a year? Why does a story like this that has been publicly accessible for years run now, when it would have maximum impact and give the candidate minimum time to respond?</p>
<p data-pnum="13">When I first found out that Dave McKinney was complaining about the Rauner campaign's media tactics, my gut reaction was that he should toughen up, this is the big leagues and reporters, editors and campaign staff should have aggressive behind the scenes arguments on the merits of stories. If you can't take it, get over yourself.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Then, I had a moment of feeling bad for Dave McKinney because his spouse was getting dragged into the tussle. Once I realized who he was married too, I understood the depth of the potential conflict of interest and was irritated that the Sun Times editors didn't reveal the potential conflict in the story. I am not overly concerned that Ms. Liston would personally benefit from the story; but, her professional colleagues might and those relationships are relevant.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Then, McKinney lost any sympathy I had for him when he became a petulant child and threw a fit because someone would dare to have the audacity to question his conflict of interest...when it's what he has been doing for 20 years as a political reporter. How dare anyone suggest that his wife or her contacts in the Democratic media messaging world whose finger prints are all over the Quinn ads had any influence on McKinney's reporting or story selection. How dare we suggest that the timing was suspicious. How dare anyone question the great Dave McKinney.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Not only did he throw a fit, he did so publicly to draw more attention to himself, something journalists take pains to avoid. He is accused of a potential conflict of interest that would help Pat Quinn get re-elected, and then he defends himself...by filing a vague complaint against Bruce Rauner's campaign the weekend before early voting begins, the exact time Democratic media consultants would recommend to go public to do maximum damage to the candidate and influence the outcome of the race in favor of Quinn.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Then, to make sure the story stays alive during early voting, the reporter resigns in a public way to give the story a new 24 hour news cycle.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">I hate to ruin the end of this story for those of you DVRing this show; but, now that McKinney is free from his Sun Times gig, he can continue to stoke the anti-Rauner message in as many TV, print and radio interviews as he possibly can between now and Election Day. It's what any political media strategist with an agenda to influence a race would do.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">I have no sympathy for Dave McKinney. He is a big boy reporter in the political big leagues with the guts to follow his instincts and play hard ball with campaigns. He knew his marriage would raise conflict of interest questions and that no amount of paperwork would ever truly create a firewall between his work and his wife's professional life. He successfully defended his ethics to his editors and not only got them to agree to run the story, but got a boisterous defense of his professionalism from them. Instead of slipping back into the shadows to continue his work, he went out of his way to make himself the subject of the story because he decided he was too good to have to answer conflict of interest questions. His righteous indignation of having anyone dare question the obvious conflict his relationship could present is sickening (especially considering the content of this particular story and the appearance of collaboration with the Quinn campaign on a strategy to use it). He acts like the Rauner camp has it out for any journalist who writes a negative story about him; yet, they have only leveled a conflict of interest allegation against one reporter...because he is the only one with this issue.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">I also have no sympathy for the Chicago Sun Times owners or editors. This story should never have run and they had no business getting back into the endorsement business after declaring they were out of it. The story was thin, had no news value and the editors should have killed it. Period. There are plenty of legitimate, credible stories regarding Bruce Rauner's professional career as an investor and business leader. This was not one of them. It should have been immediately clear to editors that this story was Democrat opposition research fodder for a campaign ad and nothing more. It didn't deserve the credibility of becoming a news story, backed by reputable reporter's byline.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">If you are one of the Democrats who are reading this all the way to the end, having scoffed your way through this post because you think Rauner is a scumbag anyway and even if their was a conflict, Rauner deserved to get side swiped by journalists, I have a warning for you. Do we really want a political environment where journalists work arm-in-arm with campaigns to coordinate messaging and influence elections without consideration of news value? Do we want the referees to decide winners and losers? Democrats might take their chances opening that door in this election; but, don't assume all journalists would take your side in future races. If the umpires decide to pick a side, they are under no obligation to pick yours. We are all better served with them calling balls and strikes rather than trying to run the bases.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Whether or not the story was motivated by partisanship or relationships we may never know, but McKinney's subsequent, deliberate attempts to keep the story going and focus on himself certainly adds to the perception that he wants to influence the outcome of the election. Unfortunately, it appears Dave McKinney started running the bases before he took off his umpire uniform and the Sun Times editors let it happen.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Hopefully, this episode and the story that started it do not influence voter's decision on the race for Illinois governor. Based on the latest <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-illinois-governor-race-met-1023-20141022-story.html#page=1">Chicago Tribune poll</a>, it certainly seems voters, especially women, have dismissed it as part of their decision making process in this race.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Brian Matos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11851:"Dave McKinney, the now former Chicago Sun-Times Springfield Bureau Chief, is married to a very talented Democratic media strategist, Ann Liston.

McKinney doesn't reveal how he came across this particular lawsuit in the first place or offer an explanation as to how the Democratic opposition researchers already had it and were planning to proceed with an ad buy around it with or without the Sun Times story. If the Quinn campaign did not feed McKinney the story, why did it take the reporter and editor until October to break the story despite Rauner being a declared candidate for Illinois governor for well over a year? Why does a story like this that has been publicly accessible for years run now, when it would have maximum impact and give the candidate minimum time to respond?</p>
<p data-pnum="13">When I first found out that Dave McKinney was complaining about the Rauner campaign's media tactics, my gut reaction was that he should toughen up, this is the big leagues and reporters, editors and campaign staff should have aggressive behind the scenes arguments on the merits of stories. If you can't take it, get over yourself.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Then, I had a moment of feeling bad for Dave McKinney because his spouse was getting dragged into the tussle. Once I realized who he was married too, I understood the depth of the potential conflict of interest and was irritated that the Sun Times editors didn't reveal the potential conflict in the story. I am not overly concerned that Ms. Liston would personally benefit from the story; but, her professional colleagues might and those relationships are relevant.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Then, McKinney lost any sympathy I had for him when he became a petulant child and threw a fit because someone would dare to have the audacity to question his conflict of interest...when it's what he has been doing for 20 years as a political reporter. How dare anyone suggest that his wife or her contacts in the Democratic media messaging world whose finger prints are all over the Quinn ads had any influence on McKinney's reporting or story selection. How dare we suggest that the timing was suspicious. How dare anyone question the great Dave McKinney.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Not only did he throw a fit, he did so publicly to draw more attention to himself, something journalists take pains to avoid. He is accused of a potential conflict of interest that would help Pat Quinn get re-elected, and then he defends himself...by filing a vague complaint against Bruce Rauner's campaign the weekend before early voting begins, the exact time Democratic media consultants would recommend to go public to do maximum damage to the candidate and influence the outcome of the race in favor of Quinn.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Then, to make sure the story stays alive during early voting, the reporter resigns in a public way to give the story a new 24 hour news cycle.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">I hate to ruin the end of this story for those of you DVRing this show; but, now that McKinney is free from his Sun Times gig, he can continue to stoke the anti-Rauner message in as many TV, print and radio interviews as he possibly can between now and Election Day. It's what any political media strategist with an agenda to influence a race would do.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">I have no sympathy for Dave McKinney. He is a big boy reporter in the political big leagues with the guts to follow his instincts and play hard ball with campaigns. He knew his marriage would raise conflict of interest questions and that no amount of paperwork would ever truly create a firewall between his work and his wife's professional life. He successfully defended his ethics to his editors and not only got them to agree to run the story, but got a boisterous defense of his professionalism from them. Instead of slipping back into the shadows to continue his work, he went out of his way to make himself the subject of the story because he decided he was too good to have to answer conflict of interest questions. His righteous indignation of having anyone dare question the obvious conflict his relationship could present is sickening (especially considering the content of this particular story and the appearance of collaboration with the Quinn campaign on a strategy to use it). He acts like the Rauner camp has it out for any journalist who writes a negative story about him; yet, they have only leveled a conflict of interest allegation against one reporter...because he is the only one with this issue.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">I also have no sympathy for the Chicago Sun Times owners or editors. This story should never have run and they had no business getting back into the endorsement business after declaring they were out of it. The story was thin, had no news value and the editors should have killed it. Period. There are plenty of legitimate, credible stories regarding Bruce Rauner's professional career as an investor and business leader. This was not one of them. It should have been immediately clear to editors that this story was Democrat opposition research fodder for a campaign ad and nothing more. It didn't deserve the credibility of becoming a news story, backed by reputable reporter's byline.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">If you are one of the Democrats who are reading this all the way to the end, having scoffed your way through this post because you think Rauner is a scumbag anyway and even if their was a conflict, Rauner deserved to get side swiped by journalists, I have a warning for you. Do we really want a political environment where journalists work arm-in-arm with campaigns to coordinate messaging and influence elections without consideration of news value? Do we want the referees to decide winners and losers? Democrats might take their chances opening that door in this election; but, don't assume all journalists would take your side in future races. If the umpires decide to pick a side, they are under no obligation to pick yours. We are all better served with them calling balls and strikes rather than trying to run the bases.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Whether or not the story was motivated by partisanship or relationships we may never know, but McKinney's subsequent, deliberate attempts to keep the story going and focus on himself certainly adds to the perception that he wants to influence the outcome of the election. Unfortunately, it appears Dave McKinney started running the bases before he took off his umpire uniform and the Sun Times editors let it happen.</p>
<p data-pnum="13">Hopefully, this episode and the story that started it do not influence voter's decision on the race for Illinois governor. Based on the latest <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-illinois-governor-race-met-1023-20141022-story.html#page=1">Chicago Tribune poll</a>, it certainly seems voters, especially women, have dismissed it as part of their decision making process in this race.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

The Libertarian Party candidate, Chad Grimm, is the only third party candidate who made it on the ballot for Illinois governor this year. Pat Quinn's campaign successfully knocked the Green Party candidate off the ballot. Thus, for voters who have grown to dislike both major party candidates, there is only one person on the ballot who can get all the protest votes. In a close race, where the consequences of the outcome are monumental and the future course of the state hangs in the balance, there is no excuse for protest votes. We have an incumbent and one credible alternative. A vote for anyone else in this case, is a tacit, reckless endorsement of the status quo.

Chad Grimm is one of the least qualified people to ever seek high office in Illinois. Scott Lee Cohen holds that title for now, but Grimm is not far behind. Grimm has no meaningful leadership experience of any kind in business, society, politics or community. He previously ran for office in his hometown of Peoria and was rejected by the voters who know him best...twice. His only real talent seems to be amateur level acting, which explains why he wants to draw attention to himself despite having nothing important to say. His own campaign website doesn't bother to articulate his position on any important issue. In media interviews and op-eds, he says he will end state pensions for workers, but doesn't explain how. He told Chicago Magazine that he would close various state agencies; but, failed to name one example. His distinguishing issues seem to be that he is pro-life (though doesn't explain what they means) and he will legalize marijuana in Illinois (doesn't get into specifics). Because apparently abortion and weed are far bigger challenges in Illinois than upside down budgets, terrible credit ratings or economic stagnation?

This is not a serious campaign and Grimm is not worthy of a single vote in this particular race. He offers no meaningful ideas, no practical solutions and no bold, new proposals. I have nothing against the Illinois Libertarian Party, but if you are going to run a candidate for governor, at least make sure they have qualifications, a platform and a rationale. It would also help if they were a real libertarian.

For as awful a candidate as Chad Grimm is, he is not the real problem. Anyone who votes for him is.

In theory, anyone who is in the 7% who say they will vote for Grimm are opposed to the status quo and do not support Pat Quinn as governor. A majority of the state seems to be in agreement that Quinn is not worthy of another term. However, those 7% want to vote for an alternative and for whatever reason, Bruce Rauner does not appeal to them.

I believe in Bruce Rauner's potential to dramatically change the course of public policy and governance in Illinois for the better. I will go into more detail in the coming weeks as to why I believe in Bruce, especially as a young person. For now, I understand that Rauner still needs to sell himself to those disgruntled voters who don't want Pat Quinn but would rather lodge a protest vote than vote for him. I hope he is persuasive in tonight's debate and upcoming public appearances.

Let's make one thing clear: voting for Grimm is not a protest vote. It's a vote for Pat Quinn.

There is a reason the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/10/libertarian-chad-grimm-pulls-in-30k-from-iuoe-local-150.html">donated </a>$30,000 to him. Grimm might as well be a Pat Quinn union guy.

Bruce Rauner is the only viable alternative to Pat Quinn in this race. Grimm, and curmudgeons like him, pout when they claim that there is no difference between Quinn and Rauner. The truth is that there is a world of difference between the incumbent who will sell out the state's future to present day union bosses/special interest groups and a political outsider who is thinking about how to put public unions/special interests in their place and get them out of the way of economic growth for the future. There is a huge difference between a corrupt, life long politician who hires political workers into state jobs and hands out taxpayer dollars to political allies and a businessman who has dedicated his life to growing businesses so that the middle class has more opportunities to be honorably hired into the work force. Quinn stands for restricting school choice while Rauner wants every child to have a fair chance at a life-changing education. If Grimm can't recognize the difference, it's because he isn't paying attention.

Bruce Rauner is a real break from the past and the polar opposite of Pat Quinn and his policies.

Chad Grimm is not a viable alternative to Quinn, not only because he has no chance of winning, but because he offers no alternative vision for Illinois. Any votes for Grimm are simply cynical people voting to accept the status quo out of a sense of misguided hopelessness. It is not a vote for change, for a new vision or for reform. Quinn's votes are coming from the politically connected who use government as an ATM to rip off the unconnected and enrich themselves at the expense of the common man or woman. Those of us who do not hold such selfish views and want shared prosperity can not afford to split our votes, we have to focus them on one candidate so we can overcome the united Democratic front.

For pro-life voters who are frustrated that Bruce Rauner has marginalized the issue of abortion in his campaign and buy Grimm's self proclaimed pro-life illusion, ask yourself this: If voting for Grimm costs Rauner votes and helps get hardcore pro-choice Pat Quinn re-elected, why would you want to caste a vote that has the effect of helping Pat Quinn expand public access for elective abortions? Further, what does Grimm mean by pro-life? Is he opposed to abortions in all cases, including rape and incest? Would he seek prosecution of physicians who perform abortions? What specific legislation or executive actions does he support to restrict access to or public funding of abortions? Or is Grimm a deceptive, opportunist putting on an act to lure cultural conservative votes away from Pat Quinn's real challenger?

Bruce Rauner may not be the top choice for cultural conservatives; but, he is a lot better than the alternative, Pat Quinn. Of the two choices we have, Rauner is clearly more inline with conservative principles. It is better to vote for someone you generally agree with than to throw away your vote on a charlatan and help someone who primarily advocates views completely opposite of your own.

Voting for Chad Grimm is voting against the only person in this race who can offer Illinois some glimmer of hope, Bruce Rauner.

If you are thinking about voting for Grimm, please visit his website, search his media interviews and do your homework on him. I know you will find that he is a hollow, empty, joke of a candidate unworthy of your valuable support. Take another look at Bruce Rauner. Watch the upcoming debates, read his policy initiatives and spend some time on his website. If you still can't bring yourself to fully support him by Election Day, consider casting your protest vote against Quinn for him instead of Chad Grimm. At least your vote will go toward a highly qualified leader who has a vision and a plan.

Bruce Rauner is the only real alternative to Pat Quinn.

It will be embarrassing enough if our state re-elects Quinn. Let's not humiliate ourselves any further by having him win by a plurality because frustrated citizens lodged protest votes for the unqualified guy who ran for governor without a plan as some kind of sick prank.

This offensive and disgraceful smear is a conversation ender that the American left has dispatched countless times when debating their political opposition, even on issues totally unrelated to race. It's also a phrase casually bantered about in liberal social circles.

The first part of the phrase is meant to soften the blow of the subsequent insult; but, the overall message behind the phrase is clear: Republicans either are racist or tolerate racism.

Calling someone, or an entire group, racist should never be done casually or without careful consideration. It is a deeply hurtful accusation to throw at people who have no overt or subconscious racial bias or prejudice. As Republicans, we pride ourselves on toughness and not allowing ourselves to be easily offended. In this case, we can not allow such slander to simply slide off our backs.

Engaging in an exercise of social division, condescending liberals attempt to paint all Republicans as dumb, racist, sexist, misogynist and uncaring.  Each allegation is as offensive as the one before.

I am not suggesting there aren't bigots who wave the Republican banner. However, I am declaring that narrow minded discriminators exist in all political movements and proudly display their allegiance to Democrats as well.

If you don't want to take my word for it, spend an evening at a Teamsters or municipal workers union member meeting. Some of the most disgusting, racist, sexist words I have ever personally heard uttered came from the swearing mouths of hardcore, third generation Chicago union members who have never voted for a Republican in their life and would rather eat dirt than start now.

Such verbal filth doesn't just come from the stereotypical working class guy drinking too many beers with his boys. It also comes in a more subtle form from the mouths of upper, middle income parents who firmly believe in the economic and social policies of liberal Democrats; but, tell their children to lock their doors in the grocery store parking lot when a black teenager walks by.

Racism isn't limited to words, either. Plenty of Chicago's most politically active liberals are the same people I see clutching their purse a little tighter when they walk past a pair of Hispanic men. I notice Chicago's "lakefront liberals" and city employees move to neighborhoods miles from the heart of the city, where almost no non-white families live. Chicago and many other big cities did not have large Republican electorates during the "white flight" years of  the 1950s, 60s,70s and early 80s. Even today, Democratic households are moving into the suburbs and you'd have to be naive to think that has no correlation to the movement of non-white residents away from the city center into traditionally western European neighborhoods.

And as for homophobia, some of the ugliest words uttered at gay men come from the pulpits of historically black churches and Hispanic and Irish Catholic Church alters. These Christian church pews are full of generations worth of loyal Democratic voters; yet, they nod along as gay men are called "abominations" who are "condemned to hell."

The hard truth is that racism, sexism, homophobia and intolerance of all types existed and exists in both major American political parties. Unfortunately, the bigots who seem to be the loudest, most embarrassing and best at grabbing the spotlight are Republicans. Sadly, when they spew their intolerant views, there are Democrat voters quietly nodding along with their Republican rivals.

So why do Democrats ignore the racists in their ranks and exploit the presence of racists in ours? Partially because we allow them to and partially because Democrats look for excuses to avoid engaging in real political dialogue.

Republican self pride keeps many of us from expressing how deeply offensive liberal accusations are to us. We don't like to bitch and moan about political correctness or ask our political foes to temper their words. That needs to change. We can not allow slanderous statements like the one I used to start this post go unchecked. Just because someone believes in limited government and maximum individual liberty does not mean he/she is prejudiced or hateful toward any group. Just because someone has a GOP bumper sticker does not mean they have a loaded rifle in the back seat next to a Bible. These are ugly stereotypes, a word the American left supposedly reviles.

Just as with any other group of close minded people, liberals that choose to slander are simply fearful of those whom they do not understand or disagree with. Liberal commentators and comedians alike often choose to throw salacious charges at conservatives simply because they are tired of debating the issues of taxation rates, deficit spending, healthcare reform, government programs, education reform, gun rights or national security among others. If a liberal can't understand why someone, who has had different experiences than their own, would disagree with them on a topic, they simply manufacture and assign a fanatical motive onto their opponent to explain it away.

Both sides name-call and hit below the belt in America's never ending political drama. However, only die hard lefties proclaim themselves free of all bias and prejudice only to turn around and stereotype their opponents. They bestow upon themselves a position of intellectual superiority that allows them to justify their ugly caricaturing of Republicans. Liberal proclamation of "moral superiority" only adds to the smugness inherit in their riffs.

There is no justification for falsely accusing people of things for which they are not guilty.

Bigotry and intolerance is wrong. Racism is wrong. Sexism is wrong. Homophobia is wrong.

So is classifying your political opponent as any of those things as a cheap way out of a real discussion.

This offensive and disgraceful smear is a conversation ender that the American left has dispatched countless times when debating their political opposition, even on issues totally unrelated to race. It's also a phrase casually bantered about in liberal social circles.

The first part of the phrase is meant to soften the blow of the subsequent insult; but, the overall message behind the phrase is clear: Republicans either are racist or tolerate racism.

Calling someone, or an entire group, racist should never be done casually or without careful consideration. It is a deeply hurtful accusation to throw at people who have no overt or subconscious racial bias or prejudice. As Republicans, we pride ourselves on toughness and not allowing ourselves to be easily offended. In this case, we can not allow such slander to simply slide off our backs.

Engaging in an exercise of social division, condescending liberals attempt to paint all Republicans as dumb, racist, sexist, misogynist and uncaring.  Each allegation is as offensive as the one before.

I am not suggesting there aren't bigots who wave the Republican banner. However, I am declaring that narrow minded discriminators exist in all political movements and proudly display their allegiance to Democrats as well.

If you don't want to take my word for it, spend an evening at a Teamsters or municipal workers union member meeting. Some of the most disgusting, racist, sexist words I have ever personally heard uttered came from the swearing mouths of hardcore, third generation Chicago union members who have never voted for a Republican in their life and would rather eat dirt than start now.

Such verbal filth doesn't just come from the stereotypical working class guy drinking too many beers with his boys. It also comes in a more subtle form from the mouths of upper, middle income parents who firmly believe in the economic and social policies of liberal Democrats; but, tell their children to lock their doors in the grocery store parking lot when a black teenager walks by.

Racism isn't limited to words, either. Plenty of Chicago's most politically active liberals are the same people I see clutching their purse a little tighter when they walk past a pair of Hispanic men. I notice Chicago's "lakefront liberals" and city employees move to neighborhoods miles from the heart of the city, where almost no non-white families live. Chicago and many other big cities did not have large Republican electorates during the "white flight" years of  the 1950s, 60s,70s and early 80s. Even today, Democratic households are moving into the suburbs and you'd have to be naive to think that has no correlation to the movement of non-white residents away from the city center into traditionally western European neighborhoods.

And as for homophobia, some of the ugliest words uttered at gay men come from the pulpits of historically black churches and Hispanic and Irish Catholic Church alters. These Christian church pews are full of generations worth of loyal Democratic voters; yet, they nod along as gay men are called "abominations" who are "condemned to hell."

The hard truth is that racism, sexism, homophobia and intolerance of all types existed and exists in both major American political parties. Unfortunately, the bigots who seem to be the loudest, most embarrassing and best at grabbing the spotlight are Republicans. Sadly, when they spew their intolerant views, there are Democrat voters quietly nodding along with their Republican rivals.

So why do Democrats ignore the racists in their ranks and exploit the presence of racists in ours? Partially because we allow them to and partially because Democrats look for excuses to avoid engaging in real political dialogue.

Republican self pride keeps many of us from expressing how deeply offensive liberal accusations are to us. We don't like to bitch and moan about political correctness or ask our political foes to temper their words. That needs to change. We can not allow slanderous statements like the one I used to start this post go unchecked.

We argue about the big things (defense and economic policies) and the small things (defining modern Conservatism in the U.S.A.). Sometimes, our squabbles spill out in the open, forcing Republican primary voters to settle the debates. Due to the size and diversity of our country, we are even susceptible to regional splits, where Republicans in one state or city have a different platform and agenda than those another state or small town. We even end up having Republican governors who disagree with each other about policy prescriptions for their states as well as state parties who rebel against Republican National Committee positions.

One of the biggest challenges and internal debates we face is an ideological paradox: how can you be hostile to government if you are seeking to be elected into the government? If you are elected to office, will you actually vote to strip yourself of the governing powers that you blast as an outsider?

Conservatives, by any definition you wrap around the term, believe in a policy of limited government interference in the economy, limited taxation, balanced budgets and a light touch approach to regulation. We generally believe that the nature of government (at any level) is self serving for those in charge, inflexible, slow, stagnant, unresponsive and extremely prone to abuse and corruption. While government serves important functions such as providing for the common defense of the nation and administering the judicial system, it can be easily manipulated to enrich a small group of unscrupulous benefactors at the expense of the masses. Conservatives believe that the best way to prevent widespread government abuse of power and economic manipulation is to ensure that government never amasses enough centralized power to carry it out on a large scale.

This political philosophy can easily be turned into a governing philosophy, full of specific policy recommendations with clear goals for improving the American quality of life. However, many activists have a core belief system that is hostile to government in all its forms. This leads to the awkward situation of candidates winning an election in which they railed against the ills of government...but then became part of the government they don't like very much. If you were a die hard, anti-government conservative, chances are you would not be running for office. If I hate pickles, I don't apply for a job at a company that packages them. Yet, some do.

Thus, there will always be tension between limited government, conservative activists and the candidates they support for office. An activist never has to be part of government institutions and can throw rocks from the sideline forever, even turning against their own party officials. Meanwhile, elected conservatives who assume office become part of the government and swear an oath to govern in the best interests of the people they serve. An activist can settle for incoherent rhetoric; but, an elected official actually has a responsibility to govern.

How does the party of limited government come up with a governing philosophy that anti-government activists and supporters can get behind?

This is the real test that faces every Republican elected official in the country. At the state and county level, the GOP seems to have answered that question to the satisfaction of many Conservatives. Despite limited national appeal in Presidential elections, the GOP has 29 sitting governors, 45 sitting U.S. Senators, a majority in the House of Representatives and 28 Republican controlled legislatures, with a handful of those being GOP super-majorities.

When Republicans demonstrate that they can govern and have a philosophy for how to do that, they can succeed. Yet, the national party has not done a very good job articulating a governing philosophy recently. They have allowed a fringe group of anti-government activists to get elected into seats they don't even want as part of a government system they despise. The 2014 primary election cycle has finally broken that trend of running candidates who don't know how to govern and don't care to learn.

If the Republicans become the majority party in the Senate and hold their majority in the House, they will have two years to demonstrate to the country that they are capable of governing. Even if President Obama vetoes three quarters of all the bills sent to his desk from Congress, there will be value for the country if the bills have substance and attempt to address national problems.

If 2014 goes well for the conservative movement in Congress, Republican officials will need to prove they are more than anti-government disciples, just as GOP governors and state legislators have been doing for the past few years. If a cohesive conservative agenda can be presented to the American people in 2016 and a strong leader with the skills to put that agenda into policy wins the party's nomination, the future will be very bright for the country and our party.

That can only happen if conservative activists of all backgrounds come together behind their candidates and elected officials. It's time to leave behind the empty rhetoric of talk shows and take up the grown up task of creating a governing philosophy to guide new public policy. If we want to make life better for everyone in our country, we must commit ourselves to the governing process so we can reshape our institutions into something our whole country can be proud of.
