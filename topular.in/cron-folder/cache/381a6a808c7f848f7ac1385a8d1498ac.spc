Today, we can utter that beautiful four-word phrase, "pitchers and catchers report". Spring Training officially opens today for the White Sox.

Of course lots of players have already been there for days or weeks, so this is just the nominal opening which receives ceremonial focus. Like Christopher Columbus "discovering" America, the players who arrive today aren't really first on any factual basis, but a holiday is a holiday. Credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewSmithBR" target="_blank">Matthew Smith</a> for the photo capturing the spirit of the moment in Columbus' facial expression, as he arrived at Camelback Ranch only to realize who's in right field.

As a White Sox fan, you may be inundated with Spring Training primers and previews from every beat writer and blog on the block. So we're giving you a different angle - a preview of what to watch in Spring Training as it pertains to prospects and minor leaguers. If you want a more overall view, there will be plenty of choices - <a href="http://www.thecatbirdseatblog.com/blog/2016/2/18/your-2016-white-sox-spring-training-primer" target="_blank">here is a good one from The Catbird Seat</a>, one of our favorite general Sox blogs.

One more general note: we will have multiple writers at Camelback this spring at various times, taking video, photos and notes from the ballpark and the back fields. So look for that content over the next six weeks or so.

Here are the prospects and recent/current minor leaguers who were invited to major league camp but aren't definitely slotted for the active roster, and what to watch for for each of them. Some of them may not technically be prospects anymore (i.e. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=johnser04,johnser03&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erik Johnson</a>), but can essentially be treated as such for the purposes of the team view. I've broken them up into three categories.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PLAYERS ON THE 40-MAN ROSTER</strong></span>

<strong>RHP Erik Johnson:</strong> Vying for the 5th starter slot, though he's probably well behind <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/latosma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mat Latos</a> (and his major league deal) for that job and is competing with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/turneja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jacob Turner</a>Â (who is out of options) as well. Prior to Latos signing he looked like a lock for the job, now not so much. He's one of the few here truly competing for an Opening Day role, and for him the key is about whether he can carry over his big improvements from 2015. We'll see that pretty quickly once he pitches in games, and he's one of the key guys to watch in March. When he's his 2015 self, he looks like a major league, back end starter.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/beckch02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chris Beck</a>:</strong> Unlikely to make the club out of the gate, but there's a good chance you'll see him in Chicago sometime in 2016. Beck's floor is high as a worm-burning, innings-eating role pitcher who also could be a back end starter. The wildcard is his Ulnar Nerve Translocation surgery and missed time in 2015 that caused him to miss more than half the season, and it's not clear if his arm will be ready for a full year of starting workload. So keep an eye on his innings, velocity and level of rust, if any. The bullpen could be an option as well, where his power sinker and change-up combo should play, possibly as a long man.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/carrosc02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scott Carroll</a>:</strong> Similar in potential role to Beck, Carroll has proven he can provide major league innings and has potential value starting or in the bullpen. In terms of the depth chart, Carroll is probably behind two or three pitchers for a rotation spot, and a similar number in the pen. That makes the latter much more likely. With Carroll you pretty much know what you're going to get, so he just needs to stay healthy and hope for an opportunity.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kahnlto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy Kahnle</a>:</strong> The White Sox traded a decent pitching prospect (<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=almont000yen&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yency Almonte</a>) for this reliever and put him on the 40-man roster, so this isn't just a filler pickup. The club saw something causing his control issues that they think they can fix, and he's very much in the mix for a bullpen spot (especially if they carry 8 relievers). Watch his command and how he works the strike zone - if he's throwing strikes and staying in the lower half of the zone, that's a sign he's taken to the intended changes.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/webbda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Webb</a>:</strong> Like Kahnle, Webb has major league experience and tantalizing stuff, but has had trouble putting it together at the major league level. He's also competing for a bullpen role with the big club, and probably very close to (though perhaps just behind) Kahnle going in. Yet another similarity is the relationship with the strike zone - when Webb is throwing his upper 90's gas in the zone, everything else plays up and he's effective. So keep an eye on where he's placing his pitches.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/phillza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zach Phillips</a>:</strong> Placed on the 40-man roster just before the Rule 5 Draft, Phillips is part of the lefty specialist depth the club is trying to build. If <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jennida01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dan Jennings</a> struggles, Phillips is likely the next best option. The 28-year old hasn't been in the majors since 2013, but he was quite effective in AAA Charlotte in 2015, especially against left-handed batters (.556 OPS, .213 AVG despite a .341 BABIP against him). He just needs to show he can get outs in lefty-lefty scenarios, and wait for someone faltering above him.

<strong>UTIL <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/garcile02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leury Garcia</a>:</strong> His value is wound up in speed, and the ability to play passable or better defense at nearly any position on the field. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=sanchca01,sanche012car,sanche009car&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Sanchez</a> is pretty much guaranteed the utility infielder role, so Garcia is playing for a 4th bench slot (if they even use one), and he's got competition there as you'll see. He put up some nice hitting numbers in AAA in 2015, but hasn't shown anything like that in the majors, so can he hit? That's what he needs to show in Arizona to have a shot.

<strong>3B <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/oltmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mike Olt</a>:</strong> This fallen prospect was one in the parade of attempts to find a starting third baseman for the major league club in 2015, a problem now solved with the acquisition of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/frazito01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Todd Frazier</a>. Olt is also competing for that final bench spot, but he can really only play corner infield (with struggles) and hasn't shown much at the plate. He'd have to have a big spring on both sides of the ball to be on the plane to Chicago come April.

<strong>3B <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davidma02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matt Davidson</a>:</strong> In theory, Davidson is in the running for a bench slot. But with at most one of those jobs open to him (Sanchez, the backup catcher and a 4th OF already spoken for) and the fact that he struck out in more than 30% of his plate appearances in this 3rd trip through AAA, the chances are very slim. This spring is really about one thing for Matt - showing he can make use of his substantial power by making consistent contact. If he does that, and carries it to Charlotte, he might have a shot to revive his prospect stock.

<strong>Catchers <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brantro01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rob Brantly</a> and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=smith-006kev&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kevan Smith</a>:</strong> Neither are getting a job on Opening Day barring an injury; but as both the slated major league catchers have some history of that, so which of these two shows they're the next man up is worth monitoring. For Smith, while his defense has improved he struggled at the plate for the first time as a pro in 2015 at AAA. So watch how he's looking in the batter's box. For Brantly, the questions are more about defense, and whether his relative success at the plate in the minors (and previously, in the majors) can return at the highest level. It's hard to handicap this race, with both likely in Charlotte again, but there's a third catcher in this mix that we'll discuss later.

<strong>Outfielders <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sandsje01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jerry Sands</a> andÂ <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fieldda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Fields</a>:</strong> With <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/garciav01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avisail Garcia</a> remaining in the starting right fielder role by default, the opening day competition in the outfield appears to be about the 4th OF role - maybe even a 5th, or a platoon partner. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/shuckja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">J.B. Shuck</a> has the inside track, but these two (along with prospects we'll discuss later) are all in the running and the team might even carry five outfielders. Sands has shown big power in the minors to go along with some contact issues, so what he shows in bat-to-ball skills is key for him. Fields is known more for his defense and speed, so watch how well he can work at-bats for an indicator of his ability to get on base.

<strong>RHP's <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=brenna001bra&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brandon Brennan</a> and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=ynoa--001mic&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Michael Ynoa</a>:</strong> They're on the 40-man for protective reasons and aren't a threat to make the major league club yet, neither having pitched above A-ball. They've both had health issues, but both have flashed legit stuff as well (elite stuff even, in Ynoa's case), so it's really just about making sure they're healthy and ready for AA in 2016.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NON-ROSTER INVITEES - PROSPECTS</strong></span>

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/carson-fulmer/">Carson Fulmer</a>:</strong> Don't expect Fulmer to go the way of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodonca01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Rodon</a>. While both are/were highly considered pitching prospects that the White Sox expect to be future mainstays in the rotation, Rodon's quick ascension was truly uncommon and probably a stretch for Fulmer. Carson could see Chicago at some point in 2016, but he's likely headed for the rotation in AA Birmingham to open the season. What to watch for in Spring Training: mostly his command and refinement, to get a sense of how far away he might be.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=danish000tyl&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tyler Danish</a>:</strong> Danish will also likely head for the Southern League come April, and he's not making the major league club out of Arizona, and probably not in 2016 at all. 2015 saw him experience his first struggles as the youngest starting pitcher in his league, and his unorthodox delivery and stuff may get a little more tweaking from the Sox staff. Watch his fastball velocity and more importantly, the movement on all his pitches. Consistent dance moves are what you want to see from Danish, and for him to throw strikes with confidence despite hitting a speed bump last season.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=guerre004jor&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jordan Guerrero</a>:</strong> Like Danish, Guerrero is not vying for a spot in the majors. But he's had two straight seasons of notable improvement, elevating him to Top 10 prospect status. The lefty has good command of his full repertoire including a plus change-up and curveball that shows above average when he's on. The thing to watch with Jordan is the quality of his fastball, in velocity and movement. He needs to stay low 90's with it and give it some tail to be effective. It's also worth watching his health, as he's doubled his innings load in each of those two seasons.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=tago--001pet&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Peter Tago</a>:</strong> From minor league phase Rule 5 pickup through a gut retooling to legit reliever prospect, Tago had quite a 2015. And he's got an outside chance at a bullpen role on the 25-man roster, though more likely he's headed for the upper minors with a shot at a job later in the season. Petey Pistola (as his Twitter handle advertises) made huge strides in command last season but that fell back a bit in the AFL, so watch how well he can command the zone in his appearances. That's his key.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=lamb--000wil&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Will Lamb</a>:</strong> Acquired in exchange for pitching prospect <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=jaye--001myl&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Myles Jaye</a>, Lamb isn't as highly considered as a prospect but has a higher floor as a potential lefty specialist reliever. His splits are dramatic and he's very good against lefties. While two major leaguers and Zach Phillips are likely ahead of him right now, he could see the big league roster later this year. Same story for Lamb as Phillips in the desert: he needs to show how effective he can be against LHB.

<strong>SS <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=anders003tim&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tim Anderson</a>:</strong> Despite the calls from some corners and the tantalizing potential we all see in Anderson, he's not likely to get the starting job at short on Opening Day and that's likely best. He's still quite young, improved but not yet polished at short, and his aggressiveness at the plate means he would likely struggle against major league pitching. What he needs is a year in AAA against refined arms, where he can be challenged and continue developing his impressive raw tools. What to watch for: his comfort level at shortstop, and his patience and pitch selection at the plate.

<strong>C <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=narvae001---&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Omar Narvaez</a>:</strong> Another Rule 5 minor league pickup, Narvaez isn't leaving Arizona with the White Sox but he's a prospect worth monitoring. With good defensive skills, a strong arm and some of the best plate discipline numbers in the organization, keep an eye on how Omar looks handling pitchers and whether or not he's overwhelmed by major league pitching. He's here to show he belongs on the long-term chart.

<strong>Outfielders <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=may---002---&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jacob May</a>, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=engel-000ada&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Engel</a>, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=hawkin000cou&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Courtney Hawkins</a> and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=coats-000jas&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jason Coats</a>:</strong> That's four prospects with major league ceilings, though also four very different agendas in Glendale. May is looking to re-start the clock after his concussion recovery and struggles to get back on track in 2015, and he's here to show the hit tool is still there and maybe add some walks or show a little more pop. Engel is a plus-plus runner and strong outfielder who broke out in late 2015, but his hit tool puts him a year or two away from the bigs more than likely (barring a September call-up as a speed weapon). Coats is the least flashy of the bunch, but he does almost everything well and is probably the most major league-ready of this foursome right now. Hawkins is furthest away from MLB-ready, and is looking to improve his floor by showing better plate discipline and pitch recognition.

A quick added note about those four outfielders. If Avisail Garcia continues to struggle, he likely doesn't last the full season in a starting role. Shuck isn't seen as a starting option. Sands and Fields appear closest to the majors but look more like role players, possibly in a platoon and not a starting role. And while May and Engel are getting a lot of attention in the media as possible guys to step up in 2016, I'd say it's Coats who might be most likely to get a crack at it in the shorter term, if it's a full-on in-house replacement. He's got an unusual combination of good contact skills and power, plays very good corner OF defense with a strong and accurate arm and can cover center, has above average speed and was hitting AAA pitching effectively by mid-season despite virtually skipping AA.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NON-ROSTER INVITEES - RINGERS &amp; RECLAMATIONS</strong></span>

*Quick overall note for all the below - none of them are realistic options to make the major league opening roster, but all have different missions and a couple could see the majors during the season.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aumonph01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phillippe Aumont</a>:</strong> Reclamation station. The once highly-touted pitching prospect hasn't been able to throw strikes let alone command his pitches in four years, but the stuff flashes nasty enough features that teams will keep giving him chances. Classic "Coop will fix 'em" pickup who needs to show some progress in command.

His fastball has been near triple digits at times and his slider has been previously called "nasty" and "hard-biting". He actually put up good numbers in AAA last year, so it's hard to call him a reclamation project, so maybe he's more the hope of a diamond in the rough. Seeing major league time in 2016 isn't out of the question.

So in this case the club might see a potential specialist. Turley was drafted in the 50th round in 2008.

He'll be in competition with Kevan Smith and Rob Brantly for the two jobs in Charlotte, though if an injury occurs to one of the major leaguers early on, Sanchez' pro experience could give him an edge. Longer term, he's likely the odd man out. Sanchez is definitely in the ringer category.

They also both have limited major league experience where they struggled to hit, and neither show much power or hitting value. These are org depth players.

Today, we can utter that beautiful four-word phrase, "pitchers and catchers report". Spring Training officially opens today for the White Sox.

Of course lots of players have already been there for days or weeks, so this is just the nominal opening which receives ceremonial focus. Like Christopher Columbus "discovering" America, the players who arrive today aren't really first on any factual basis, but a holiday is a holiday. Credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewSmithBR" target="_blank">Matthew Smith</a> for the photo capturing the spirit of the moment in Columbus' facial expression, as he arrived at Camelback Ranch only to realize who's in right field.

As a White Sox fan, you may be inundated with Spring Training primers and previews from every beat writer and blog on the block. So we're giving you a different angle - a preview of what to watch in Spring Training as it pertains to prospects and minor leaguers. If you want a more overall view, there will be plenty of choices - <a href="http://www.thecatbirdseatblog.com/blog/2016/2/18/your-2016-white-sox-spring-training-primer" target="_blank">here is a good one from The Catbird Seat</a>, one of our favorite general Sox blogs.

One more general note: we will have multiple writers at Camelback this spring at various times, taking video, photos and notes from the ballpark and the back fields. So look for that content over the next six weeks or so.

Here are the prospects and recent/current minor leaguers who were invited to major league camp but aren't definitely slotted for the active roster, and what to watch for for each of them. Some of them may not technically be prospects anymore (i.e. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=johnser04,johnser03&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Erik Johnson</a>), but can essentially be treated as such for the purposes of the team view. I've broken them up into three categories.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PLAYERS ON THE 40-MAN ROSTER</strong></span>

<strong>RHP Erik Johnson:</strong> Vying for the 5th starter slot, though he's probably well behind <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/latosma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mat Latos</a> (and his major league deal) for that job and is competing with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/turneja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jacob Turner</a>Â (who is out of options) as well. Prior to Latos signing he looked like a lock for the job, now not so much. He's one of the few here truly competing for an Opening Day role, and for him the key is about whether he can carry over his big improvements from 2015. We'll see that pretty quickly once he pitches in games, and he's one of the key guys to watch in March. When he's his 2015 self, he looks like a major league, back end starter.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/beckch02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chris Beck</a>:</strong> Unlikely to make the club out of the gate, but there's a good chance you'll see him in Chicago sometime in 2016. Beck's floor is high as a worm-burning, innings-eating role pitcher who also could be a back end starter. The wildcard is his Ulnar Nerve Translocation surgery and missed time in 2015 that caused him to miss more than half the season, and it's not clear if his arm will be ready for a full year of starting workload. So keep an eye on his innings, velocity and level of rust, if any. The bullpen could be an option as well, where his power sinker and change-up combo should play, possibly as a long man.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/carrosc02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scott Carroll</a>:</strong> Similar in potential role to Beck, Carroll has proven he can provide major league innings and has potential value starting or in the bullpen. In terms of the depth chart, Carroll is probably behind two or three pitchers for a rotation spot, and a similar number in the pen. That makes the latter much more likely. With Carroll you pretty much know what you're going to get, so he just needs to stay healthy and hope for an opportunity.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kahnlto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy Kahnle</a>:</strong> The White Sox traded a decent pitching prospect (<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=almont000yen&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yency Almonte</a>) for this reliever and put him on the 40-man roster, so this isn't just a filler pickup. The club saw something causing his control issues that they think they can fix, and he's very much in the mix for a bullpen spot (especially if they carry 8 relievers). Watch his command and how he works the strike zone - if he's throwing strikes and staying in the lower half of the zone, that's a sign he's taken to the intended changes.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/webbda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Webb</a>:</strong> Like Kahnle, Webb has major league experience and tantalizing stuff, but has had trouble putting it together at the major league level. He's also competing for a bullpen role with the big club, and probably very close to (though perhaps just behind) Kahnle going in. Yet another similarity is the relationship with the strike zone - when Webb is throwing his upper 90's gas in the zone, everything else plays up and he's effective. So keep an eye on where he's placing his pitches.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/phillza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zach Phillips</a>:</strong> Placed on the 40-man roster just before the Rule 5 Draft, Phillips is part of the lefty specialist depth the club is trying to build. If <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jennida01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dan Jennings</a> struggles, Phillips is likely the next best option. The 28-year old hasn't been in the majors since 2013, but he was quite effective in AAA Charlotte in 2015, especially against left-handed batters (.556 OPS, .213 AVG despite a .341 BABIP against him). He just needs to show he can get outs in lefty-lefty scenarios, and wait for someone faltering above him.

<strong>UTIL <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/garcile02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leury Garcia</a>:</strong> His value is wound up in speed, and the ability to play passable or better defense at nearly any position on the field. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=sanchca01,sanche012car,sanche009car&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Sanchez</a> is pretty much guaranteed the utility infielder role, so Garcia is playing for a 4th bench slot (if they even use one), and he's got competition there as you'll see. He put up some nice hitting numbers in AAA in 2015, but hasn't shown anything like that in the majors, so can he hit? That's what he needs to show in Arizona to have a shot.

<strong>3B <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/oltmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mike Olt</a>:</strong> This fallen prospect was one in the parade of attempts to find a starting third baseman for the major league club in 2015, a problem now solved with the acquisition of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/frazito01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Todd Frazier</a>. Olt is also competing for that final bench spot, but he can really only play corner infield (with struggles) and hasn't shown much at the plate. He'd have to have a big spring on both sides of the ball to be on the plane to Chicago come April.

<strong>3B <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davidma02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matt Davidson</a>:</strong> In theory, Davidson is in the running for a bench slot. But with at most one of those jobs open to him (Sanchez, the backup catcher and a 4th OF already spoken for) and the fact that he struck out in more than 30% of his plate appearances in this 3rd trip through AAA, the chances are very slim. This spring is really about one thing for Matt - showing he can make use of his substantial power by making consistent contact. If he does that, and carries it to Charlotte, he might have a shot to revive his prospect stock.

<strong>Catchers <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brantro01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rob Brantly</a> and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=smith-006kev&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kevan Smith</a>:</strong> Neither are getting a job on Opening Day barring an injury; but as both the slated major league catchers have some history of that, so which of these two shows they're the next man up is worth monitoring. For Smith, while his defense has improved he struggled at the plate for the first time as a pro in 2015 at AAA. So watch how he's looking in the batter's box. For Brantly, the questions are more about defense, and whether his relative success at the plate in the minors (and previously, in the majors) can return at the highest level. It's hard to handicap this race, with both likely in Charlotte again, but there's a third catcher in this mix that we'll discuss later.

<strong>Outfielders <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sandsje01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jerry Sands</a> andÂ <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fieldda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Fields</a>:</strong> With <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/garciav01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avisail Garcia</a> remaining in the starting right fielder role by default, the opening day competition in the outfield appears to be about the 4th OF role - maybe even a 5th, or a platoon partner. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/shuckja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">J.B. Shuck</a> has the inside track, but these two (along with prospects we'll discuss later) are all in the running and the team might even carry five outfielders. Sands has shown big power in the minors to go along with some contact issues, so what he shows in bat-to-ball skills is key for him. Fields is known more for his defense and speed, so watch how well he can work at-bats for an indicator of his ability to get on base.

<strong>RHP's <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=brenna001bra&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brandon Brennan</a> and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=ynoa--001mic&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Michael Ynoa</a>:</strong> They're on the 40-man for protective reasons and aren't a threat to make the major league club yet, neither having pitched above A-ball. They've both had health issues, but both have flashed legit stuff as well (elite stuff even, in Ynoa's case), so it's really just about making sure they're healthy and ready for AA in 2016.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NON-ROSTER INVITEES - PROSPECTS</strong></span>

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/carson-fulmer/">Carson Fulmer</a>:</strong> Don't expect Fulmer to go the way of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodonca01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Rodon</a>. While both are/were highly considered pitching prospects that the White Sox expect to be future mainstays in the rotation, Rodon's quick ascension was truly uncommon and probably a stretch for Fulmer. Carson could see Chicago at some point in 2016, but he's likely headed for the rotation in AA Birmingham to open the season. What to watch for in Spring Training: mostly his command and refinement, to get a sense of how far away he might be.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=danish000tyl&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tyler Danish</a>:</strong> Danish will also likely head for the Southern League come April, and he's not making the major league club out of Arizona, and probably not in 2016 at all. 2015 saw him experience his first struggles as the youngest starting pitcher in his league, and his unorthodox delivery and stuff may get a little more tweaking from the Sox staff. Watch his fastball velocity and more importantly, the movement on all his pitches. Consistent dance moves are what you want to see from Danish, and for him to throw strikes with confidence despite hitting a speed bump last season.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=guerre004jor&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jordan Guerrero</a>:</strong> Like Danish, Guerrero is not vying for a spot in the majors. But he's had two straight seasons of notable improvement, elevating him to Top 10 prospect status. The lefty has good command of his full repertoire including a plus change-up and curveball that shows above average when he's on. The thing to watch with Jordan is the quality of his fastball, in velocity and movement. He needs to stay low 90's with it and give it some tail to be effective. It's also worth watching his health, as he's doubled his innings load in each of those two seasons.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=tago--001pet&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Peter Tago</a>:</strong> From minor league phase Rule 5 pickup through a gut retooling to legit reliever prospect, Tago had quite a 2015. And he's got an outside chance at a bullpen role on the 25-man roster, though more likely he's headed for the upper minors with a shot at a job later in the season. Petey Pistola (as his Twitter handle advertises) made huge strides in command last season but that fell back a bit in the AFL, so watch how well he can command the zone in his appearances. That's his key.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=lamb--000wil&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Will Lamb</a>:</strong> Acquired in exchange for pitching prospect <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=jaye--001myl&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Myles Jaye</a>, Lamb isn't as highly considered as a prospect but has a higher floor as a potential lefty specialist reliever. His splits are dramatic and he's very good against lefties. While two major leaguers and Zach Phillips are likely ahead of him right now, he could see the big league roster later this year. Same story for Lamb as Phillips in the desert: he needs to show how effective he can be against LHB.

<strong>SS <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=anders003tim&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tim Anderson</a>:</strong> Despite the calls from some corners and the tantalizing potential we all see in Anderson, he's not likely to get the starting job at short on Opening Day and that's likely best. He's still quite young, improved but not yet polished at short, and his aggressiveness at the plate means he would likely struggle against major league pitching. What he needs is a year in AAA against refined arms, where he can be challenged and continue developing his impressive raw tools. What to watch for: his comfort level at shortstop, and his patience and pitch selection at the plate.

<strong>C <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=narvae001---&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Omar Narvaez</a>:</strong> Another Rule 5 minor league pickup, Narvaez isn't leaving Arizona with the White Sox but he's a prospect worth monitoring. With good defensive skills, a strong arm and some of the best plate discipline numbers in the organization, keep an eye on how Omar looks handling pitchers and whether or not he's overwhelmed by major league pitching. He's here to show he belongs on the long-term chart.

<strong>Outfielders <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=may---002---&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jacob May</a>, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=engel-000ada&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Engel</a>, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=hawkin000cou&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Courtney Hawkins</a> and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=coats-000jas&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jason Coats</a>:</strong> That's four prospects with major league ceilings, though also four very different agendas in Glendale. May is looking to re-start the clock after his concussion recovery and struggles to get back on track in 2015, and he's here to show the hit tool is still there and maybe add some walks or show a little more pop. Engel is a plus-plus runner and strong outfielder who broke out in late 2015, but his hit tool puts him a year or two away from the bigs more than likely (barring a September call-up as a speed weapon). Coats is the least flashy of the bunch, but he does almost everything well and is probably the most major league-ready of this foursome right now. Hawkins is furthest away from MLB-ready, and is looking to improve his floor by showing better plate discipline and pitch recognition.

A quick added note about those four outfielders. If Avisail Garcia continues to struggle, he likely doesn't last the full season in a starting role. Shuck isn't seen as a starting option. Sands and Fields appear closest to the majors but look more like role players, possibly in a platoon and not a starting role. And while May and Engel are getting a lot of attention in the media as possible guys to step up in 2016, I'd say it's Coats who might be most likely to get a crack at it in the shorter term, if it's a full-on in-house replacement. He's got an unusual combination of good contact skills and power, plays very good corner OF defense with a strong and accurate arm and can cover center, has above average speed and was hitting AAA pitching effectively by mid-season despite virtually skipping AA.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NON-ROSTER INVITEES - RINGERS &amp; RECLAMATIONS</strong></span>

*Quick overall note for all the below - none of them are realistic options to make the major league opening roster, but all have different missions and a couple could see the majors during the season.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aumonph01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phillippe Aumont</a>:</strong> Reclamation station. The once highly-touted pitching prospect hasn't been able to throw strikes let alone command his pitches in four years, but the stuff flashes nasty enough features that teams will keep giving him chances. Classic "Coop will fix 'em" pickup who needs to show some progress in command.

<strong>RHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/walljo02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Josh Wall</a>:</strong> A 28-year old former 2nd rounder who's seen a little bit of time in the majors. His fastball has been near triple digits at times and his slider has been previously called "nasty" and "hard-biting". He actually put up good numbers in AAA last year, so it's hard to call him a reclamation project, so maybe he's more the hope of a diamond in the rough. Seeing major league time in 2016 isn't out of the question.

<strong>LHP <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=purke-001mat&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matt Purke</a>:</strong> A former 1st then 3rd rounder, Purke has been mostly a starter and doesn't show big splits so he's not another LOOGY candidate. He's had health issues, been limited in innings and hasn't put it together performance-wise in his minor league career, so he's in the reclamation category. The club may convert him to relief work.

So in this case the club might see a potential specialist. Turley was drafted in the 50th round in 2008.

He'll be in competition with Kevan Smith and Rob Brantly for the two jobs in Charlotte, though if an injury occurs to one of the major leaguers early on, Sanchez' pro experience could give him an edge. Longer term, he's likely the odd man out. Sanchez is definitely in the ringer category.

They also both have limited major league experience where they struggled to hit, and neither show much power or hitting value. These are org depth players.

<strong>One Chance: Making the most of life</strong>

<strong>By <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/tim-anderson/">Tim Anderson</a></strong>

I was four years old when I picked up my first baseball glove. I played throughout my entire childhood, but I never truly took the time to focus on the game of baseball. For much of the time, I was in love with the game of basketball. As a matter of fact, I took time off from baseball my freshman and sophomore years of high school due to two broken leg injuries.

This time in my life was the lowest point in my sports career. I considered throwing in the towel; I just wanted to be done with baseball and basketball. There were many nights where I sat at home and cried to my parents, because I was so tired of getting injured in basketball. Yet, with the support of my family, I never gave up on myself. I kept fighting through this difficult time, and I was able to take advantage of several great opportunities.

I still remember my first baseball game after recovering from my injuries. It was my junior year of high school, and I was told I would only play defense, in left field. I wasn't even in the batting line-up; the pitcher hit for me. As the season progressed, I worked my way up to hitting in the ninth spot. All in all, I finished my junior year with a pretty good season.

Going into my senior year, I was excited for basketball to begin. I earned the starting point guard position at Hillcrest High School. I was so dedicated to basketball that I ended up missing the first half of the baseball season so that I could help my team win the 6A Basketball State Championship. When basketball season came to an end, I went back out to baseball. I had another satisfying season as the starting second baseman.

Toward the end of the season, a friend of mine mentioned my name to the head coach of East Central Community College, Coach Neil Holliman. Coach Holliman came out to see me play numerous times and gave me the opportunity to further my career by playing under him at ECCC.

My freshman year at East Central, I earned the starting spot at shortstop. I ended my first year with 30 stolen bases, a .360 batting average, and 4 home runs. That summer is when I really had a chance to make a name for myself. I had an awesome summer playing in Kansas for the Dodge City A's in the Jayhawk League. There I put up really decent stats.

My sophomore year was such a blessing. It was unreal; I felt like every time I stepped up to the plate, I got a hit. After my first two games where I went 7 for 8 with 3 homers, I knew that I had a real chance to make baseball the sport of my future. I finished my sophomore year at East Central with a .495 batting average and 41 stolen bases.

Overall, there were many rough days at East Central with Coach Holliman; yet, hands down, I can give him all of the credit for my success, even today. He saw potential in me. He molded me to become the man I am today. Each and every day, he pushed me to the max. He would always ask me, "How good do you want to be, son?" The two years I spent with Coach Holliman and the East Central Warriors were the best and toughest years of my life.

After my second year at East Central in June 2013, I was drafted by the White Sox in the first round as the 17th overall pick. That one day alone changed my life forever. Two years before, if someone would have told me I was going to be chosen in the draft, I would have laughed hysterically. I can honestly say the route that got me here was not an easy one at all. I fought through so much adversity just to get where I am now. It's truly a blessing.

Stepping into professional baseball, I have learned many meaningful lessons on and off the field. I have learned that you must always remain focused on your dreams, even if that means losing friends, or even family. There are going to be bad nights, but you have a chance to come out the next day and dominate. Whenever I step onto the baseball diamond, I always play as though I have a chip on my shoulder.

I see and hear all the mix of opinions on my position at shortstop: "he's not a shortstop" and "he needs to be moved to the outfield." These things keep me motivated. They keep me hungry. Everyday I'm Â inspired to prove everyone wrong. I have been given this one opportunity, and I will do everything I can to take full advantage. After all, one chance, one opportunity, is all it really takes to be all that you can be.

They see other teams throwing money around in the Caribbean like they've got a printing press, while the White Sox rarely seem to even be in the conversation.

Some of this is a problem of perception - the Sox have increased their spending on amateur talent both domestically and in Latin America. But it is true that there are a select few ballclubs that have decided to spend many times over as much as many of their cohorts in order to bring in waves of talented prospects. With the South Siders struggling to win at the major league level, and a farm system that has improved but hasn't been in the top half in over a decade, the natives are restless.

Does going over limits and taking on penalties to sign a big wave of teenage talent really make sense? Would the White Sox even consider it? Is now the time?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Quick Primer</strong></span>

Let's start with the structure. Players from outside the United States (and it's territories) who wish to play here are split into two categories. Those over 23 years of age and with 5+ years' professional experience are free agents and can sign with any team without restrictions from the American side. Those who don't meet that bar are subject to a set of rules around an annual signing cycle, beginning each July 2nd and running until the next June (there is a "quiet period" a few weeks before July 2nd). Players need to be at least 16 years old or turn 16 by September of the year the period begins to be eligible.

Teams are given a dollar figure that represents their "pool" for spending in this latter, generally amateur market. If a team goes over that pool by up to 5%, they pay a 100% "tax" penalty on the overage amount. If they go over by 5-10%, they get taxed and cannot sign a player for over $500,000 in the next signing period. If they go over by 10-15%, it's a $300,000 cap the next period. Finally, if they go more than 15% over, they cannot sign a player for over $300,000 the next <em>two</em> signing periods, and of course are subject to that tax. That last bracket involves a heavy price to pay.

As you can see, while the system discourages teams from going over, it also encourages teams to go way over if they're going to go over at all because the signing restrictions don't hit until the next cycle(s). As such, what we've generally seen each year is most teams staying within pool limits, while a few teams go absurdly over their limit - there is no in-between.

The upcoming period's bonus pool numbers haven't been announced yet, but last year they ranged from about $2M to about $5.4M. The White Sox should be on the higher end due to previous record, so they'll likely have near $4M to spend.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>White Sox History - in Two Parts</strong></span>

If one looks at the White Sox organization's history during the current ownership's era up until around 2012, the idea of the front office even considering going over their international pool limit seems laughable. In the domestic amateur (Rule 4) draft, the team developed a pattern of spending small and going for "safe" picks while other teams blew through pool limits. In the Latin American market, the scandal around Dave Wilder in 2007 basically wiped out that pipeline for the next four to five years, so big spending was never even a consideration. It's hard to know if the strategy to go small on amateur spending came from ownership or front office management or both, but the result was the same regardless.

But what many of the team's fan base seem unaware of is just how much things have changed in the past five years or so. Looking for example at the domestic draft, since 2012 the team has shifted from minimal spending and "safe" picks, to going at least to their pool limit. Using the new rules to move money around and grab over-slot signings, the team has emphasized higher ceiling (and higher risk) players. They even went over their allotted pool in 2014, mostly to grab <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodonca01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Rodon</a> in the June draft.

On the international side, since Marco Paddy was hired in 2011 to resurrect the Latin American operations, the club has signed more than a dozen players to bonuses over $300,000 and a couple over a million (<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/micker-adolfo/">Micker Adolfo</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2015/07/chicago-white-sox-announce-july-2nd-signings/">Franklin Reyes</a>). They've used their full allotments or close to it in each of the past four cycles. And just a few weeks ago at SoxFest, when our Brian Bilek asked GM Rick Hahn about the pool limits, Hahn expressed the club is <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2016/02/interviews-from-soxfest-gm-rick-hahn-sd-nick-hostetler/">open to the idea of going over their limit</a> if the conditions line up the right way. The front office has significantly increased investment in amateur talent, and are indicating the possibility of doing even more dramatic things. This is not the same White Sox front office.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Case for 2016</span></strong>

Let's start with a quick note about 2015. Here in February, there's only about 4 months left in the current signing period. Cuban teenager Lazaro Armenteros (aka Lazarito) is getting lots of attention, and his signing would push the Sox over their limit. But given the penalty for going over, doing so and getting just one player seems like a pretty terrible approach, especially when competing with teams who already blew through them. Clubs that have gone over in the past two cycles, did so by going way over, and signing a wave of talented players at once. Otherwise, going over by 15% or more just doesn't make much sense, with it being highly unlikely any other significant talent will pop up and reach eligibility in the next four months.

That takes us to the 2016-2017 period that opens on July 2nd of this year. The reasons NOT go to over (the known costs) include:
<ul>
	<li>Financial cost - having to pay 100% overage on all signings over the limit means you are paying essentially double for the talent you are acquiring.</li>
	<li>Future talent pool cost - going two years without the ability to sign significant prospects from that pipeline is gambling a pretty big sacrifice in exchange for a one-year bolt.</li>
	<li>Signing children - let's be honest, that's what teams are doing. They are evaluating 15 and 16-year olds, and signing 16 and 17-year olds as future baseball players. The chances of any one of them becoming a valuable major leaguer, even for the highest-end prospects, are pretty low. And you are paying big money for long shots.</li>
</ul>
So what are the reasons the team SHOULD go over? Here are some:

The picture is complicated. But the question is simple - is 2016 the year the Sox should go for broke?

It sure looks like this upcoming period falls within "if they ever do it, this is the year". Having a third of MLB sidelined including most of the annually big spenders, the gates to Cuba staying cracked open, the Sox having the money and their regional operations just coming to maturity all point to this.

That simplifies the question - is it <em>ever</em> a good idea to do this? If the team's pool is $4M, but they want to go after $15M worth of talent, they end up paying $26M for it (give or take). So you are certainly over-paying on a talent value basis within that market. And you lose that chance to sign any significant prospects for two following cycles, which is a big hit.

What it comes down to is odds. As stated earlier, any of these teenagers is unlikely to provide value to a major league club - just like drafted prospects, though perhaps even more so. Which is precisely why the teams who are best at developing young, cheap talent, see no viable path other than going big - to dramatically increase the chances of getting value from it. If you're shooting in the dark, you'll hit a lot more targets if you fire a lot more shots.

Finally, in the scenario at $15M worth of talent for $26M, that extra $11M still ends up making the investment pretty cheap. That's $26M to get a massive wave of big prospect talent that can get you much more value than that among even the few who make it. And what we see in these bonuses is that three $333k prospects does not equal one $1M prospect, as the odds of future major league success are more of an exponential scale than a linear one. The latter is better, but only in so far as you going after multiple of each set. That non-linear odds curve also explains why one big year is likely higher value than three smaller years.

The light is yellow, because you can't just cruise in this market. But it's time to hit the gas if the White Sox mean business in player development. It's time for the White Sox to go for it in July. Whether Jerry and Kenny agree, and if Rick and Marco can line up the talent with high enough confidence, is something we won't know until then.

They see other teams throwing money around in the Caribbean like they've got a printing press, while the White Sox rarely seem to even be in the conversation.

Some of this is a problem of perception - the Sox have increased their spending on amateur talent both domestically and in Latin America. But it is true that there are a select few ballclubs that have decided to spend many times over as much as many of their cohorts in order to bring in waves of talented prospects. With the South Siders struggling to win at the major league level, and a farm system that has improved but hasn't been in the top half in over a decade, the natives are restless.

Does going over limits and taking on penalties to sign a big wave of teenage talent really make sense? Would the White Sox even consider it? Is now the time?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Quick Primer</strong></span>

Let's start with the structure. Players from outside the United States (and it's territories) who wish to play here are split into two categories. Those over 23 years of age and with 5+ years' professional experience are free agents and can sign with any team without restrictions from the American side. Those who don't meet that bar are subject to a set of rules around an annual signing cycle, beginning each July 2nd and running until the next June (there is a "quiet period" a few weeks before July 2nd). Players need to be at least 16 years old or turn 16 by September of the year the period begins to be eligible.

Teams are given a dollar figure that represents their "pool" for spending in this latter, generally amateur market. If a team goes over that pool by up to 5%, they pay a 100% "tax" penalty on the overage amount. If they go over by 5-10%, they get taxed and cannot sign a player for over $500,000 in the next signing period. If they go over by 10-15%, it's a $300,000 cap the next period. Finally, if they go more than 15% over, they cannot sign a player for over $300,000 the next <em>two</em> signing periods, and of course are subject to that tax. That last bracket involves a heavy price to pay.

As you can see, while the system discourages teams from going over, it also encourages teams to go way over if they're going to go over at all because the signing restrictions don't hit until the next cycle(s). As such, what we've generally seen each year is most teams staying within pool limits, while a few teams go absurdly over their limit - there is no in-between.

The upcoming period's bonus pool numbers haven't been announced yet, but last year they ranged from about $2M to about $5.4M. The White Sox should be on the higher end due to previous record, so they'll likely have near $4M to spend.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>White Sox History - in Two Parts</strong></span>

If one looks at the White Sox organization's history during the current ownership's era up until around 2012, the idea of the front office even considering going over their international pool limit seems laughable. In the domestic amateur (Rule 4) draft, the team developed a pattern of spending small and going for "safe" picks while other teams blew through pool limits. In the Latin American market, the scandal around Dave Wilder in 2007 basically wiped out that pipeline for the next four to five years, so big spending was never even a consideration. It's hard to know if the strategy to go small on amateur spending came from ownership or front office management or both, but the result was the same regardless.

But what many of the team's fan base seem unaware of is just how much things have changed in the past five years or so. Looking for example at the domestic draft, since 2012 the team has shifted from minimal spending and "safe" picks, to going at least to their pool limit. Using the new rules to move money around and grab over-slot signings, the team has emphasized higher ceiling (and higher risk) players. They even went over their allotted pool in 2014, mostly to grab <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodonca01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Rodon</a> in the June draft.

On the international side, since Marco Paddy was hired in 2011 to resurrect the Latin American operations, the club has signed more than a dozen players to bonuses over $300,000 and a couple over a million (<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/micker-adolfo/">Micker Adolfo</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2015/07/chicago-white-sox-announce-july-2nd-signings/">Franklin Reyes</a>). They've used their full allotments or close to it in each of the past four cycles. And just a few weeks ago at SoxFest, when our Brian Bilek asked GM Rick Hahn about the pool limits, Hahn expressed the club is <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2016/02/interviews-from-soxfest-gm-rick-hahn-sd-nick-hostetler/">open to the idea of going over their limit</a> if the conditions line up the right way. The front office has significantly increased investment in amateur talent, and are indicating the possibility of doing even more dramatic things. This is not the same White Sox front office.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Case for 2016</span></strong>

Let's start with a quick note about 2015. Here in February, there's only about 4 months left in the current signing period. Cuban teenager Lazaro Armenteros (aka Lazarito) is getting lots of attention, and his signing would push the Sox over their limit. But given the penalty for going over, doing so and getting just one player seems like a pretty terrible approach, especially when competing with teams who already blew through them. Clubs that have gone over in the past two cycles, did so by going way over, and signing a wave of talented players at once. Otherwise, going over by 15% or more just doesn't make much sense, with it being highly unlikely any other significant talent will pop up and reach eligibility in the next four months.

That takes us to the 2016-2017 period that opens on July 2nd of this year. The reasons NOT go to over (the known costs) include:
<ul>
	<li>Financial cost - having to pay 100% overage on all signings over the limit means you are paying essentially double for the talent you are acquiring.</li>
	<li>Future talent pool cost - going two years without the ability to sign significant prospects from that pipeline is gambling a pretty big sacrifice in exchange for a one-year bolt.</li>
	<li>Signing children - let's be honest, that's what teams are doing. They are evaluating 15 and 16-year olds, and signing 16 and 17-year olds as future baseball players. The chances of any one of them becoming a valuable major leaguer, even for the highest-end prospects, are pretty low. And you are paying big money for long shots.</li>
</ul>
So what are the reasons the team SHOULD go over? Here are some:
<ul>
	<li>In the upcoming 2016-2017 signing cycle, a whopping ten teams (CHC, LAD, SFG, KC, LAA, ARZ, TB, BOS, NYY, TOR) will be restricted to signings under $300k due to previous instances of going over the limit. So the Sox have a much smaller pool of teams to compete with, giving them a much better shot at any given prospect, especially since the teams who are out are the same ones who were throwing around the biggest money in previous years.</li>

As defections seem to be happening more and more often from the big island, there could be more Cuban talent available as the year goes on. Add this to what is perceived as a relatively strong class of talent to begin with, and it appears this should be a target-rich environment.</li>

Players signed as 16-year olds this cycle won't likely be in the majors by then, but they will be in full-season ball and represent trade value, not to mention allowing the team the flexibility to stay away from longer term free agent contracts if the next wave is coming soon.</li>

Engel had a solid slash line in his second full professional season, as he hit .251/.335/.369 in 608 plate appearances. His walk rate increased to a strong 10.2%, and his strikeout rate dropped to a less-concerning 21.7%. He also was a force on the base paths, successfully stealing 65 bases in 76 attempts. Engel was invited to play with top prospects throughout baseball (most of whom had played at higher levels than Adam) in the Arizona Fall League, where he took home MVP honors after displaying a very impressive performance including a .403 average and a 1.165 OPS. MLB Stars such as <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/arenano01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nolan Arenado</a> of the Colorado Rockies and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kris Bryant</a> of the Chicago Cubs took home the same hardware as Engel did in previous AFL seasons, so he is in some elite company.

After his performance in the AFL, Engelâs name began to be mentioned as one of the top prospects in the White Sox farm system. Though his 2015 numbers look awfully impressive, is it fair to say that <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=engel-000ada&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Engel</a> is now a legitimate prospect and quite possibly a future starting player in the White Sox outfield?

Engel, a product of the University of Louisville, was selected by the White Sox in the 19<sup>th</sup> round of the 2013 MLB First Year Player Draft. But he signed for $100k, which is similar to what draftees get paid who were taken around the 10th round. With the White Sox paying him that kind of moneyÂ as a middle round pick, they must have seen some tools on Engel that they really liked.

I was fortunate enough to see Engel play on a few occasions while he was at the University of Louisville. He hit leadoff and played centerfield for the Cardinals, and there were many tangibles that were quite noticeable. The first thing I noticed was that Engel really stood out from a physical standpoint, as he looked like a middle linebacker and not a baseball player (Not a surprise, he was a star high school football player in Ohio). I also got to see how athletic he was right away, as his defense in centerfield was quite impressive. He got really good reads on balls and was able to track them down with ease. At the first game I saw him live, he brought back what most thought was a sure home run and made it look easy. I was able to find some footage on it as well, which you can see here (from Cardinals Baseball):

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7HSR4rOLaE" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Engel also displayed tremendous speed both in the outfield and on the base paths. Engel was no question a plus runner and a plus defender like many scouts said, but the one big question mark was whether he could improve at the plate, a concern I agreed with.

I was not impressed with his hitting abilities while at Louisville, as he really had a hard time with off-speed and did not have the greatest plate discipline in my opinion. In particular, Engel could not lay off low and away off-speed, as he would have been lucky to hit these pitches with a boat paddle.Â  Engel was able to get a fair amount of infield hits because of his speed, but most like myself assumed he would have a harder time beating out balls in pro-ball, as defenses are much improved. I did think there was some missing potential with the bat with Engel, but after a disappointing junior campaign at Louisville where he only hit .236 with one home run, I felt that he wouldnât amount to much at the professional level and that his defense and athleticism would only take him so far.

Though I have not seen Engel live as a professional, it is evident that his hitting ability has drastically improved. After solid 2014 and 2015 campaigns and an awfully impressive AFL showing, most would assume Engel is the real deal. White Sox scouting director Nick Hostetler has raved about Engelâs work ethic and ability to improve at the plate, and noted that he has made significant changes in his swing since becoming a professional. He also detailed to us back in May what he's done in <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2015/07/interviews-with-winston-salems-trey-michalczewski-andre-wheeler-charles-poe-jake-peter-and-adam-engel/">changing his pitch recognition and hitting approach</a>, and you can see statistically that he improved as the year went on. This past weekend at SoxFest, Hostetler said that Engel came into the White Sox organization as a very stiff hitter, and that they have really worked on him staying loose and more fluid with his swing, especially with his upper half. You can see in the video here from White Sox Hitting Mini-Camp in Glendale last month that Engel looks much more fluid and athletic with his swing (credit White Sox via South Side Sox):

And compare that to what we saw during the 2015 season, in May, prior to his late-season re-tooling (our own video):

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiclK6NjZ94" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe>

I personally think there is still a bit more room for improvement, as I donât like the little hitch he has in his backload even now, but his swing has much improved since his days at Louisville and even just during this past season.

Our recent Top 30 White Sox Prospects list shows Adam Engel as the 8th best prospect in the system, jumping from 22nd back in July. Fangraphs has him at 4th in their recent list (up from 21st a year ago), Baseball America has him at 7th and Baseball Prospectus has him 9th, so clearly many analysts are seeing things they like in his development.

Though Engel has been a solid professional as of late, I do think that the 2016 campaign will be a major test for him and will help us see whether he truly is a potential starting outfielder in the future for the White Sox. His AFL stint was impressive, but pitchers generally are coming off full professional seasons, which mean their arms could be tired and they could lack their best stuff. In addition, hitting in Arizona with the dry heat probably boosts offensive statistics a bit. And then of course there is the issue of sample size - 86 plate appearances shouldn't be weighted too heavily. ItÂ would be crazy to assume he would put up similar numbers in a full season.

I am hopeful that he can build on this and continue to improve with the bat this season. I would like to see him continue to cut down on his strikeouts.Â Cutting down on the kâs will mean getting on base at a better clip given his speed, and he only becomes more dangerous as he is obviously a very strong threat on the base paths.

I am increasingly confident that the White Sox have found a late round gem in Adam Engel. Already a plus runner with a great glove and a good arm, it is normal for White Sox die-hards to be excited about him. With a tremendous work ethic and incredible athleticism, the sky is the limit for Engel. Future Soxâs own Will Siskel was able to <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2015/05/game-story-winston-salem-dash-5272015-with-video-and-scouting-notes/">see Engel live in May</a> and noted that he will go as far as his hit tool can develop, which I couldnât agree more with. Realistically, even if he could possess an average bat at the big league level, the White Sox would have a very nice player on their hands. In all likelihood, Engel will start 2016 with the Birmingham Barons in AA. If he can build off his 2015 season and put together another solid campaign, I then think Engel would be a legitimate potential starter prospect and one who we would see on the South Side in the near future.

Engel had a solid slash line in his second full professional season, as he hit .251/.335/.369 in 608 plate appearances. His walk rate increased to a strong 10.2%, and his strikeout rate dropped to a less-concerning 21.7%. He also was a force on the base paths, successfully stealing 65 bases in 76 attempts. Engel was invited to play with top prospects throughout baseball (most of whom had played at higher levels than Adam) in the Arizona Fall League, where he took home MVP honors after displaying a very impressive performance including a .403 average and a 1.165 OPS. MLB Stars such as <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/arenano01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nolan Arenado</a> of the Colorado Rockies and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kris Bryant</a> of the Chicago Cubs took home the same hardware as Engel did in previous AFL seasons, so he is in some elite company.

After his performance in the AFL, Engelâs name began to be mentioned as one of the top prospects in the White Sox farm system. Though his 2015 numbers look awfully impressive, is it fair to say that <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=engel-000ada&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Engel</a> is now a legitimate prospect and quite possibly a future starting player in the White Sox outfield?

Engel, a product of the University of Louisville, was selected by the White Sox in the 19<sup>th</sup> round of the 2013 MLB First Year Player Draft. But he signed for $100k, which is similar to what draftees get paid who were taken around the 10th round. With the White Sox paying him that kind of moneyÂ as a middle round pick, they must have seen some tools on Engel that they really liked.

I was fortunate enough to see Engel play on a few occasions while he was at the University of Louisville. He hit leadoff and played centerfield for the Cardinals, and there were many tangibles that were quite noticeable. The first thing I noticed was that Engel really stood out from a physical standpoint, as he looked like a middle linebacker and not a baseball player (Not a surprise, he was a star high school football player in Ohio). I also got to see how athletic he was right away, as his defense in centerfield was quite impressive. He got really good reads on balls and was able to track them down with ease. At the first game I saw him live, he brought back what most thought was a sure home run and made it look easy. I was able to find some footage on it as well, which you can see here (from Cardinals Baseball):

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7HSR4rOLaE" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Engel also displayed tremendous speed both in the outfield and on the base paths. Engel was no question a plus runner and a plus defender like many scouts said, but the one big question mark was whether he could improve at the plate, a concern I agreed with.

I was not impressed with his hitting abilities while at Louisville, as he really had a hard time with off-speed and did not have the greatest plate discipline in my opinion. In particular, Engel could not lay off low and away off-speed, as he would have been lucky to hit these pitches with a boat paddle.Â  Engel was able to get a fair amount of infield hits because of his speed, but most like myself assumed he would have a harder time beating out balls in pro-ball, as defenses are much improved. I did think there was some missing potential with the bat with Engel, but after a disappointing junior campaign at Louisville where he only hit .236 with one home run, I felt that he wouldnât amount to much at the professional level and that his defense and athleticism would only take him so far.

Though I have not seen Engel live as a professional, it is evident that his hitting ability has drastically improved. After solid 2014 and 2015 campaigns and an awfully impressive AFL showing, most would assume Engel is the real deal. White Sox scouting director Nick Hostetler has raved about Engelâs work ethic and ability to improve at the plate, and noted that he has made significant changes in his swing since becoming a professional. He also detailed to us back in May what he's done in <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2015/07/interviews-with-winston-salems-trey-michalczewski-andre-wheeler-charles-poe-jake-peter-and-adam-engel/">changing his pitch recognition and hitting approach</a>, and you can see statistically that he improved as the year went on.

When I spoke with Chicagoâs new Scouting Director Nick Hostetler on Friday he admitted that the White Soxâ pursuit of compensation-attached free agents was definitely something to watch for the first year scouting director:
<blockquote>âIt helps a little bit talking with Rick and Jeremy (Haber) and Kenny on a daily basis and knowing whatâs going on so youâre not caught off guard if something should happen or thereâs rumors of what is the truth and what is not the truth. Itâs been a little bit more on Twitter, a little bit more on the blogs reading stuff to see if something popped that I didnât know about and call them and say, âHey, is this true?â</blockquote>
General Manager Rick Hahn faced plenty of questions on the qualifying offer pick throughout the weekend. When I was speaking with Hahn on Friday, he stressed the value it could bring to the draft process, saying the pick, âallows us to either move money up or move money back. If we want to try to get different types of talent later or earlier in the draft, it provides us a great deal of flexibility.â Even so, the fourth-year General Manager felt the need to elaborate towards the possibility of losing the pick, âI will say that, if for whatever reason we wind up without that sandwich pick, weâll still have two in the top fifty and have ourselves a standard draft so to speak.â

When speaking with the fans at his two seminars with Robin Ventura, Hahn referred to the pick as a âreal consideration.â At the same time, Hahn stressed the importance of making good on the team they have right now and the season they have ahead:
<blockquote>"At the end of the day, our focus right now is putting ourselves in the best position to win in 2016. The 27<sup>th</sup>/28<sup>th</sup> pick in the draft, is important but itâs a longer-term consideration. At the end, it depends on balancing those things out and prioritizing what we feel is important right now. If we do, for whatever reason, wind up losing that pick at least weâll still have a full complement in the draft."</blockquote>
With the offseason winding down, there are only <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/11/twenty-free-agents-receive-qualifying-offers.html">three players remaining who have received qualifying offers on the market.</a> Outfielder Dexter Fowler and shortstop Ian Desmond are the two players that have been tied to the White Sox but the White Sox do hold plenty other options. Hahn had opened the SoxFest festivities by assuring the media that the team is still active: âWe are still going to work with what seems to be a rather fluid market for players right up until Opening Day.â It remains to be seen whether the White Sox will own the compensation pick come June, but you can at least be sure that Hostetler will be watching, and Hahn will be involved.

After going through it last year, Iâll say the media portion of SoxFest goes by incredibly quick. The White Sox media relations team is clear that SoxFest is an event reserved for fan experience so all formal interviews must be done by 3:45 on Friday afternoon â before SoxFest actually even starts. General Manager Rick Hahn kicks off the ceremony when he takes the stage at 2:30. Another fifteen-minute presser follows Hahn as Manager Robin Ventura takes questions from the Chicago media. The remaining hour is reserved for the media, and myself apparently, to speak with the executives, players and prospects of the Chicago White Sox.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Rick Hahn Press Conference</b></span>

Hahn took the stage and informed the media that he would start with an opening preamble and then let the media answer any questions they may have. Below are some of the more distinguished quotes from the White Sox General Manger.

<b>Opening Statement: â</b>It (SoxFest) is a bit of an artificial deadline. Last year we clearly had a lot of the heavy lifting done. We are still going to work with what seems to be a rather fluid market for players right up until Opening Day.â

<b>On Fulmer</b>: âThe funny thing is if Carson contributed to us in 2017, the year after this one, that would be an extremely quick developmental periodâ¦ Given how quickly Chris Sale came along, how quickly Carlos Rodon came along, thereâs an idea in the back of some peopleâs head that perhaps Carson will be on that same path given his talent, given his makeupâ¦Certainly weâre not ruling anything out. The good ones have a way of forcing that time frame and letting you know when theyâre ready and once they do weâll create that opportunity for them.â

<b>On Anderson breaking Spring Training with the club: </b>âHeâs had a pretty clear development path. If we stuck with that plan the next stop would be Charlotte.â

<b>On Saladino replacing Alexei Ramirez as the shortstop: â</b>Thatâs a very strong possibility. Heâll come into camp along with Carlos Sanchez right now and compete for that job. We have a lot of confidence in Tyler especially from a defensive standpoint and if he were to join the club as the everyday shortstop hitting out of the nine hole we know heâs going to be able to do certain things we look for from that spot.â

<b>On the idea of rebuilding, </b>âThe notion that, âcould we change directions, could we go, say, to a total rebuild situation,â everything is always on the table when you donât achieve your goals. At this point we decided it was important to take advantage of the talent we had on this roster.Â  With Chris Sale, Jose Abreu, Rodon, Eaton and Quintana entering arguably the primes of their career. At this time we didnât feel like it was the right move to make. We felt it was the time to augment this roster and not subtract from it.â

<b>On potentially adding a bat, â</b>The more options we have the easier it is for Robin to go with the best lineup. If there is, whether itâs the group we have today or if there is another addition, it will create a situation where the best guys are going to play. We certainly would love to put Robin in the spot where he has more quality choices to make and heâs able to use the lineup card as a meritocracy and the best guys play.â

<b>On rumored 3 year stance on free agent outfielders, </b>âLet me make something really clear: There is absolutely no hardline, dogma, limit on contract terms with free agents. The reason we didnât sign any of the hitters that thus far have signed elsewhere at the end of the day is not about contract term limitations. We had numerous conversations, with various parameters, various structures, right up until the day or the day before these players wound up choosing their ultimate destinations.â

After Hahn left the stage, Ventura spoke quickly and the media session took place. I was able to get some short interviews with Adam Engel, Eddy Alvarez, Jacob May, Carson Fulmer, Scouting Director Nick Hostetler and General Manager Rick Hahn. We will post these interviews throughout the week. For more coverage from SoxFest, Â you can follow us on twitter @FutureSox and subscribe to our articles below.

Who will jump out from under the radar this time? Here are eleven possibilities on the pitching side, which fall into three categories (but not in any specific order in each section)...

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015 Draftees</span>

Chicago native and Simeon graduate <strong><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/2015/09/qa-with-blake-hickman/">Blake Hickman</a></strong> was drafted in the 7th round, and despite some thinking he'd be a tough sign he ended up taking a slightly under-slot bonus. Then it was revealed he needed Tommy John surgery, which he is now recovering from. Hickman is a converted catcher who throws a mid-90's fastball and a sharp slider, and put up very good numbers for Iowa in 2015 despite being fairly new to pitching. There's a lot of raw talent here and in some ways he is similar to 2012 draftee <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=brenna001bra&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brandon Brennan</a>Â (age when drafted, mid-T10 round, relative lack of experience in college, pitching stuff, even height and weight). Blake reports the plan is to be ready for game action by summer, and he's stated he'll be in Arizona (AZL) for 2016 as a 22-year old.

Prep hurler <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=comito000chr&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Christopher Comito</a> </strong>was taken in the 15th round, but signed for a $170,000 bonus more in line with an 8th round pick (he was seen as a tough sign with an Iowa commit). The 6'5" righty debuted in the AZL and showed good control (2.5 BB/9), and didn't miss a ton of bats (5.2 K/9), but he was in limited action and going to pro ball after a high school season. In-person looks in Arizona from Kim Contreras and a second prospect writer talked about a low 90's fastball that he commanded very well for his age, a breaking ball with encouraging movement and a change-up. Going into the 2016 season as a 19-year old, likely he is with one of the rookie league affiliates again in the rotation. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o5adgkbzDw">video of him</a> from Fall Instructs pitching to a rehabbing Yasiel Puig.

Unlike the two pitchers above, 11th-rounder <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=dopico000dan&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Danny Dopico</a></strong> is a pure reliever. In his professional debut as a 21-year old with Great Falls, he posted some very nice peripherals (7.5 H/9, 3.6 BB/9, 14.4 K/9) across 35 innings. Chris Kusiolek got a good look at him in Fall Instructs and reports he's got a mid-90's fastball (touched 96) with late action, and a nice mid-80's slider that he showed good feel for, along with an under-construction splitter. Dopico looks like he's probably Kannapolis' closer in 2016.

A 6'9", 280 pound righty who was a big time prospect in high school, <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=cherry000tay&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylore Cherry</a></strong> is a project. He pitched briefly in 2013, then 42.2 innings for North Carolina in 2014, but didn't enter a game there in 2015. The Sox took a flyer on him in the 32nd round, and the numbers showed promise in his debut: 25.1 IP, 11 H (!!!), 1 ER, 12 BB, 29 K. As you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y41F5aGQeE">this video</a>, his delivery is quite stiff and short, and frankly he's just not in good baseball shape. Based on a report from college, when he's on he's got a fastball in the low 90's (touches 95) with serious sink and arm-side run, but he was very inconsistent. He should be in full season ball at some point in 2016, and we'll have a better idea of how things translate.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experienced Starters</span>

<strong>Brandon Brennan</strong> has been just outside our Top 30 lists for much of his time in the system since being drafted in 2012. He's got a low-to-mid-90's sinker and a slider that has at times flashed plus characteristics. What has prevented him from climbing further up the ladder is a lack of consistent innings, due to a combination of rawness at draft time (college draftee, but with just 1 year of play), and time lost to injuries (<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy John</a> and recovery in 2013-2014, neck injury in 2015). Now entering his age 24/25 season and 5th year as a pro, he's pitched just 55 games in the minors. When he's healthy and has his stuff, he profiles as a potentially effective major league reliever, though he's been used as a starter so far and likely stays that way for now. Brennan probably opens 2016 in the Birmingham rotation, where he'll be challenged and get stretched out again.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=dykstr001jam&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">James Dykstra</a></strong> broke out in 2014 with a strong season across both levels of A-ball, relying on strong command and heavy stuff that led to a ridiculously low walk rate (0.9 BB/9) and high ground ball rate (2.36 GO/AO). Adding to a heavy 2-seam fastball and a decent curve, Dykstra had added an improved change-up (that now looks above average) to the mix. In 2015 he repeated A+ which was a mild surprise, and then moved to a relief role. It's hard to say where he ends up long-term, but a 1-2 punch of that 2-seamer and his change-up with a curve thrown in occasionally could profile well in the bullpen. Dykstra should be in AA Birmingham in 2016 as a 25-year old.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experienced Relievers</span>

Lefty <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=wheele001and&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andre Wheeler</a></strong> converted from outfielder during college and came into the system raw, but broke out in 2014 with a solid campaign in Kannapolis as part of a tandem with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=guerre005jor,guerre004jor&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jordan Guerrero</a> (2.85 ERA, 2.9 BB/9, 10.2 K/9). In 2015 he primarily worked in relief, which is his likely home going forward, and did well but not as well as 2014. Wheeler has a low 90's fastball that touches mid-90's, a slider that shows solidly plus when he's on, and is very tough on LHB which indicates a potential LOOGY future. Wheeler will be 24 this season, probably in Birmingham's bullpen, and could move up quickly in an area of organizational weakness (lefty specialist relievers).

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=leyer-000rob&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Robin Leyer</a></strong> is a reliever, though he did the prototypical White Sox reliever development path of getting in a year as a starter along the way. The results in 2015 were decent across A+ and AA (8.9 H/9, 3.2 BB/9, 6.9 K/9) mostly in starts. Simply put, he's got a very nice mid-90's fastball with some good movement, but the rest of his repertoire is lacking anything noteworthy or even reliable. He's a gamble, you believe in the fastball and hope he develops one decent offspeed pitch to make him a potential MLB reliever. He'll be 23 for this upcoming season and in either AA or AAA, so there's time for him to work on a playable second pitch.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=ynoa--001mic&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Michael Ynoa</a></strong> was a truly elite prospect at one time, but injuries and surgery meant he had only pitched in 40 games in his first 4 years after signing. The White Sox got him in the Samardzija trade as an add-on piece, and he posted pretty good numbers at Winston-Salem in 2015 (8.8 H/9, 3.8 BB/9, 9.5 K/9) in 38 innings. He missed time to injury, though this time minor, so health is an ongoing concern. But the possibility of him staying healthy, and flashing the electric fastball and plus hammer curve once again gleams in the distance to provide some hope. Ynoa likely is in AA at 24 for 2016, and he's the kind of talent you keep giving a shot.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=goldbe000bra&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brad Goldberg</a></strong> grabbed attention putting up very solid numbers in his draft year (2013) across Rookie, A and A+ (35 IP, 17 H, 6 ER, 9 BB, 49 K), attacking the zone with a mid-90's fastball. In 2014 he was put in the Winston-Salem rotation and struggled in the role, eventually moving back to the pen. This past spring though, he showed up having lost a lot of weight, and during the season we got reports of his fastball suddenly bumping 99. His numbers were good to go with it, though he was 25 in Advanced A-ball. Don't let the age throw you off here though, as anyone who can throw that hard for strikes consistently bears monitoring. He's also very sharp and showed a lot of focus in making the adjustments he has thus far.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=marin-001ter&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terance Marin</a></strong> has had quite a ride the past few years, which you can read about in <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/terance-marin/">his prospect profile</a>. In 2015, he opened his first season in AAA by rattling off over 30 straight innings of scoreless baseball as a starter. He ended up bouncing back and forth between the rotation and the pen there, with mixed results. Today's Marin has a tailing fastball that runs low 90's but has touched 95, and a very nice cutter along with some middling offspeed stuff that he commands well. Marin's stuff doesn't have the flash of his flowing mane, but when he's on he looks like a major league middle reliever. The White Sox bullpen race for 2016 is crowded, but they will inevitably need relief help during the season and Marin figures to be on the short list.

Prep hurler <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=comito000chr&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Christopher Comito</a> </strong>was taken in the 15th round, but signed for a $170,000 bonus more in line with an 8th round pick (he was seen as a tough sign with an Iowa commit). The 6'5" righty debuted in the AZL and showed good control (2.5 BB/9), and didn't miss a ton of bats (5.2 K/9), but he was in limited action and going to pro ball after a high school season. In-person looks in Arizona from Kim Contreras and a second prospect writer talked about a low 90's fastball that he commanded very well for his age, a breaking ball with encouraging movement and a change-up. Going into the 2016 season as a 19-year old, likely he is with one of the rookie league affiliates again in the rotation. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o5adgkbzDw">video of him</a> from Fall Instructs pitching to a rehabbing Yasiel Puig.

Unlike the two pitchers above, 11th-rounder <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=dopico000dan&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Danny Dopico</a></strong> is a pure reliever. In his professional debut as a 21-year old with Great Falls, he posted some very nice peripherals (7.5 H/9, 3.6 BB/9, 14.4 K/9) across 35 innings. Chris Kusiolek got a good look at him in Fall Instructs and reports he's got a mid-90's fastball (touched 96) with late action, and a nice mid-80's slider that he showed good feel for, along with an under-construction splitter. Dopico looks like he's probably Kannapolis' closer in 2016.

A 6'9", 280 pound righty who was a big time prospect in high school, <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=cherry000tay&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taylore Cherry</a></strong> is a project. He pitched briefly in 2013, then 42.2 innings for North Carolina in 2014, but didn't enter a game there in 2015. The Sox took a flyer on him in the 32nd round, and the numbers showed promise in his debut: 25.1 IP, 11 H (!!!), 1 ER, 12 BB, 29 K. As you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y41F5aGQeE">this video</a>, his delivery is quite stiff and short, and frankly he's just not in good baseball shape. Based on a report from college, when he's on he's got a fastball in the low 90's (touches 95) with serious sink and arm-side run, but he was very inconsistent. He should be in full season ball at some point in 2016, and we'll have a better idea of how things translate.

<strong>Brandon Brennan</strong> has been just outside our Top 30 lists for much of his time in the system since being drafted in 2012. He's got a low-to-mid-90's sinker and a slider that has at times flashed plus characteristics. What has prevented him from climbing further up the ladder is a lack of consistent innings, due to a combination of rawness at draft time (college draftee, but with just 1 year of play), and time lost to injuries (<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tommy John</a> and recovery in 2013-2014, neck injury in 2015). Now entering his age 24/25 season and 5th year as a pro, he's pitched just 55 games in the minors. When he's healthy and has his stuff, he profiles as a potentially effective major league reliever, though he's been used as a starter so far and likely stays that way for now. Brennan probably opens 2016 in the Birmingham rotation, where he'll be challenged and get stretched out again.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=dykstr001jam&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">James Dykstra</a></strong> broke out in 2014 with a strong season across both levels of A-ball, relying on strong command and heavy stuff that led to a ridiculously low walk rate (0.9 BB/9) and high ground ball rate (2.36 GO/AO). Adding to a heavy 2-seam fastball and a decent curve, Dykstra had added an improved change-up (that now looks above average) to the mix. In 2015 he repeated A+ which was a mild surprise, and then moved to a relief role. It's hard to say where he ends up long-term, but a 1-2 punch of that 2-seamer and his change-up with a curve thrown in occasionally could profile well in the bullpen. Dykstra should be in AA Birmingham in 2016 as a 25-year old.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experienced Relievers</span>

Lefty <strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=wheele001and&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andre Wheeler</a></strong> converted from outfielder during college and came into the system raw, but broke out in 2014 with a solid campaign in Kannapolis as part of a tandem with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=guerre005jor,guerre004jor&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jordan Guerrero</a> (2.85 ERA, 2.9 BB/9, 10.2 K/9). In 2015 he primarily worked in relief, which is his likely home going forward, and did well but not as well as 2014. Wheeler has a low 90's fastball that touches mid-90's, a slider that shows solidly plus when he's on, and is very tough on LHB which indicates a potential LOOGY future. Wheeler will be 24 this season, probably in Birmingham's bullpen, and could move up quickly in an area of organizational weakness (lefty specialist relievers).

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=leyer-000rob&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Robin Leyer</a></strong> is a reliever, though he did the prototypical White Sox reliever development path of getting in a year as a starter along the way. The results in 2015 were decent across A+ and AA (8.9 H/9, 3.2 BB/9, 6.9 K/9) mostly in starts. Simply put, he's got a very nice mid-90's fastball with some good movement, but the rest of his repertoire is lacking anything noteworthy or even reliable. He's a gamble, you believe in the fastball and hope he develops one decent offspeed pitch to make him a potential MLB reliever. He'll be 23 for this upcoming season and in either AA or AAA, so there's time for him to work on a playable second pitch.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=ynoa--001mic&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Michael Ynoa</a></strong> was a truly elite prospect at one time, but injuries and surgery meant he had only pitched in 40 games in his first 4 years after signing. The White Sox got him in the Samardzija trade as an add-on piece, and he posted pretty good numbers at Winston-Salem in 2015 (8.8 H/9, 3.8 BB/9, 9.5 K/9) in 38 innings. He missed time to injury, though this time minor, so health is an ongoing concern. But the possibility of him staying healthy, and flashing the electric fastball and plus hammer curve once again gleams in the distance to provide some hope. Ynoa likely is in AA at 24 for 2016, and he's the kind of talent you keep giving a shot.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=goldbe000bra&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brad Goldberg</a></strong> grabbed attention putting up very solid numbers in his draft year (2013) across Rookie, A and A+ (35 IP, 17 H, 6 ER, 9 BB, 49 K), attacking the zone with a mid-90's fastball. In 2014 he was put in the Winston-Salem rotation and struggled in the role, eventually moving back to the pen. This past spring though, he showed up having lost a lot of weight, and during the season we got reports of his fastball suddenly bumping 99. His numbers were good to go with it, though he was 25 in Advanced A-ball. Don't let the age throw you off here though, as anyone who can throw that hard for strikes consistently bears monitoring. He's also very sharp and showed a lot of focus in making the adjustments he has thus far.

<strong><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=marin-001ter&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-www.chicagonow.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terance Marin</a></strong> has had quite a ride the past few years, which you can read about in <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/future-sox/terance-marin/">his prospect profile</a>. In 2015, he opened his first season in AAA by rattling off over 30 straight innings of scoreless baseball as a starter. He ended up bouncing back and forth between the rotation and the pen there, with mixed results. Today's Marin has a tailing fastball that runs low 90's but has touched 95, and a very nice cutter along with some middling offspeed stuff that he commands well. Marin's stuff doesn't have the flash of his flowing mane, but when he's on he looks like a major league middle reliever. The White Sox bullpen race for 2016 is crowded, but they will inevitably need relief help during the season and Marin figures to be on the short list.
