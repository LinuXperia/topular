They are who they are, true champions, because of what they have on the inside…intrinsic pieces that help to exemplify a certain greatness. An inner excellence that defies any reason…something that pushes the true champion toward possibilities many would see as…simply…impossible. Kayla Montgomery is certainly one of those stories. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Please…if you do anything today…do THIS…take the time to watch Kayla’s story. You will not be disappointed as it may very well inspire YOU to be something more. AND be forewarned…have Kleenex handy. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"> </span></span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">And to that point above, two articles written by Tom Fordyce (Chief Sports Writer for the BBC), </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/athletics/29510575"><i><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Drug cheats in sport could benefit 'for decades', scientists find</span></i></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> and </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/athletics/29515182"><i><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Justin Gatlin: Why US sprinter's success is bad for athletics</span></i></a><span style="font-size: medium;"> do lean heavily toward the idea of a lifetime ban for athletes using illegal PEDs…certainly an absolute. In both pieces, Fordyce discuss the recent discovery that benefits from illegal PED use appear to last for many years beyond cessation of use…</span><i><span style="font-size: medium;">“decades”</span></i><span style="font-size: medium;"> even.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Studies on female mice (mammals with musculature aspects similar to humans) indicate benefits far beyond current and possible future bans for said use. In Fordyce’s BBC piece, </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/athletics/29510575"><i><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Drug cheats in sport could benefit 'for decades', scientists find</span></i></a><span style="font-size: medium;">, it states that </span><i><span style="font-size: medium;">“research by University of Oslo scientists has established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken.”</span></i>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Professor of Physiology at Oslo, Kristian Gundersen, said <i>“it is likely that effects could be lifelong or at least lasting decades in humans.”</i></span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition, Gundersen indicated that he would be surprised <i>“if there were any major differences between humans and mice in this context. </i></span>

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"The fundamental biology of muscle growth is similar in humans and in mice, and in principle any drug that builds muscle mass could trigger this mechanism. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was excited by the clarity of the findings. It's very rare, at least in my experience, that the data are so clear cut; there is usually some disturbing factor. But in this case it was extremely clear. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you exercise, or take anabolic steroids, you get more nuclei and you get bigger muscles. If you take away the steroids, you lose the muscle mass, but the nuclei remain inside the muscle fibres.</span></i>

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"They are like temporarily closed factories, ready to start producing protein again when you start exercising again."</span></i></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium;">These are powerful statements made by Professor Gundersen…points given much weight based on the science behind them. The kind of significance and clarity that lends credence to the very title of this piece…<i>Lifetime Ban for PED Use in Sports Looking Like Only Option</i></span><span style="font-size: medium;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">If using illegal PEDs gives athletes a “lifetime” advantage…well…then I am not sure there is any other alternative than a lifetime ban from sports for those who choose to use. It might be the <i>only</i></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> level of consequence that actually fits the crime.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">I am sure WADA will weigh in on this at some point, however, expect them to only move forward with increase of suspension (as they have recently moved from a two to four year ban) when more substantial and unequivocal evidence is available. The kind of confirmation that indicates a cause and effect relationship between the use of PEDs and lifetime advantages…even with cessation. </span>

<b><span style="font-size: medium;"> UPDATE</span></b>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Travis Tygart, United States Anti-Doping Agency's chief executive, stated his feeling that violators of the USADA drug policy, like Justin Gatlin (has served two bans for PED use) should be given another chance. In a BBC piece today,  </span><i><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/the-athletes-sports-experience-making-a-difference/wp-admin/Justin%20Gatlin%20deserves%20chance%20after%20drug%20bans%20-%20Usada's%20Travis%20Tygart"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Justin Gatlin deserves chance after drug bans...,</span></a></i><span style="font-size: medium;">Tygart said:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"If somebody commits a violation, serves a ban and comes back to the sport, part of the rule is this idea of redemption..."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium;">And with regard to the recent Oslo research he stated:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"There is some recent science on the effect of steroids on mice, but there is no proof yet it translates to humans"...</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">"We've looked at it and you have to be cautious about changing the goalposts in the middle of the game based on a few sound-bites in the press from one paper on mice.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not fair. What's fair, and what athletes and the public rely on, is a set of rules that are enforced evenly."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium;">I really, really like the way Mr. Tygart thinks. He is the <em>RIGHT</em> man for the job as he does seem to incorporate a global thought process in his dealings with the PED issue facing our current sports culture.</span>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Kirk Mango";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7635:"<span style="font-size: medium;">In general…I am not one who supports absolutes.

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was excited by the clarity of the findings. It's very rare, at least in my experience, that the data are so clear cut; there is usually some disturbing factor. But in this case it was extremely clear. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you exercise, or take anabolic steroids, you get more nuclei and you get bigger muscles. If you take away the steroids, you lose the muscle mass, but the nuclei remain inside the muscle fibres.</span></i>

<i><span style="font-size: medium;">"They are like temporarily closed factories, ready to start producing protein again when you start exercising again."</span></i></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium;">These are powerful statements made by Professor Gundersen…points given much weight based on the science behind them. The kind of significance and clarity that lends credence to the very title of this piece…<i>Lifetime Ban for PED Use in Sports Looking Like Only Option</i></span><span style="font-size: medium;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">If using illegal PEDs gives athletes a “lifetime” advantage…well…then I am not sure there is any other alternative than a lifetime ban from sports for those who choose to use. It might be the <i>only</i></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> level of consequence that actually fits the crime.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">I am sure WADA will weigh in on this at some point, however, expect them to only move forward with increase of suspension (as they have recently moved from a two to four year ban) when more substantial and unequivocal evidence is available. The kind of confirmation that indicates a cause and effect relationship between the use of PEDs and lifetime advantages…even with cessation. </span>

<b><span style="font-size: medium;"> UPDATE</span></b>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Travis Tygart, United States Anti-Doping Agency's chief executive, stated his feeling that violators of the USADA drug policy, like Justin Gatlin (has served two bans for PED use) should be given another chance. In a BBC piece today,  </span><i><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/the-athletes-sports-experience-making-a-difference/wp-admin/Justin%20Gatlin%20deserves%20chance%20after%20drug%20bans%20-%20Usada's%20Travis%20Tygart"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-size: medium;">Justin Gatlin deserves chance after drug bans...,</span></a></i><span style="font-size: medium;">Tygart said:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"If somebody commits a violation, serves a ban and comes back to the sport, part of the rule is this idea of redemption..."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium;">And with regard to the recent Oslo research he stated:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: medium;">"There is some recent science on the effect of steroids on mice, but there is no proof yet it translates to humans"...</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">"We've looked at it and you have to be cautious about changing the goalposts in the middle of the game based on a few sound-bites in the press from one paper on mice.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not fair. What's fair, and what athletes and the public rely on, is a set of rules that are enforced evenly."</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium;">I really, really like the way Mr. Tygart thinks. He is the <em>RIGHT</em> man for the job as he does seem to incorporate a global thought process in his dealings with the PED issue facing our current sports culture.</span>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

It is likely safe to assume that most would focus their thoughts on PED’s (performance enhancing drugs).</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, a winning at all costs attitude can take many forms…one of which was recently highlighted by Steve Delsohn in an <i>Outside the Lines</i> ESPN video piece <em><span style="color: #000000;">UNC Academic Scandal: Whistleblower, Former Athlete Speak Out</span></em></span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">In it, Mary Willingham (former Learning Specialist for UNC-Chapel Hill) and former UNC football player Deunta Williams reveal a different kind of “winning at all costs” attitude. One that puts the future of college athletes <i>at risk</i>, where learning and <i>real</i> academic success was relegated to the bottom of the list, and where the practice of <i>fake</i> classes (“paper classes”) becomes commonplace…and is encouraged.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Ms. Willingham starts out the interview with a startling statement…putting everything into context…that student reading levels of some UNC athletes, individuals certified by compliance to compete and who supposedly meet academic standards, were at a second- or third-grade level. Something she explains would be considered illiterate for an adult.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Here…take a look:</span>

<i><a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=10671809"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">UNC Academic Scandal: Whistleblower, Former Athlete Speak Out</span></a></i>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Bringing this all into ultra-focus is Mary’s statement toward the end of the video:</span>

<i><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">“I think that to keep winning and to keep these athletes eligible we had to do something and so we cheated.”</span></i>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Hey…here’s a novel idea. How about building remedial programs that MUST be taken, ones that will build student reading skills…student learning, instead of <i>taking the easy way out</i> by encouraging these paper classes? How about NOT accepting anything below minimum standards and offering ways…options…so student athletes CAN work their way back in…if they are willing to put forth the efforts. You know…you get what you earn…NOT we’ll make it easy for you if you can help us win.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">I know from personal experience that what Mary Willingham describes is not specific to just UNC…but goes on at, likely, many other universities…and in many other forms. In fact, I know of athletes being pressured to “help” other athletes (who are less than capable and not necessarily willing to put forth the effort) in order to make sure they stay eligible…so they can “win” games.</span>

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000000;">However, a winning at all costs attitude can take many forms…one of which was recently highlighted by Steve Delsohn in an <i>Outside the Lines</i> ESPN video piece <em><span style="color: #000000;">UNC Academic Scandal: Whistleblower, Former Athlete Speak Out</span></em></span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">In it, Mary Willingham (former Learning Specialist for UNC-Chapel Hill) and former UNC football player Deunta Williams reveal a different kind of “winning at all costs” attitude. One that puts the future of college athletes <i>at risk</i>, where learning and <i>real</i> academic success was relegated to the bottom of the list, and where the practice of <i>fake</i> classes (“paper classes”) becomes commonplace…and is encouraged.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Ms. Willingham starts out the interview with a startling statement…putting everything into context…that student reading levels of some UNC athletes, individuals certified by compliance to compete and who supposedly meet academic standards, were at a second- or third-grade level. Something she explains would be considered illiterate for an adult.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Here…take a look:</span>

<i><a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=10671809"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">UNC Academic Scandal: Whistleblower, Former Athlete Speak Out</span></a></i>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Bringing this all into ultra-focus is Mary’s statement toward the end of the video:</span>

<i><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">“I think that to keep winning and to keep these athletes eligible we had to do something and so we cheated.”</span></i>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Hey…here’s a novel idea. How about building remedial programs that MUST be taken, ones that will build student reading skills…student learning, instead of <i>taking the easy way out</i> by encouraging these paper classes? How about NOT accepting anything below minimum standards and offering ways…options…so student athletes CAN work their way back in…if they are willing to put forth the efforts. You know…you get what you earn…NOT we’ll make it easy for you if you can help us win.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">I know from personal experience that what Mary Willingham describes is not specific to just UNC…but goes on at, likely, many other universities…and in many other forms. In fact, I know of athletes being pressured to “help” other athletes (who are less than capable and not necessarily willing to put forth the effort) in order to make sure they stay eligible…so they can “win” games.</span>
