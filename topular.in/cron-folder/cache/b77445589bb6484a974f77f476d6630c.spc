<blockquote><p>
Once again, Indiana ranks near the bottom in the annual Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a state-by-state survey of ourselves and surroundings. If there’s any good news it’s that Indiana rose two notches to 46th place.</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>Using measures of purpose, social interaction, financial security, community pride and health, the index attempts to help communities and businesses make decisions on health care and job productivity. If you feel good about yourself, have pride in your community, have supportive relationships and believe your life has purpose, then you are likely a healthy, productive person. The measures intertwine.</p>
<p>Indiana consistently has been in the bottom 10 in the index. Its highest ranking was 38th in 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p>The criteria (and Indiana&#8217;s rank) are:<br />
PURPOSE (39): Liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals<br />
SOCIAL (41): Having supportive relationships and love in your life<br />
FINANCIAL (33): Managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security.<br />
COMMUNITY (44): Liking where you live, feeling safe and having pride in your community<br />
PHYSICAL (46): Having good health and enough energy to get things done daily.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t surprise me that, even though it isn&#8217;t great, Indiana performs best on the financial category. We allow ourselves to prioritize working for money. Observing the attitudes of Hoosiers over the years, I suspect many of our citizens view the other stuff as, on some level, frivolous. Certainly not something we support the government spending money on. </p>
<p>Hawaii, Alaska, Montana, Colorado, and Wyoming end up with the best scores while Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and West Virginia make up the bottom five.  </p>

<blockquote><p>(a) A person may not use a telecommunications device to:(1) type a text message or an electronic mail message;(2) transmit a text message or an electronic mail message; or (3) read a text message or an electronic mail message;while operating a moving motor vehicle unless the device is used in conjunction with hands free or voice operated technology, or unless the device is used to call 911 to report a bona fide emergency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, the officer stopped the suspect because the guy was messing with his phone on the highway. After the stop, the officer found 5 pounds of heroin in the guy&#8217;s car. But, it turned out the suspect wasn&#8217;t texting; rather, he was looking for music &#8212; which, as the law is written, is not illegal. The 7th Circuit determined that the officer did not have probable cause to stop the car and, therefore, the search was illegal. The State argued that since the guy was looking at his phone, and not the road, while driving, the officer had probable cause to stop the vehicle. The 7th Circuit disagreed. The law only prohibits texting and looking at e-mail. That means there are a great number of legal activities in which the driver could have been engaged while looking at his phone (e.g. making and receiving phone calls, inputting addresses, reading driving directions and maps with GPS applications, reading news and weather programs, retrieving and playing music or audio books, surfing the Internet, playing video games—even watching movies or television.) The officer had no probable cause to believe the motorist was engaged in texting rather than one of those legal activities.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, I <a href="http://www.masson.us/blog/sb-18-texting-while-driving/">commented</a> on a bill that had language similar to the language that ultimately passed: </p>
<blockquote><p>
This bill highlights some of the difficulties in drafting legislation. Sometimes it’s tough to keep up with technology. The bill changes the definition of “telecommunications device” to include “The term includes a: (1) wireless telephone; (2) personal digital assistant; (3) pager; or (4) text messaging device.” But, at times, you’ll find the difficulty of keeping up with new technology is really a matter of confusing the bottle with the wine. Often enough, even if the drafter recognizes this problem, there isn’t much to be done if the courts or the legislator are focused on the bottle.</p>
<p>In this case, the problem being addressed is the fact that the driver isn’t paying attention to the road. Whether the attention is focused on a text message, a cell phone, a book, a CD case, a map, or a screaming child isn’t terribly important in terms of the actual risk of driving while not paying attention. But, the way the politics are set up and probably the way the case law has developed, simply attempting to penalize “driving while distracted” probably would not be effective, even though that’s the real problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, maybe back to the drawing board on this law. </p>

James Whitcomb, the Mexican American War, and Education in Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>James Whitcomb (1843 – 1848)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Whitcomb">James Whitcomb</a> moved from Kentucky to Bloomington, Indiana at the age of 26 where he established a law practice and became the Monroe County Prosecutor. Elected to the state Senate in 1830, he was an outspoken opponent of the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. That along with the fact that he was a Methodist placed him well to run against Governor Bigger in 1843. (Some of Presbyterian Gov. Bigger&#8217;s comments in the 1830s about the educational competency of Methodists had alienated that group.) Whitcomb won the election by 2,000 votes out of 120,000 cast. Significantly &#8211; given how close the election was &#8211; 1,600 votes went to the newly formed Liberty Party which ran on an anti-slavery platform.</p>
<p>Whitcomb&#8217;s first term was devoted to addressing the State&#8217;s financial situation. Measures taken during Bigger&#8217;s tenure, a somewhat improving economy, and Whitcomb&#8217;s cuts to state employee compensation helped improve the state government&#8217;s financial outlook. During his term, he advocated for the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_School_for_the_Deaf">Indiana School for the Deaf</a> and a state mental asylum. Both initiatives were successful, but funding would have to wait until further recovery of the state&#8217;s financial prospects.</p>
<p>The State had made some recovery on its finances at the time of Whitcomb&#8217;s re-election bid, and he defeated Whig Joseph Marshall and Liberty candidate Stephen Stevens. However, despite the improvement on the debt situation, discussions were underway with Charles Butler, a representative of eastern and foreign bondholders to whom Indiana remained indebted. Butler had successfully negotiated a restructuring in Michigan which had similar internal improvement financial problems &#8212; also exacerbated by the Panic of 1837 and also involving the sketchy Morris Canal and Banking Company. In 1845, Butler <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=Morris+Canal+and+Banking+Company+of+New+Jersey+indiana+mammoth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z2Ko_xmd6o&amp;sig=79dwXrJfZsY95Ul5z4tB6-_sgw8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP2cHc7tzKAhXLshQKHfn2B-AQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20Canal%20and%20Banking%20Company%20of%20New%20Jersey%20indiana%20mammoth&amp;f=false">began negotiations</a>. Prior to the legislative session in December of 1845, Morris gave a speech in Terre Haute where he proposed that a tax should be imposed dedicated to partial repayment of the bonds. The bondholders, in turn, would take the Wabash &amp; Erie&#8217;s revenues for the other half. He persuaded Governor Whitcomb of his plan and, together, they lobbied local and legislative leaders.</p>
<p>For his part, Butler attempted to scold Indiana for paying local contractors before paying bondholders and cast the State&#8217;s debt repayment obligations in moral terms, making much of the &#8220;widows and orphans who held Indiana bonds and depended on regular interest payments.&#8221; After some rough and tumble debate (one Senator called Butler&#8217;s style of writing and thought as &#8220;frothy and bombastic&#8221;) the legislature passed a bill in early 1847 that provided for payment of half of the bond obligation and traded control and revenues of the Wabash &amp; Erie for the remainder. The debt still consumed about half of the State&#8217;s revenues, but it was becoming more manageable.</p>
<p><em>Mexican-American War</em></p>
<p>In 1846, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War">Mexican-American War</a> broke out.  Initially, it would seem that Indiana would have difficulty meeting its obligation to supply soldiers. The militia system had been largely abandoned as the Native Americans had been pushed out of the state. The state&#8217;s arsenal was basically empty, and its militia was dubbed the &#8220;cornstalk militia,&#8221; with soldiers supposedly drilling with cornstalks as rifles and tassels in their caps.</p>
<p>In May, the Department of War <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v4E-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA497&amp;lpg=PA497&amp;dq=indiana+%22cornstalk+militia%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JN-rluqmd_&amp;sig=_0BieFq8MQrV0tbrb9nv8Le_294&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAq_nH8-XKAhUGNiYKHVxWCWQQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=indiana%20%22cornstalk%20militia%22&amp;f=false">sent a letter to the Governor</a> requiring three regiments.The conflict was unexpected, the State had not appropriated money for the resulting expenses, and the State&#8217;s credit was ruined so it could not borrow for the necessary equipment.  Three regiments meant that 2,811 men had to be organized. However, a patriotic desire to plant the Star Spangled Banner on the Halls of Montezuma helped. Lew Wallace, then 19 years old, had a company organized in Indianapolis within 3 days. Men began to pour into Camp Clark (east of New Albany) from all over the state. Several branches of the State Bank made money available to fund the effort, and Indiana was able to meet its quota within 19 days. One unfortunate episode of the Indiana Brigade involved a mistake by the Second Indiana Regiment which was ordered to retreat when they should have held or advanced with the rest of the troops, apparently turning the battle in favor of the Mexicans under Santa Ana at Vera Cruz on February 23, 1847. Later in 1847, Indiana was asked to and did provide a fourth and fifth regiment. The U.S. won the war against Mexico and, by July 1848, the troops were back home. &#8220;A season of barbecues followed, the battle flags were presented to the State among solemn ceremonials, and the chapter was closed.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Education</em></p>
<p>In the 1840s, the state of education in Indiana remained more aspirational than real. The federal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Ordinance_of_1785">Land Ordinance of 1785</a> provided that section 16 in each township would be set aside to support schools. The ordinance required surveyors to divide land into townships that were six miles square. Within each township, there were to be thirty-six sections, each a mile square. According to the ordinance,  &#8220;there shall be reserved the lot No. 16, of every township, for the maintenance of public schools within the said township.&#8221; Meanwhile, Indiana&#8217;s constitution of 1816 promised that the state would create, &#8220;as soon as circumstances permit,&#8221; a &#8220;general system of education, ascending in regular gradation, from township schools to state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.&#8221; However, as of the 1840s, education of Indiana was haphazard and not much of a system at all. It ranked lower than some Southern states and all of the northern states in terms of literacy &#8212; 18 out of 28 states overall. Less than a quarter of children between five and fifteen attended school. 14.3% of adult Hoosiers were illiterate compared to a national average of 11.6%. By 1850, its literacy rank among the states had dropped to 23rd. Part of this is attributable to settlement patterns. A lot of the state&#8217;s settlers had come from the upland South which was not known to have a strong tradition of literacy.</p>
<p>However, during the 1840s, an effort was made to turn the aspiration of public education into a reality. A prime mover in this effort was a Presbyterian missionary from the east by the name of <a href="https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/1001/04_ch_two_doc.pdf?sequence=4">Caleb Mills</a> whose six &#8220;One of the People&#8221; addresses helped culminate in the School Law of 1852. Mills was not alone in his efforts, rather he was part of a network of reformers working throughout the Midwest to improve education. Mills became familiar with the state of education in Indiana when he took a two year leave of absence from his studies at Andover Theological Seminary to institute Sunday School programs in northern Kentucky and southern Indiana.  In 1833, after graduating from Andover, Mills took a position at &#8220;Wabash Manual Labor College and Teacher&#8217;s Seminary&#8221; in Crawfordsville.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, in 1846, Mills wrote the first of his &#8220;One of the People&#8221; papers. It was <a href="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8167/10047">published</a> in the <em>Indiana State Journal</em> in 1846 on the second day of the 1846 General Assembly under the title of &#8220;An Address to the Legislature.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>[Mills] pointed to Indiana&#8217;s lamentable inadequacy in the vital field of education, then passed to concrete consideration of particular evils and of remedies. Public funds at that time devoted to schools came largely from the federal land grant of one section in each congressional township. The money derived from these sections was not consolidated and then distributed equally throughout the state; instead each township kept whatever it could realize from its own section. Thus the very communities that most needed public assistance and could least afford to support schools from local funds, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, communities where land values were low and farms poor, in fact received the least help from the land donation; prosperous townships got the highest incomes from their more valuable lands. Such inefficient use of the funds must be rectified, said the Address, by equal state-wide distribution. Furthermore and even more significant, the really basic support for free schools must be raised by taxation. Finally, only if higher schools improve will well-trained teachers be available; therefore let the county seminaries and the state university be reorganized. Sell all the physical facilities of the seminaries and of the university; distribute the interest on the proceeds to one private seminary in each county and to every college whose governors will agree to maintain certain stipulated standards, to train teachers, and to devote the money received to provide prospective teachers with free tuition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mills was joined by Governor Whitcomb who, in his annual address to the legislature,&#8221;urged that body to revise the entire school system and place it under the charge of a state superintendent.&#8221;</p>
<p>No legislation resulted; however, in May 1847, the General Assembly called a state common school convention presided over by state Supreme Court Chief Justice, Isaac Blackford. The result was work produced by two committees. One was a public relations effort that explained the state of public education in Indiana and recommended the allocation of additional funds to education, that Indiana public schools should be free to students, that schools and teacher standards should be uniform, and that a superintendent of common schools should be established. The second committee produced draft legislation for consideration by the Indiana General Assembly calling for a poll tax, an organized system of superintendents and trustees, and a referendum upon the issue of common schools. That work, in conjunction with a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JDGIV2_X0pgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">second address by Mill</a>s published during the General Assembly&#8217;s work in December 1847 resulted in a referendum in the 1848 election wherein a majority of Hoosiers expressed support for the idea of a system of common schools.</p>
<p>Mills third address framed the results of the referendum for consideration by the 1848 General Assembly. He pointed to the strong correlation between a county&#8217;s high illiteracy rate and hostility to a system for common schools. Despite the negative votes, the majority of positive votes was &#8220;a cause for encouragement on the part of education advocates in the Hoosier state: &#8216;There was more genuine patriotism in the school vote of last August than was ever expressed at the ballot box since she [Indiana] became a sovereign state.'&#8221; The legislature passed a school law in 1848 which used taxation to support common schools and equalized the period of instruction for township schools. However, its effect was limited because it allowed counties to opt out, and, additionally, school funds were not consolidated and distributed equally among communities. After 29 counties rejected the 1848 system, Mills fourth address was focused on criticism of the 1848 law. The fifth appeal was directed at the Constitutional convention that led to the 1851 constitution. That document provided for “a general and uniform system of common schools, wherein tuition shall be without charge and equally open to all.” Finally, in 1852, the General Assembly adopted the School Law of 1852 which &#8220;established a common school fund, a centralized system of school organization, and a Superintendent of Public Instruction— all features Mills’ had strongly supported in his address. The 1852 law did not fully incorporate Mills’ proposals for graded schools and normal schools to standardize education and teacher training.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The education saga sort of straddles the time period had artificially set for this segment of my bicentennial series. So, to return briefly to Governor Whitcomb&#8217;s administration: before the end of his term, Governor Whitcomb was elected to the U.S. Senate by the state legislature and was replaced by Paris Dunning on December 26, 1848. Shortly before leaving office, in his December 1848 address to the legislature, Governor Whitcomb  <a href="http://www.in.gov/history/files/const1851.pdf">advocated for a new state constitution</a>.  Among the issues he regarded as being crucial to address was the proliferation of local and special legislation, assumption of public debt, and a change to a biennial rather than annual meeting of the General Assembly. More on that in Installment 4 of this Bicentennial series where I hope to address the convention for the 1851 Constitution and the onset of the Civil War.</p>

<blockquote><p>
&#8220;It is safe to say that the 2015 ISTEP+ program is a work in progress, put in place quickly and without the usual procedures (e.g., field testing) used with most new assessment programs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>State Board of Education executive director John Snethen challenged that sentence, asking &#8220;why is it safe to say this? This is an example of a statement that could cause concern.&#8221; The sentence was removed from the draft. Snethen did not comment for the story. The SBOE assures us that his involvement was purely about making the highly technical report understandable for us rubes. (I paraphrase). The consulting company was a little more forthcoming and indicated that SBOE was concerned about messaging. Where possible, SBOE would prefer a &#8220;glass half full&#8221; message. I&#8217;m sure they would. </p>
<p>This test was in trouble from the start. The value of these tests is dubious in the first place. Then the State dumped Common Core for reasons that seem to have much less to do with its substance than with an emotional response to a perceived &#8220;federal takeover.&#8221; This, in turn, caused the state to rush out an untested test &#8212; on which we&#8217;ve wasted many millions of dollars without producing anything of value to students. (Remember them?) </p>
<blockquote><p>The changes made by Snethen also suggest the Pence administration is cautious of possible backlash to the new academic standards, which were put in place after Indiana became the first state to withdraw from the Common Core standards in 2014. Conservative critics say the national math and English benchmarks that describe what students should know after completing each grade amount to a federal takeover of education, and Oklahoma, South Carolina and Louisiana officials also have taken steps to drop Common Core.</p>
<p>. . . </p>
<p>The ISTEP+ test, which features Indiana-specific academic standards, was hastily rolled out in early 2015. Educators balked, saying it would take a staggering 12 hours to complete; the GOP-controlled Legislature passed a bill shortening the exam before students ever took the test. And some students who later took it online reported computer glitches, which were found to have an impact on their performance.</p>
<p>Others have raised questions about whether the test was scored properly or even an accurate assessment, leading the state Board of Education to call for the investigation, which state officials said would be independent when it launched April. </p></blockquote>
<p>Half-empty or half-filled, we should probably be asking what it is that the glass is full of. </p>

Noah Noble; 3.3: Indiana&#8217;s Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836; and 3.4: Governor Wallace and Indian removal in Indiana. This short installment will look at Gov. Samuel Bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Samuel Bigger (1840 – 1843)</strong></p>
<p>By 1840, the disastrous financial consequences of the Panic of 1837 and the Internal Improvement financing was being fully felt in Indiana. The Whigs decided not to nominate Wallace, their sitting governor, and instead nominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Bigger#Governor">Samuel Bigger</a> who had no connection to the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. The Democratic nominee, Tilghman Howard, had been in the General Assembly at the time of the Act and had voted for it. Bigger claimed to never have supported the Internal Improvement Act. (Given its general popularity at the time, this seems at least somewhat dubious.) Bigger was also aided by the fact that William Henry Harrison was on the ballot as the Whig Presidential candidate. Harrison&#8217;s reputation in the state had improved with the rose-colored glasses of hindsight, and he had become something of a folk hero. Despite the state&#8217;s financial struggles, the Whigs retained majorities in the legislature, and Bigger defeated Tilghman.</p>
<p>Bigger&#8217;s honeymoon didn&#8217;t last long. the State&#8217;s payment on its debt was double its revenues. The state soon defaulted on payments and, in an effort to come to grips with the situation, the State imposed a massive tax increase (apparently up to a 300% increase in some places). Efforts were made to complete the improvements, the Wabash &amp; Erie in particular, in order to capture revenues from the improvements. However, those efforts did not make a sufficient dent in the debt.</p>
<p>In 1841, Bigger &#8212; a lawyer and former circuit court judge &#8212; rewrote Indiana&#8217;s code of laws with the assistance of state treasurer George Dunn. This was apparently the Indiana Code&#8217;s first major reorganization since 1824, and I believe the system for updating it from year-to-year as the General Assembly amends it dates from the 1841 reorganization.</p>
<p>Bigger&#8217;s re-election prospects, likely challenging under the circumstances in any event, were not helped by the surfacing of anti-Methodist quotes Bigger had made <a href="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8239/10191">some years earlier</a> when he was in the legislature. Early Methodist thought in the state had been cool on the idea of higher education. The denomination had reconsidered that position but, by the 1830s, Presbyterians dominated higher education in Indiana. Presbyterians controlled the Board of Trustees and faculty at Indiana College in Bloomington. They had also founded Hanover and Wabash. Methodists, having concluded that higher education was necessary to retain young people and advance their church, were trying to gain representation in Bloomington. Methodists outnumbering Presbyterians in the state on the order of 4-to-1, their strategy in 1834 was to attempt to have the legislature select the university board. At the time of that debate, Bigger &#8211; a Presbyterian &#8211; was a lawyer and a representative from Rushville. He vocally doubted the ability of American Methodists to manage a &#8220;literary institution,&#8221; claiming that when his <em>alma mater</em> of Ohio University wanted a Methodist professor, they had to send to Europe to acquire one. Bigger said there was &#8220;not a Methodist in America with sufficient learning to fill a professor&#8217;s chair.&#8221; When he ran for re-election in 1843, this came back to bite him.</p>
<p>Methodists, in particular a professor by the name of Matthew Simpson, were chafing over favorable financial treatment by the legislature for Presbyterian Wabash College. Additionally, a Presbyterian dominated convention on education was seen by the Methodists as an attempt by Presbyterians to gain control of the common schools &#8212; which, at that point, were not uniformly organized under Indiana law. Simpson dredged up the contemptuous way in which Bigger had spoken about Methodists. The Democrats, who had nominated Methodist James Whitcomb, <a href="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/8239/10191">saw an opportunity</a> to dislodge a chunk of the normally pro-Whig Methodists in favor of the Democrats.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The <span class="italic">Indiana State Sentinel</span></em>, a Democratic paper published in Indianapolis, opened the campaign with a cleverly conceived rumor that the Whigs were attacking Whitcomb because he was a Methodist. <em>The Lafayette <span class="italic">Advertiser</span></em>, also Democratic, confirmed the charges, adding that his being a Methodist ought to be &#8220;a recommendation instead of an objection.&#8221; &#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed the <span class="italic">Advertiser</span> piously, &#8220;has it come to that, that a desperate political press shall urge it as an objection to James Whitcomb … that he is a Christian!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Responding volleys by Whig newspapers such as the <em>Indiana State Journal</em> were unable to stem the tide. Given the State&#8217;s financial condition, it is difficult to say whether Bigger would have been re-elected in any case, but this campaign issue certainly did not help his cause.</p>
<p>I do not have a good segue for this, but it seems worth mentioning that by this point, the demographics of Indiana <a href="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/viewFile/8078/9870">were changing</a>. The early population of Indiana came along the Ohio River, mostly from Kentucky and parts south. In 1840, about 80% of the population was concentrated in the southern counties. </p>
<blockquote><p>In 1840, the largest city in Indiana was New Albany, with 4,226 people. Indianapolis had a population of 2,692, Richmond 2,070, and Crawfordsville 1,327. Ten years later the New Albany-Jeffersonville area contained slightly over ten thousand people. The second largest city was Madison with 9,007 people, and third was Indianapolis with a population of 8,091.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the Indians were forced out, settlers were less likely to come from the southern U.S. and more likely to come down the Wabash or up from the Ohio along the Great Miami River, Whitewater River, and even the National Road. These settlers would tend to come from points east, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. This seems to be the path taken by my family. I&#8217;m not a great genealogist, but this is generally the path the Massons seem to have taken. Mansfield B. Masson was born in Pennsylvania in 1805 and, in the 1830s was working in or around Pittsburgh. By 1847, he was in Cincinnati. His son, James P. Masson had moved to Indianapolis by the 1860s. And, even as the population was coming west, it was more common for trade to head east. With the opening of the Wabash &amp; Erie Canal, crops would apparently go by wagon to Lafayette and then shipped up to northeastern markets such as New York and Boston. Chicago was even emerging as a market, though that was still a long wagon ride.</p>
<blockquote>
<div data-canvas-width="91.827">One account of early Chicago describes Hoosier wagons loaded with various kinds of produce which was traded for a few bags of coffee and the balance in salt; “this was the invariable return load of all Hoosiers.” The same observer claimed to have seen as many as 160 Hoosier wagons at once on the dry ground east of State Street in Chicago.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In any event, Central Indiana was starting to emerge as a vital part of the Indiana economy, and its connections to other regions of the United States was more varied than the early settlers in the southern part of the state. (Swamps and speculators seemed to have discouraged development in northern Indiana to some extent.)

<p><strong>David Wallace (1837-1840)</strong></p>
<p>In 1837, Noah Noble&#8217;s Lieutenant Governor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wallace_(Indiana_politician)">David Wallace</a> was elected as Indiana&#8217;s 6th Governor. (Wallace was the father of Civil War general, New Mexico governor, and author of Ben Hur, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lew_Wallace">Lew Wallace</a>.) David Wallace was elected before the financial depression hit and while the internal improvement act was still popular. However, things quickly went south for him and his term was dominated by the State&#8217;s financial struggles. As the Panic of 1837 disrupted the financial markets, property values plummeted, and construction on the internal improvements stopped; Wallace had the unenviable task of informing the legislature that the state&#8217;s credit had been exhausted and Indiana would soon be insolvent. By the end of his term in 1840, the state&#8217;s income covered only 20% of its expenditures—interest on the massive state debt being over two-thirds of the budget.</p>

<p>During Wallace&#8217;s tenure,  much of Indiana&#8217;s final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removals_in_Indiana">Indian removals</a> took place. In 1830, during the Jackson Presidency, the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/indian-treaties">Indian Removal Act</a> had been passed by Congress, making Indiana&#8217;s actions in this respect part of a nationwide trend (at least east of the Mississippi). &#8220;The Act established a process whereby the President could grant land west of the Mississippi River to Indian tribes that agreed to give up their homelands. As incentives, the law allowed the Indians financial and material assistance to travel to their new locations and start new lives and guaranteed that the Indians would live on their new property under the protection of the United States Government forever.&#8221; (Side note: the Supreme Court case of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_v._M%27Intosh">Johnson v. M&#8217;Intosh</a></em> suggests that the Founders&#8217; language about property rights being natural, inalienable, and independent of government as mostly happy talk that nobody believed in when it came to the property rights of Native Americans. As Chief Justice Marshall observed, &#8220;title to lands . . .  must be admitted to depend entirely on the law of the nation in which they lie[.]&#8221;)</p>
<p>Native American lands in Indiana had been ceded at various times, with the largest chunk coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_St._Mary%27s">Treaty of St. Mary&#8217;s</a> in 1818. Among other things, that treaty required the United States to pay an annuity of silver to the Miami Indians. Shrewd and unscrupulous traders were able to make fortunes on the backs of such annuities. The general practice was to sell goods to the Indians on credit and then, when the annuity payments were set to come in, the traders would submit (often inflated) claims to the Indian agent who would pay the claims out of the annual Indian annuity payment, sometimes bypassing the Native Americans entirely. By the 1830s, the major tribes left in Indiana were the Potawatomi and the Miami. In 1838, the Potawatomi were removed from Indiana to Kansas in a forced march dubbed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potawatomi_Trail_of_Death">Trail of Death.</a> The march started in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Lakes,_Indiana">Twin Lakes</a>, Indiana and ended near Osawatomie, Kansas. Pursuant to treaties that were, to some extent, disputed, the Potawatomi had agreed to give up their land and move west. When they refused to vacate the territory, Governor Wallace authorized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tipton">John Tipton</a> to mobilize a militia to forcibly remove them:</p>
<blockquote><p>On August 30, 1838, General Tipton and his volunteer militia surprised the Potawatomi village at Twin Lakes. When Makkahtahmoway, Chief Black Wolf&#8217;s elderly mother, heard the soldiers firing their rifles she was so badly frightened that she hid in the nearby woods for six days. Unable to walk with a wounded foot, she was found by another Indian, who was looking for his horse, and brought to South Bend.<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;"> </span>Upon his arrival Tipton allegedly called for a meeting at the village chapel, where he detained the Potawatomi chiefs as prisoners. Although Father Petit was in South Bend at the time of the militia’s arrival, he later protested that the Potawatomi had been taken by surprise under &#8220;the ruse of calling a council.&#8221;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;"> </span>Tipton reported that several of the Potawatomi had already gathered near the chapel when he arrived, but acknowledged that the Potawatomi were not allowed to leave &#8220;until matters were amicably settled&#8221; and they had agreed to give up their Indiana land.</p>
<p>Between Thursday, August 30, and Monday, September 3, 1838, the day before their departure, Tipton and his militia surrounded Menominee&#8217;s village at Twin Lakes, gathered the remaining Potawatomi together, and made preparations for their removal to Kansas.<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;"> </span>The names of the Potawatomi heads of families and other individuals, which numbered 859 in all, were recorded on tribal registration rolls.<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;"> </span>In addition, the soldiers burned the crops and destroyed the Potawatomi village, which consisted of approximately 100 structures, to discourage them from trying to return.<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;"> </span>Father Petit closed the mission church at Menominee&#8217;s village, explaining in a letter to his family dated September 14, 1838, &#8220;It is sad, I assure you, for a missionary to see a young and vigorous work expire in his arms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(See <a href="https://www.potawatomi.org/news/1441-chronicling-the-potawatomi-trail-of-death-letter-from-benjamin-marie-petit-to-bishop-brute-november-13-1838">here</a> for an account by Father Petit). During the 660-mile, two-month journey to Kansas, 28 children and 14 adults died. In Indiana, the route went south through Rochester to Logansport, then along the northern banks of the Wabash through Delphi, Lafayette, and Williamsport then west to the Illinois border &#8212; at times traveling down the Michigan Road along territory they had ceded in the 1826 treaty.</p>
<p>The Miamis held on somewhat longer. In fact, a good number were allowed to stay, and a fair amount of land was allotted (or, depending on your view &#8212; given as a bribe) to tribal leaders. For example, 43 members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Richardville">Jean Baptiste Richardville&#8217;s</a> family were given special consideration. Richardville was the nephew of the Miami war chief, Little Turtle by way of Little Turtle&#8217;s sister, Tacamwa, a French fur trader. He became a trader and controlled the portage between the Maumee River (which drains into the Great Lakes) and the Wabash (which ultimately drains into the Gulf of Mexico). The <a href="http://www.oocities.org/heartland/valley/7029/portage.html">Maumee-Wabash Portage</a> was an important piece of territory. It was described as the only &#8220;land barrier&#8221; separating the fur traders of Quebec from the fur merchants in New Orleans. Fort Wayne was established to assist the Americans in controlling that vital piece of geography. Due to his influence where he negotiated for the Miami, in various treaties, Richardville received 44 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_section">quarter sections</a> of Indiana land (over 7,000 acres) in separate allotments. By his death in 1841, he was considered the wealthiest man in Indiana. When the Indiana Miamis were removed in 1846, it was only about half of them that went west to Kansas, leaving from Peru, Indiana and traveling west by canal boat and steamboat. About 323 members were removed with six dying along the way.</p>

<p><em>Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836</em></p>
<div id="attachment_10700" style="width: 383px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.masson.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Mammoth_Improvenment_Act_Projects.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-10700"><img class=" wp-image-10700" src="http://www.masson.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Mammoth_Improvenment_Act_Projects.jpg" alt="The Indiana Mammoth Improvement Act of 1836" width="373" height="582" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Indiana Mammoth Improvement Act of 1836</p></div>
<p>The Indiana Gazetteer of 1849 said of Noble and the Internal Improvement Act, &#8220;Gov. Noble, too, was unfortunate in being, if not the father, at least the most efficient promoter of the system of Internal Improvements, from which the State has suffered so much in both character and resources.&#8221; (That, dear reader, is foreshadowing.)</p>
<p>The initial idea of the bill was to continue funding the development of the Wabash &amp; Erie Canal. But this met with resistance because legislators in other parts of the state did not see much benefit to their locality from the Wabash &amp; Erie. Lawmakers attempted without success to pass comprehensive internal improvement legislation in 1834 and 1835. Part of what paved the way for successful passage was <a href="http://econweb.umd.edu/~wallis/MyPapers/Indiana%20and%20the%20Property%20Tax.pdf">an overhaul of the tax system in 1835</a>. Prior to 1835, Indiana&#8217;s two primary taxes were a per-acre property tax and a poll tax. The 1835 legislation shifted the per-acre tax to an <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_valorem_tax">ad valorem</a></em> tax.</p>
<p>Rather than taxing all acres equally (or in Indiana&#8217;s case in three tiers of 80, 60, or 40 cents per acre), the <em>ad valorem</em> tax is figured as a percentage of the real property&#8217;s value. Shifting to this type of tax resulted in agricultural land being taxed less and urban areas (a relative term at this point &#8211; &#8220;urban&#8221; was still pretty rustic) taxed more. The nature of cities and towns is that they crop up at transportation junctions. The counties where canals and highways would be built would primarily be places with towns. The <em>ad valorem</em> tax would result in higher taxes for places with towns. But they were willing to bet that the value of added infrastructure would offset the added taxes. For their part, the agricultural areas which would not benefit as much from major infrastructure projects were more inclined to vote for the infrastructure if their tax burden would decrease or, at least, not significantly increase.</p>
<p>Legislators also had some reason for optimism about increased tax revenue. Federal legislation prohibited Indiana (and other states admitted between 1803 and 1821) from taxing land for the first five years after the sale of the public land to a private individual. The State had been selling a lot of land in the five years prior to 1836 and anticipated a lot of new land (subject to the new <em>ad valorem</em> tax) to be coming on-line very quickly.</p>
<p>With respect to the internal improvement legislation, I&#8217;m not sure whether to go with the log rolling, snowball, or Christmas tree metaphor here, but I&#8217;m sure everyone gets the idea. The scope of the project got pretty big to satisfy the various regional interests. For the Ohio River population, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincennes_Trace">Vincennes Trace</a> would be paved. The Lafayette Pike would run from New Albany to Lafayette. The Michigan Road would be paved. There would be funding for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Central_Canal">Central Canal</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater_Canal">Whitewater Canal</a> in the East. And there would be railroads! One from Madison to Indianapolis, and another from Indianapolis to Lafayette.</p>
<p>The legislation created an Internal Improvement Board, authorized to borrow up to $10 million on top of the $2 million in debt the State already had. Projects would require that $12 million added to about $3 million that had been acquired through land sales. Annual tax revenues at the time were only something like $65,000 per year. This was an extremely ambitious &#8212; possibly foolhardy &#8212; project even in good times. But the Panic of 1837 hit, and helped topple the undertaking. Another piece of the problem was what seems in retrospect to have been a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9DAj3x4TwL0C&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=Morris+Canal+and+Banking+Company+of+New+Jersey+indiana+mammoth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z2Ko_xmd6o&amp;sig=79dwXrJfZsY95Ul5z4tB6-_sgw8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP2cHc7tzKAhXLshQKHfn2B-AQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20Canal%20and%20Banking%20Company%20of%20New%20Jersey%20indiana%20mammoth&amp;f=false">sketchy deal</a> with the Morris Canal and Banking Company whereby Indiana would become indebted on the $10 million in bonds immediately but Morris would pay cash for the bonds in installments over time. Morris marketed the bonds in the U.S. and Europe. (Michigan also seems to have gotten caught up in problems with Morris Canal). Whereas Indiana received only $8.5 million from Morris (and some of that was in worthless securities) the State was, nevertheless, liable to creditors for the full $10 million plus interest and penalties. In 1839, Morris failed to make its installments and construction stopped on the internal improvements. By 1841, Indiana was unable to pay the interest on its bonds.</p>
<p>Most of the improvements, most of which were only partially constructed, were turned over to the creditors. The Vincennes Trace became the Paoli Pike, and was converted into a private toll road for about 30 years. It was never very profitable. The Central Canal was abandoned as a failure. A section of the Whitewater Canal was completed and remained in use for some years. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffersonville,_Madison_and_Indianapolis_Railroad">Madison and Indianapolis Railroad</a> also had some success once completed by private ownership. The Wabash &amp; Erie reached Lafayette in 1843 and began operation that year but, after a decade, it became clear that the canal was not economically viable. Additionally, Indiana <a href="http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/collection-guides/wabash-and-erie-canal-company.pdf">had assigned</a> the Wabash &amp; Erie to a private trust for the benefit of the bondholders who, in turn, assumed half of the State&#8217;s bond debt. Technology developing how it did, and the State no longer having an interest in the canal, future State policies ended up being more favorable to railroads, undercutting the interests of the privately held canal.</p>
<p>However, even as ill-fated as the internal improvement legislation turned out to be, the resulting transportation infrastructure increased land values and productivity for Hoosiers, particularly in and around the terminus areas of the various projects.</p>

Now to look at Governor Noble and the state at the beginning of this period.</p>
<p><strong>Noah Noble (1832-1837)</strong></p>
<p>Indiana&#8217;s 5th Governor, Noah Noble, was an example of early industrial and financial enterprise in the State. Most of the pioneering people focused on agricultural pursuits (often pork and corn as cash crops) but needed access to markets, capital, finished goods, and methods for processing their own produce in a manner suitable for shipping and trading. Noble, in addition to being a land speculator in Brookville, was the owner of a trading company that purchased produce from area farmers and shipped them to New Orleans. I don&#8217;t know the particulars of his business, but there was often a lack of access to cash and credit, so the local merchant became sort of a fledgling banking operation. Providing goods on credit to local farmers, giving them a local means of trading their goods, and interacting with markets and manufacturers further away. This was not guaranteed profit by any means, a boating accident in 1819 destroyed an entire shipment and left him in debt for many years. Noble also operated a water powered weaving mill with a wool carding machine.</p>
<p>Noah was active in Franklin County politics, and his brother was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Noble_(senator)">Senator James Noble</a>, a member of Indiana&#8217;s first constitutional convention. His brother&#8217;s influence got him the job of Receiver of Public Moneys in the Indiana Land Office which put him in touch with influential people in the State. (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gxIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=noah+noble+campaign+1834+james+read&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GWShKit7gV&amp;sig=iAQmAmVVPFPL9QFFh-LKzqkkomY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiauObVgezKAhXi74MKHW5vDaQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20noble%20campaign%201834%20james%20read&amp;f=false">Apparently</a> his other, younger brother Lazarus had previously held the position but died while moving the land office from Brookville to Indianapolis). When Andrew Jackson got elected, the nature of the spoils system was such that Noble was bounced from his job. However, he was soon appointed to the commission that laid out the Michigan Road.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, early Indiana government policy had a strong focus on transportation. Economic activity is largely useless if you don&#8217;t have the means to connect people and markets. You have to be able to get your pigs and corn to people who have a use for them, and the means to pay for them. The Michigan Road was an early state effort in transportation. In addition, the federal government was building the National Road which eventually ran east-to-west from Richmond (by way of Cumberland, Maryland) through Indianapolis to Terre Haute (and on into Illinois). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Road">Michigan Road</a>  ran north-south from Madison on the Ohio River, up to Indianapolis, and (by way of Logansport at the junction of the Wabash and Eel Rivers and South Bend on the St. Joseph River) to Lake Michigan at the port at Michigan City.</p>
<p>In the election of 1831, Noble was the Whig nominee for governor. On the national level, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)">Whigs</a> had formed in opposition to Andrew Jackson&#8217;s Presidency. Generally speaking, it favored Congress over the Presidency, modernization, banking, and protectionism that favored domestic manufacturing. &#8220;It appealed to entrepreneurs and planters, but had little appeal to farmers or unskilled workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having been chosen to lead the Whigs, Noble won a hard fought race as a Whig against his Democratic opponent, James Read; taking office in December 1831 and holding it until December 1837. He oversaw the completion of survey work on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabash_and_Erie_Canal">Wabash and Erie Canal</a>, and work started on the canal in 1832. Canals were all the rage for a period of time in the U.S.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal">Erie Canal</a>, built to connect New York City to the Great Lakes and opened in 1825 was wildly successful. The proposed Wabash &amp; Erie project, which had its roots in an 1827 Congressional land grant, wasn&#8217;t necessarily popular throughout the Indiana, however. Under the terms of the grant, Indiana was required to start the project within five years and complete it within twenty. &#8220;Many saw the Wabash &amp; Erie Canal as the speculative hobby of Fort Wayne Indian agent John Tipton (who stood to gain a fortune in Indian lands). Few people relished the idea of encumbering the state’s energy and scarce resources with a project in the northern wilderness, while the vast majority of voters and taxpayers stayed quite literally stuck in the mud of southern Indiana’s roads and rivers.&#8221; (Larson, John Lauritz. (2001),<em> Internal Improvement: National Public Works and the Promise of Popular Government in the United States.</em>)</p>
<p>The Wabash &amp; Erie was an effort to connect the Great Lakes to the Ohio River. Nearly 500 miles long, it was the longest canal ever built in North America; eventually running from the Maumee River near Toledo, Ohio down through Fort Wayne, Peru, Logansport, Delphi, Lafayette, and then to Terre Haute and Evansville. By 1837, construction of the canal had reached Logansport.</p>
<p>Noble&#8217;s early efforts for a large scale internal improvement project were met with resistance by the Indiana General Assembly. He wanted money to pave highways and the creation of an Internal Improvement Board to coordinate projects and perhaps save money by buying in bulk. In particular, representatives from the southern part of the state resisted such efforts because the benefits would be experienced by the central and northern part of the state. (However, the southern representatives did agree to a reorganization of the legislature such that it reached its present size of 50 Senators and 100 Representatives, giving the central and northern parts of the state more representation despite the significantly higher population in the south.)</p>
<p>Access to capital continued to be a problem. I mentioned in an earlier installment that financial mismanagement, overly ambitious projects, and the national economy led to the demise of early banking in Indiana. For many years, the state relied on local branches of the Bank of the United States. However, Andrew Jackson got mad at the Bank of the United States and, like many things that got on Old Hickory&#8217;s bad side, it died. (Jackson had a variety of reasons for opposing the bank &#8211; personal, political, economic philosophy, and Constitutional philosophy). Lacking banking options, the state created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Indiana">Bank of Indiana</a> with branches in Indianapolis, Lawrenceburg, Richmond, Madison, New Albany, Vincennes, Bedford, Terre Haute, and Lafayette. The State owned 50% of the bank stock, financed through land sales and the other 50% was owned by private investors, who bought stock with about 1/3 of the purchase price paid up front and the remainder paid back on credit backed by the State. Start up money was in hard currency, Spanish and Mexican silver dollars. (Spanish dollars were legal tender in the U.S. until the Coinage Act of 1857 &#8212; one legacy of which, apparently, was the pricing of New York Stock Exchange listings in units of 1/8ths of a dollar (1/8 being a &#8216;bit&#8217;) until 1997.) The struggle to create the state bank left political scars. When the General Assembly of 1832 could not agree on a plan, there was an upheaval in the election of 1833 where only one Senator was re-elected and twenty-five new Representatives were elected. According to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gxIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=noah+noble+campaign+1834+james+read&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GWShKit7gV&amp;sig=iAQmAmVVPFPL9QFFh-LKzqkkomY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiauObVgezKAhXi74MKHW5vDaQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=noah%20noble%20campaign%201834%20james%20read&amp;f=false">one author</a>, &#8220;the old leaders who had dominated the General Assembly since 1816 disappeared. The pioneer period of Indiana history was ended, so far as the State legislature was concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noble&#8217;s campaign for a second term was a rematch against James Read which he ultimately won. While neither seems to have been especially partisan, Read&#8217;s support came from the &#8220;Jacksonian Triangle&#8221; between Madison, Indianapolis, and Evansville. An item of controversy in the election was Noble&#8217;s sale of one of his father-in-law&#8217;s slaves. He had apparently been traveling with her from Virginia and stopped in Brookville for a couple of days. After that, he took her to Kentucky where it was expected that her owner would follow. The father-in-law later changed his plans and instructed Noble to sell her which he did in 1820. Because she had been in a free-state, this was characterized by Noble&#8217;s Democratic opponents as him selling her back into slavery.  There is also <a href="http://www.nkyviews.com/boone/pdf/boone_slave_narrative.pdf">speculation</a> that the Magruders, slaves of the Noble family, who were freed and relocated to a cabin at Noble and Market Streets in Indianapolis were the inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin">Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</a>. Slavery did not endear him to the eastern, Quaker-heavy parts of the state, but he managed to win anyway. The re-election was seen as partially a rejection of President Jackson and partially as a vote of support for the internal improvement policies of Gov. Noble.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.masson.us/blog/bicentennial-installment-2-indiana-as-a-young-state/">Installment 2: Indiana as a Young State (1816-1832)</a></p>
<p>This time, I&#8217;ll  cover generally the period from 1832-1848, a period marked by economic turbulence, development of transportation infrastructure, a revamped approach to property taxes, the removal of Native Americans from the state, and the beginnings of a general system of public education.</p>
<p>I am going to try something a little different for installment 3. My general plan has been to write installments once a month during Indiana&#8217;s bicentennial year covering, more or less, 16 year periods. Installment 3 came in at about 6,300 words which is a little gratuitous in the blogging world. So, I&#8217;m going to break it up into chunks, release them over the next several days, and see how it goes. Here is the plan: 3.1: National Context; 3.2: Gov. Noah Noble (1832-1837); 3.3: Indiana&#8217;s Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836; 3.4: Governor Wallace (1837-1840) and Indian removal in Indiana; 3.5: Gov. Samuel Bigger (1840-1843); and 3.6: Gov. James Whitcomb (1843-1848), the Mexican American War, and Education in Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>The National Scene</strong></p>
<p>Indiana was not operating in a vacuum, so to set the scene, it’s probably useful to have a bit of national context. On the national level, the Presidents of the United States during this period:<br />
1829 – 1837: Andrew Jackson</p>
<p>1837 &#8211; 1841: Martin Van Buren</p>
<p>1841 &#8211; 1841: William Henry Harrison</p>
<p>1841 &#8211; 1845: John Tyler</p>
<p>1845 &#8211; 1849: James K. Polk</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Andrew &#8220;Old Hickory&#8221; Jackson&#8217;s tenure featured aggressive (aggression seemed to permeate everything Jackson did) Indian removal policies,  and a populist opposition to the National Bank (&#8220;You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, (bringing his fist down on the table) I will rout you out!&#8221;)</p>
<p><em>Martin Van Buren (&#8220;Old Kinderhook&#8221;)</em> (1837 &#8211; 1841) Van Buren&#8217;s tenure had an inauspicious start with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837">Panic of 1837</a>. The Panic was preceded by an economic expansion that had been fueled by a boom in silver, land sales and tariffs, and significant investment from Great Britain related to cotton production, and state backed bonds financing transportation projects (much more on this later on). Rising interest rates from British lenders, a decline in cotton prices, misguided U.S. monetary policy, and land speculation in the west all contributed to a collapse in 1837 which led to an economic decline that lasted for about seven years. Van Buren also declined an initial request by Texas to join the Union. Meanwhile, the Mormons were on the move between Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and ultimately Utah. With respect to slavery, Van Buren was morally opposed but regarded it as sanctioned by the Constitution and, therefore, opposed its abolition in Washington D.C. or in the U.S. generally.</p>
<p><em>William Henry Harrison </em>(1841). Van Buren was blamed for the hard times, opening the way for a Whig Presidency to supplant the Democrats who had held office for quite some time. And, so, running on a campaign of log cabins and hard cider, William Henry (&#8220;Tippecanoe&#8221;) Harrison was elected. He is noted for having the longest inaugural speech and the shortest Presidency. His only official act of consequence was to call Congress into special session because federal funds were in such trouble, the government could not continue to operate until the regular session in December. His candidacy was very helpful to the Whigs in Indiana &#8212; although his political fortunes in the state had diminished as the anti-slavery faction of Jonathan Jennings and the Hoosiers in the eastern part of the state supplanted Harrison and his supporters, the years had mellowed Hoosier memories of Harrison, and he enjoyed a great deal of support borne of nostalgia there.</p>
<p><em>John Tyler</em> (1841-1845) Harrison&#8217;s vice-president, John Tyler (&#8220;His Accidency&#8221;) assumed the Presidency upon Harrison&#8217;s death. It was not necessarily clear from the Constitution that this was the required protocol, but Tyler acted decisively in the transition and the precedent became codified in the 25th amendment. His most notable success was the annexation of Texas which had been declined by Van Buren not long before. Another initiative passed by Congress during Tyler&#8217;s early Presidency was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_Act_of_1841">Preemption Act of 1841</a>. Under its terms, squatters would get a right of first refusal when they had settled on federal lands. When it was offered up for sale, they were entitled to buy up to 160 acres at a discount before the land was offered to the general public. Ohio, Indiana, and other states admitted after them were to be paid 10% of the proceeds of that public land which was to be used for internal improvements. The Premption Act helped fuel the fires of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>, the notion that American settlers were destined to expand throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Tyler&#8217;s administration was plagued by opposition within his own party, partly because his Presidency was inconvenient to the perpetually frustrated Presidential ambitions of Congressional leader, Henry Clay. One division point between Tyler and Congress was the issue of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler#Tariff_and_distribution_debate">Distribution Program</a>. As a result of the lingering economic problems from the Panic of 1837, Tyler thought it necessary to keep tariffs high (John Meynard Keynes and his notions about stimulus spending were not yet a thing) &#8212; High tariffs were contrary to an earlier deal with Southerners where the tariffs were expected to fall and, furthermore, Tyler sought to eliminate distributions from the tariffs to the  states due to the poor condition of federal revenues. Congressional Whigs were unwilling to reduce distributions to the States. After a couple of vetoes that inspired ill-will, Tyler got his way and ended distributions to the states. These fights had roots in Henry Clay&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_(economic_plan)">American System,</a>&#8221; proposed and largely adopted in the 1810s.  It consisted of three primary ideas &#8211; a tariff to protect American industry, a national bank to foster commerce, and federal subsidies for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements">internal improvements</a>. These were generally opposed by the Southerners who wanted to sell cotton abroad, did not have as much in the way of industry, and did not have as great a need for internal improvements as the westerners.</p>
<p><em>James K. Polk</em> (1845-1849). Tyler did not run for election in his own right. Succeeding Tyler was dark-horse candidate, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk">James K. Polk</a> (&#8220;Young Hickory&#8221;) who beat out Van Buren for the Democratic nomination in  1844. He was a remarkably successful expansionist. Mexico opposed U.S. annexation of Texas, so the U.S. went ahead and took most of the southwestern U.S. away from them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War">Mexican-American War</a> in 1846 and 1847. What could have probably been a minor border dispute was turned into a large scale war. Ultimately, Mexico was forced to recognize the annexation of Texas, recognize the Rio Grande as the border, and  obliged to sell parts or all of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California for $15 million and the U.S. agreeing to assume about $3 million of Mexico&#8217;s debt to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Polk also forced a resolution of the British claim to the Oregon Territory &#8212; setting the boundary at the 49th parallel (something less than the &#8220;54-40 or fight&#8221; rhetoric). And, he managed to oversee a reduction of tariffs in a manner that was pleasing to his Southern constituency. &#8220;Additionally, he built an independent treasury system that lasted until 1913&#8242; oversaw the opening of the <a title="United States Naval Academy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Naval_Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a>, the <a title="Smithsonian Institution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, the groundbreaking for the <a title="Washington Monument" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument">Washington Monument</a>, and the issuance of the first United States postage stamp.&#8221; Having accomplished all that, he declined to run for re-election and died of cholera three months later.</p>
<p>Next time: Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll get started with Indiana and Governor Noah Noble (1832-1837).</p>

So, in Parkinson&#8217;s case, &#8220;a committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spent the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike-shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important but also a far more difficult and complex task.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was put in mind of this &#8220;law&#8221; while seeing social media light up about whether Cam Newton was unduly petulant after his Super Bowl loss or whether, instead, he is being unfairly scrutinized due to his race. Or whether the half-time show was ruined a lot or only just a little by Coldplay&#8217;s participation.</p>
<p>You can even see it here where it&#8217;s been a week or more since I posted about a bill even though we&#8217;re in the middle of a legislative session. The trivial is just easier and more entertaining to talk about even though there a lot of important things that concerned citizens ought to be spending their time on.</p>
