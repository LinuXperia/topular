<p>The Michigan Municipal League is a Michigan-based non-profit association made up of towns and cities throughout Michigan. Through advocacy at the state and federal level (including support for the crowdfunding legislation in Michigan), they proactively represent Michigan communities to help them sustain highly livable, desirable, and unique places within the state.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of the Michigan Municipal League is to help build better communities throughout Michigan by promoting an attractive startup and small business environment. They believe that investment crowdfunding can be used to attract, retain, and grow businesses. We couldn&#8217;t agree more!</p>
<p>In support of investment crowdfunding in Michigan and our partnership, the Michigan Municipal League recently launched <a href="http://www.crowdfundingmi.com">crowdfundingmi.com</a>, a website that provides resources, how-to information and links to crowdfunding resources. It serves as a launching pad for potential investors and businesses looking to access resources on crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Michigan Municipal League&#8217;s CrowdfundingMI also has a <a href="https://localstake.com/partners/crowdfundingmi">partner page</a> on the Localstake site, where investors in Michigan will be able to read more about what Localstake has to offer and view and invest in Michigan businesses on Localstake.</p>
<p>We view our partnership with the Michigan Municipal League as the first step in spreading access to and information about investment crowdfunding across Michigan. We believe that <a href="http://www.crowdfundingmi.com">crowdfundingmi.com</a> and the Localstake platform will be incredible assets for Michigan entrepreneurs as they start and grow their businesses!</p>

<p>There were a few gut checks along the way that made it happen.  We think these tips apply to almost any future entrepreneur who is thinking about leaving their job to start their own business.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1)     Buy-in<br />
</strong>Make sure you set expectations up front, especially when you&#8217;re working with a team. The team has to be a seamless, well-oiled machine and everyone MUST be on the same page and at the same level of commitment.  Understand everyone&#8217;s financial motivations and be prepared to live off of savings for a period of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Once we had the idea for Localstake, we spent a substantial amount of time doing market and legal research to help vet the route we would take in the event we pursued the opportunity full time.  The decision came down to the realization that we all believed in the idea and were willing to make the sacrifices necessary to play it out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2)     Concept affirmation<br />
</strong>Make sure you are really on to something before you jump ship.  There are plenty of ways to test different market opportunities on a small scale before changing your life to pursue them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> Right before we had our first founder dive in full-time, we held a presentation about the market problem and opportunity Localstake was looking to pursue.  We invited friends and colleagues, who then invited their friends and colleagues.  Before we knew it, we had 100+ people come out just to hear us talk about our idea.  Not only that, the group was engaged and asking questions to drill into the details of how Localstake would connect local businesses and investors online.  It was an amazing feeling to see our concept, at such an early stage, begin to catch on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3)     Building the right team<br />
</strong>This is a never-ending battle for all businesses, and it is especially important right out of the gates. This isn&#8217;t just the internal team, but also the people and service providers you surround your business with.  A large part of a startup&#8217;s success often depends on bringing the right talent to the table.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We spent a lot of time early on talking to anyone who would listen about our idea.  Those conversations almost always brought insight into another aspect of the business that we hadn&#8217;t considered.  They also connected us to other people, leading us to build out a team of external service providers that support us in different aspects, and filled holes that we weren&#8217;t able to fill internally, yet.</p>
<p>Once we had a dedicated team and an initial group of followers and advocates who had bought into our idea, we moved forward aggressively to make Localstake happen.  It hasn&#8217;t been all smiles and high-fives, and there will definitely be many more speed bumps along the way.  Did we make the right decision jumping ship? Without a doubt.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Value added investing</strong> – Local investors provide value added capital to the businesses they invest in.  In addition to being investors, they can also be advocates and customers.  Local investors can impact the outcome of their investment because they can make introductions to future customers, provide advice, and be a consumer.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>The local economy</strong> – Investing in local businesses also creates real economic value for your community.  Employees are paid with local money, and then those employees spend their wages at other local businesses, creating a cycle of local economic growth.  Since roughly 2/3rds of jobs come from small businesses in this country, local business employment is very important to most communities. Ultimately, investors who invest locally can earn a return on their investment and a return on their community.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Investment in what you know</strong> – One of the first rules of investing is to invest in what you know.  Yet, investors often invest in companies and securities they don’t understand.  When investing in private businesses on Localstake, you will be able to see the company’s business plans, visit their offices/locations, and talk with the management team.  You’ll also probably understand how the company fits in the local economy through your perspective as a consumer. That is difficult to do when investing in publicly traded companies or in companies based in other countries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">Consumers enjoy locally-sourced products and services. This connection with the community can be extended to investing in local businesses. Why not invest some of your portfolio in your favorite growing small business? That’s why we created Localstake.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.localstake.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Localstake-Web-RGB.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-659" alt="Localstake-Web-RGB" src="http://blog.localstake.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Localstake-Web-RGB.png" width="637" height="142" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">The name Localstake can be broken into two distinct, but very important words—“local” and “stake”.</span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #515151;">Local:</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">In regards to investing in private businesses, we believe that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #515151;">Investors should be able to invest in businesses in their community</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #515151;">Not all capital is created equal—local investors offer many advantages vs. traditional capital sources and non-local investors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">Because of our core beliefs, local is much more than a word in our name.  We have built Localstake with a fundamental focus on local businesses, local investors, and local community partners.  The core foundation of the Localstake site is its locally-focused marketplaces.  Live in Arizona?  Great, invest in businesses in the Arizona marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">While Localstake is not a stock exchange, in the past, there were stock exchanges in nearly every major city.  Did you know that all of the following major cities used to (or still do) have stock exchanges: Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Louisville, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, St. Louis, and Washington D.C.</span></p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #515151;">Stake:</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">First and foremost, for all of you that originally thought we sold local cuts of beef, we are sorry to have disappointed you.  On the upside, hopefully you can invest in a local butcher shop in your community instead!  Here at Localstake, we spell stake, s-t-a-k-e and it stands for stakeholder.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">A stakeholder is any person or organization that has an interest, or “stake” in a business.  Stakeholders can include advisors, creditors, customers, employees, government entities, investors, and much, much, more.  Chances are that you are a stakeholder in many local businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">As we were coming up with the idea of Localstake, we knew that we wanted to include all stakeholders of a business on our platform.  We knew that it takes more than just investors to make a local business (and city) successful.  So, that is why we decided to set-up Localstake with three core types of users or stakeholders:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #515151;">Local business</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #515151;">Local investor</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #515151;">Local community partner</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">All of these types of users live in the community and have a STAKE in the success of businesses.  As you join Localstake, think to yourself, what’s your stake?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #515151;">So there you have it, local + stake = Localstake.  As we continue to build and grow Localstake, everything is done with the meaning of Localstake in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #515151;"><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p>We are excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Lemonade Day of Greater Indianapolis. Through the partnership, investors on Localstake will have the opportunity to support youth entrepreneurship and financial literacy.</p>
<p>While we don’t normally work with non-profit organizations to raise funds, we decided to make an exception for the Lemonade Day of Greater Indianapolis.  Brought to Indianapolis by local entrepreneur, Scott Jones, in 2010, Lemonade Day is a unique program that teaches kids how to start, own, and operate their own business: a lemonade stand.  In 2012 alone, 15,000 Indianapolis-area kids participated!</p>
<p>Scott started Lemonade Day in Indianapolis because he noticed that fewer and fewer kids were engaging in entrepreneurial activities like mowing lawns or starting lemonade stands.  And yet many entrepreneurs talk about their early childhood experiences starting lemonade stands, or delivering newspapers, as the moment when the “light bulb went off.”</p>
<p>Now in its fourth year, Lemonade Day is launching a Seed Fund that will be used to provide kid’s the startup funds they need for their lemonade stands.  The goal is to give kids the full entrepreneurial experience, including acquiring their start-up funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.localstake.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lemonade-stand-1.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="lemonade stand 1" src="http://blog.localstake.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lemonade-stand-1.png" width="620" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>As entrepreneurs ourselves, when we first heard about the Lemonade Day Seed Fund, we instantly knew we had to get involved.  We love its mission of teaching kids about entrepreneurship, financial literacy, philanthropy, and much more.  So, we decided to help Lemonade Day raise the $10,000 it needs to fund its Seed Fund!</p>
<p>So, if you had a lemonade stand, paper route, or lawn mowing business as a child, or just want to help ensure that more kids learn about entrepreneurship, below are the details of how you can donate to the Lemonade Day Seed Fund on Localstake:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. <a href="https://localstake.com/lemonade_day">Go to the Lemonade Day Seed Fund Profile</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Review the fundraising profile and pitch</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Press &#8220;Donate&#8221;</p>
<p>Donations can be made securely over the Localstake platform by credit card.  Plus, if you donate more than $25 to the Seed Fund, you will receive a VIP invitation to the Lemonade Day Results Celebration Event where Lemonade Day will release the results of the 2013 Lemonade Day event and feature some of the kids who participated!</p>
<p>If you have kids or know kids ages 3 to 16, encourage them to sign up for Lemonade Day 2013.  Lemonade Day 2013 will be held on Saturday, May 18th.  More information on registering can be found at the <a href="http://indianapolis.lemonadeday.org/" target="_blank">Lemonade Day of Indianapolis website</a>.</p>
<p>Lemonade Day of Greater Indianapolis is operated by the Think Forward Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization.  Donations are tax-deductible.  All donations will be facilitated through Localstake LLC.</p>

<p>After we receive an application from a company to raise capital, we have a conversation with the company owner(s) to see if it is an opportunity we should pursue further. This initial conversation eliminates many of the companies that are not ready to raise capital and those that we feel would not be a good fit for Localstake.  Companies that pass through this initial conversation then submit to a full due diligence review, which includes, but is not limited to, a/an:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-depth review of the company’s business plan</li>
<li>Background checks on the management team and significant shareholders</li>
<li>Corporate credit check on the company</li>
<li>Site or facility visit/validation</li>
<li>Competitor analysis</li>
<li>Industry analysis</li>
<li>Review of the current and proposed management team</li>
<li>Existing debt and liabilities</li>
<li>Intended use of funds</li>
<li>Capital structure including any outstanding securities</li>
<li>Evaluation of any current or pending litigation</li>
<li>Review of corporate organization documents</li>
<li>Discussion with customers and suppliers</li>
<li>Viability review of any patents or other intellectual property held by the issuer</li>
<li>Analysis of financials
<ul>
<li>Historical financial statements</li>
<li>Assets held by the company</li>
<li>Projected financial statements</li>
<li>Burn rate</li>
<li>Break-even</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, when performing due diligence, we perform our own independent research to verify company representations and claims. Only when we have received all of this information and the business has answered all of our follow up questions, will we move forward toward preparing an offering with the business. Once the offering is live on the Localstake Marketplace, it is the investor’s turn to perform their own research and due diligence, and see if the opportunity is a fit for their investment portfolio.</p>
<p>As a business looking to raise capital, it is not a guarantee, nor is it easy, to raise capital on Localstake. Localstake is not a classifieds website, social network, or matching website.  If a company does not pass the due diligence review or does not provide us the information we need or request, they will not be granted the opportunity to raise capital on Localstake.  We are required by law to perform due diligence on all of the offerings listed on the platform, and we want our investors to know that they are only looking at legitimate investment opportunities.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with loans, even if they have never invested in one.  When you lend a company money, you expect them to pay you back your original investment, plus interest.  This is exactly how a loan investment works on Localstake.  For example, in exchange for lending a company $100,000, a company may promise to pay investors their original investments back over the next five years, plus 10% in interest each year.  Be reminded, just because a company promises to pay you back your original investment and interest, there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so in the future.  One last point to note, while loans can get very complex if covenants and guarantees are added, most loans on Localstake are more straightforward and do not require these items.</p>
<p>The second main type of investment that will be available on Localstake is called revenue share. Revenue share investments are less familiar to many people, but the concept is easy to understand.  In exchange for your investment, the company will pay you a percentage of its revenues until you reach a pre-determined payback amount.  For example, in exchange for raising $100,000 from investors, a company may pay investors 5% of its revenues until they have paid back 1.5x the original amount invested, or $150,000.  So, every month until the maximum payback is reached, investors will receive 5% of the business’s revenues.</p>
<p>The third main type of investment that will be available on Localstake will be equity. When you are investing in the equity of a business, you are becoming an owner in the business.  The amount you invest will determine how much ownership you have in that business.  Unlike a loan or revenue share investment, equity investments do not have set terms or maturities for paying back investors.  Rather, a few of the potential ways investors can receive their money back (plus hopefully a profit) when investing in the equity of a business are: from a merger or acquisition, initial public offering, through dividends, or if the company buys your shares back.  However, since none of these are guaranteed, when investing in equity of a business, investors need to be prepared to hold onto equity investments for the long term and may lose their entire investment.</p>
<p>Most of the early investment types you will see on Localstake will be a loan, a revenue share, or a combination loan and revenue share investment.  The typical company that is able to offer investors a loan or revenue share investment is one that already has revenues and has been in businesses for a few years.</p>
<p>Instead of offering one type of investment, we wanted to provide investors the ability to create their own diversified portfolio of private business investments&#8211;one that is built for their own personal risk tolerance and preferences.

This means that our mission to bring local investment opportunities to everyday investors is finally being achieved. Looking back over the past two years, we have accomplished a tremendous amount&#8211;leaving our jobs in investment management and investment banking, raising two rounds of capital, and getting approved as a broker dealer.</p>
<p>Localstake gives everyday investors the ability to invest in local businesses. If you are interested in investing on Localstake, you can <a href="http://www.localstake.com/sign_up">sign up</a> as an investor to complete your investment account.</p>
<p>Additionally, local businesses now have access to a new form of capital and the opportunity to raise capital in a more efficient way. If you are a business that needs funding, <a href="https://localstake.com/users/sign_up">sign up</a> as a business and submit your application to raise capital.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will be blogging on everything from investing insights to tips on how to raise capital. Stay tuned as we begin a new chapter of Localstake and please <a href="http://www.localstake.com/contact_us">contact us </a>with questions or feedback.</p>
