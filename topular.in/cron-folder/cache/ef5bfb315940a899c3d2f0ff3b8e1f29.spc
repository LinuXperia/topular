Dear Bill Murray,

This might sound kind of straight forward, but will you be my best friend?

Hear me out, I'm sure you get a ton of people asking you that question several times a day, but just ignore them. You see, we're both from the suburbs of Chicago so I think that's reason enough. No?

Well, I'm a huge fan of your movies and I can recite so many of your lines. So, so many!

We could watch a movie like, <em>Ghostbusters</em> or <em>Tootsie</em> or <em>Rushmore</em> and I'll say what you're going to say even before you say it. Wouldn't that be cool?

I still haven't sold you yet? Well, I also like to quote your characters at random times during the day.

I can't stop saying, "How interesting. How bizarre," from one of my favorite movies, <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>. I can't even hear <em>Star Wars</em> without singing it in a lounge singer's voice. "Star Wars, nothing but Star Wars."

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/10/tootsie.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4497" alt="tootsie" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/10/tootsie.gif" width="348" height="216" /></a>

Even though I join half the world population in loving your movies, you just seem like a cool guy. I'm always reading about your showing up at random birthday parties, crashing engagement photos and singing karaoke.

So, I just want to throw it out there. If you're ever back in your hometown and you're looking for a new best friend, I'm your gal.

I saw something online about dog walking and I thought it would be perfect. I was already zipping around the neighborhood with our dog and a stroller twice a day. How hard could it be?

I submitted my information and was contacted by the two owners of the dog walking business. Let us call them, Matt and Kim.

We met up at a sandwich shop where we chatted for a bit. Matt told me he thought I'd be a great addition to their dog walking team. I would only have to attend two onsite interview/training sessions. No problem, Matt!

Later that week, they set me up to meet with Caitlin, a dog walker who was also a school social worker. Everything went as planned. Went to two houses, walked some dogs, all was right in the dog walking world.

We were saying goodbye when Caitlin gave  me a warning. "Just so you know, Kim can be really tough. Try not to let her scare you away." Foreboding. Almost, Shakespearean.

The next day I met up with Kim at a gigantic house in an affluent suburb. Real artwork, a pool, a tennis court and a Shih Tzu we'll call Buffy Buffington III.

Kim sighed as I "freshened up" Buffy's bowl with (gasp!) tap water. Was I supposed to use Evian? Tell me what the rich people do, Kim!

After a walk outside that involved me rambling on to fill the awkward silence, Kim frowned, watching me intently as I picked up after Buffy Buffington III and tied poop up into a little bag. It was amazing. And by amazing, I mean borderline psychotic.

Next up, another suburb with an even fancier house. I'm not sure how I was even allowed in the neighborhood, but I found myself walking into the huge front doors with my new happy gal pal, Kim.

I first noticed the two dogs were baby gated into a laundry room. Then came the overwhelming smell of dog pee.

Oh, yes. A St. Bernard and a French Bulldog hippity hopping in what I can only assume was 20 gallons of pee. Kim's permanent frown defied gravity, and deepened even more. "Cleaning supplies are over there," she said, pointing to a closet and walking away.

After an hour of dutifully mopping the floor, cleaning up the dogs and doling out doggie medication, it was time for us to make an exit. On the way out to our cars, Kim gave me the lowdown.

"I'm not confident that you're ready to join our team. Maybe you can come back for another session and I'll see how you do then."

I really hoped Kim would give me a second chance.

Ah, who am I kidding. I got into my car, peeled out of the fancy neighborhood (there were cobblestone streets so it was kind of hard) and never looked back.

Can you top that? Let's hear your worst interview story!

Are all of these beaming pictures of children I see on Facebook real? Do your children do things like, smile when you say, "Smile?"

Last week Franky came bounding off the bus and I asked him how picture day went.

"Oh, I didn't smile! The guy said pretty please a bunch of times. I just went like this." (Makes intensely serious face.)

I had told him the day before that if he didn't smile in his picture, he would have to stay in kindergarten an extra year. He called my bluff.

Franky has decided he doesn't like to smile in pictures. He also says he's going to "destroy the earth" and he tells people he's an evil genius.

He is now attending the same school as Lilia. Their P.E. teacher told her that Franky is great, but she questioned his evil genius claims.

Picking up Franky at summer camp, I was surrounded by camp friends asking me if he really is an evil genius. The other day, he jumped off a huge rock while yelling, "Victory is mine!" before running down the sidewalk laughing maniacally.

Turns out, evil geniuses don't smile in pictures.

His sister is no help. In fact, she has timed it so that she'll be smiling perfectly for a picture and as soon as the camera goes off, it's crazy face time.

Because of these antics, I like to give out many helpful suggestions while I take their pictures.

"Make a serious face. I mean, a smiling, but serious face. You, over there, stand still for ONE second. I'm not kidding. Can you at least pretend to be happy? Do you ever want to be able to play a video game again in your life? We should probably take a good picture now because we're NEVER COMING BACK!"

Maybe they realize we're not sitting for 19th century portraits and that I can take a million digital photos. Maybe they're just letting their quirky personalities show through.

Or, maybe Franky really is an evil genius that is out to destroy family photography. Only time will tell.

Last week Franky came bounding off the bus and I asked him how picture day went.

"Oh, I didn't smile! The guy said pretty please a bunch of times. I just went like this." (Makes intensely serious face.)

I had told him the day before that if he didn't smile in his picture, he would have to stay in kindergarten an extra year. He called my bluff.

Franky has decided he doesn't like to smile in pictures. He also says he's going to "destroy the earth" and he tells people he's an evil genius.

He is now attending the same school as Lilia. Their P.E. teacher told her that Franky is great, but she questioned his evil genius claims.

It really is one of the simplest desserts you can make and many of you probably already have the ingredients at home.

Here's how you do it:

<strong>Ingredients:</strong>

<strong>1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)</strong>

<strong>2 tbsp coconut oil</strong>

<strong>2 tbsp maple syrup or honey (non-vegan option)</strong>

<strong>1/4 tsp vanilla extract </strong>

1. Add peanut butter to a medium sized bowl.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0001.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4422" alt="1-DSC_0001" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0001.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a>

2. Add coconut oil.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0003.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4435" alt="1-DSC_0003" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0003.jpg" width="800" height="646" /></a>

3. Add honey or maple syrup. (I used maple syrup.)

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/3-DSC_0005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4424" alt="3-DSC_0005" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/3-DSC_0005.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a>

4. Add vanilla extract.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4429" alt="1-DSC_0010" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0010.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a>

5. Mix ingredients well.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/4-DSC_0015.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4425" alt="4-DSC_0015" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/4-DSC_0015.jpg" width="800" height="696" /></a>

6. Line a container with parchment paper or plastic wrap and pour in the mixture. I used a bread pan and parchment paper, but really any medium sized container will work.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/5-DSC_0019.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4426" alt="5-DSC_0019" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/5-DSC_0019.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a>

7. Pop into the freezer and let it set for about 45 minutes to an hour. When ready, remove from the liner, and cut into pieces. This makes about eight servings.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0023.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4436" alt="1-DSC_0023" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0023.jpg" width="800" height="485" /></a>

This fudge will get all gooey if left out, so it's best served cold, right out of the freezer.

Enjoy!

Makeup websites/tutorials</strong>. Have you ever browsed a website and one click led to another and you realized you just lost a good portion of your life? Some people find this happens on Pinterest, Reddit (guilty) or YouTube.

I can scroll through websites dedicated to makeup advice like it's my job. Makeup for days!

Face contouring. I own one bottle of drugstore foundation and <a href="http://www.elle.com/beauty/news/a28308/how-to-contour-pro/">I'm looking up face contouring</a>? Am I going to invest in $100 worth of makeup to  paint my face with ten different creams so I can look fancy when I bring my kids to swim lessons? Is the paparazzi hanging out in the Target parking lot waiting for me?

Drinking coffee, clicking through a slideshow of  nude lipsticks, knowing full well I probably wear lipstick once every other month. Makes sense.

<strong>2. Portillo's chocolate milkshakes.</strong> I've had a million milkshakes, but these are the best.

I'm not sure what they put in them. Ice cream, chocolate sauce and crack? Possibly, but I don't care because they are that fantastic. You might see a large Portillo's shake, which is the size of a toddler, and think you can't possibly drink it all, but you can. Oh yes, you can.

<strong>3. 80's movies.</strong> I think I'm in good company here when I say 80's movies are like car accidents. If they're on TV, you can't look away.

As far as music goes, the 90's was my time to shine. However, the 80's have the lock on all the movies I will watch on repeat.

In that past two weeks I watched, from beginning to end, <em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Poltergeist</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em>. (Thank you, DVR.)

I mean, how can you beat a scene like this? What's going to happen to Marty? Will George come through? The suspense!

<strong>4. A Paloma.</strong> I love my sister-in-law Melissa for many reasons, but I'm pretty sure her introducing me to the paloma is number one. If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.

A couple of years ago she told me she was going to mix me a drink that involved Diet Squirt, lime and tequila. I said, "Uh, no thanks."

Thanks to her perseverance I did end up drinking this glorious concoction and I fell in love.

For all of you people that are all, "No way. I can't drink tequila. Maybe in a margarita, but that's it." Hear me out. The paloma is better <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0009.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4412" alt="1-DSC_0009" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0009-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>than a margarita. I would not lie to you, my friends.

You'll find different recipes, but a true paloma will involve grapefruit soda (or club soda with fresh grapefruit juice), tequila and a lime wedge. Here's how you do it.

1. Fill a tall glass with ice.

2. Pour in a shot of tequila.

3. Pour in the Squirt (I prefer the taste of diet. You do you.)

4. Squeeze some lime in or just toss a slice in there. (I often drink these without the lime as well.)

You're welcome.

<strong>5. Dateline NBC Murder Mysteries.</strong> Christine, what did you do on Friday? Oh, I just watched this new documentary on the use of pesticides and, uh, you know stuff like that.

Nope. I watched<em> Dateline</em> and I loved it. I've seen every episode and I also talk to the TV. "Seriously Bob, you Googled how to make murder look like an accident? Real smart, genius."

The other weekend Fran was going out with friends and I discovered a new <em>Dateline</em> had been taped and it was two hours long. Two hours! The excitement! Fran said something as he was leaving about texting me or trains or something. I held my paloma close and I could see his lips moving, but all I could hear was Keith Morrison talking.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/keith-morrison.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4411" alt="keith morrison" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/keith-morrison.gif" width="496" height="280" /></a>

Now it's your turn. What are your guilty pleasures? Keith and I would love to know.

Is the paparazzi hanging out in the Target parking lot waiting for me?

Drinking coffee, clicking through a slideshow of  nude lipsticks, knowing full well I probably wear lipstick once every other month. Makes sense.

<strong>2. Portillo's chocolate milkshakes.</strong> I've had a million milkshakes, but these are the best.

I'm not sure what they put in them. Ice cream, chocolate sauce and crack? Possibly, but I don't care because they are that fantastic. You might see a large Portillo's shake, which is the size of a toddler, and think you can't possibly drink it all, but you can. Oh yes, you can.

<strong>3. 80's movies.</strong> I think I'm in good company here when I say 80's movies are like car accidents. If they're on TV, you can't look away.

As far as music goes, the 90's was my time to shine. However, the 80's have the lock on all the movies I will watch on repeat.

In that past two weeks I watched, from beginning to end, <em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Poltergeist</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em>. (Thank you, DVR.)

I mean, how can you beat a scene like this? What's going to happen to Marty? Will George come through? The suspense!

<strong>4. A Paloma.</strong> I love my sister-in-law Melissa for many reasons, but I'm pretty sure her introducing me to the paloma is number one. If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.

A couple of years ago she told me she was going to mix me a drink that involved Diet Squirt, lime and tequila. I said, "Uh, no thanks."

Thanks to her perseverance I did end up drinking this glorious concoction and I fell in love.

For all of you people that are all, "No way. I can't drink tequila. Maybe in a margarita, but that's it." Hear me out. The paloma is better <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0009.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4412" alt="1-DSC_0009" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/1-DSC_0009-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>than a margarita. I would not lie to you, my friends.

You'll find different recipes, but a true paloma will involve grapefruit soda (or club soda with fresh grapefruit juice), tequila and a lime wedge. Here's how you do it.

1. Fill a tall glass with ice.

2. Pour in a shot of tequila.

3. Pour in the Squirt (I prefer the taste of diet. You do you.)

4. Squeeze some lime in or just toss a slice in there. (I often drink these without the lime as well.)

You're welcome.

<strong>5. Dateline NBC Murder Mysteries.</strong> Christine, what did you do on Friday? Oh, I just watched this new documentary on the use of pesticides and, uh, you know stuff like that.

Nope. I watched<em> Dateline</em> and I loved it. I've seen every episode and I also talk to the TV. "Seriously Bob, you Googled how to make murder look like an accident? Real smart, genius."

The other weekend Fran was going out with friends and I discovered a new <em>Dateline</em> had been taped and it was two hours long. Two hours! The excitement! Fran said something as he was leaving about texting me or trains or something. I held my paloma close and I could see his lips moving, but all I could hear was Keith Morrison talking.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/keith-morrison.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4411" alt="keith morrison" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/09/keith-morrison.gif" width="496" height="280" /></a>

Now it's your turn. What are your guilty pleasures? Keith and I would love to know.

Well, things got real today with my kids and homework and all of that fun parenting stuff.

So, I leave you with these two camels riding around Arkansas.

I've been on a lot of road trips, but I would say that two camels looking at me while I was driving through the middle of Arkansas earlier this year (my first trip through that state, by the way) was pretty interesting to say the least.

It was cold, but the camels seem kind of happy. Are they smiling at me because I was smiling at them? Are they keeping some kind of camel secret? We shall never know.

So, can you top that? What's the craziest thing you've seen on a road trip? Inquiring minds want to know.

I've decided I'm going to get back on the horse and start blogging again. Why? Because I love writing this blog and interacting with my readers is just plain fun and awesome. I'm very eloquent as you can see, but it's true.

I'm revamping my blog so it's not going to be about doing something new every day or really following any sort of theme. It will still be me and I'll be writing about all sorts of topics.

I have a lot of ideas running through my head at all times. Sometimes I jot down little notes about stuff I want to write about. Then I forget and I find a piece of scrap paper that says "zombie apocalypse food" or "my house smells." You know, things that that the public finds interesting and demands to know more about.

I also enjoy an inner monologue that causes me to laugh out loud, seemingly at the wall. Am I normal? Are you guys the same way? Do you also question food options during the zombie apocalypse?

Let me know as you join me on this new path of writing that I've never tried before. Writing about nothing, something and everything in between.

Also...new post later today!

Hope to see you there,

Christine

Schools have been closing down and parents have been looking for things to do on a snow day to keep everyone from losing their marbles.

Luckily, we survived the Polar Vortex last year and I lived to share some of our favorite activities with you so this winter will be a breeze. Sorry, I shouldn't say breeze. This winter will be like a nice, warm fire. Okay, here you go:

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/1-DSC_0001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4372" alt="1-DSC_0001" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/1-DSC_0001-300x273.jpg" width="300" height="273" /></a>

1. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2013/12/healthy-dark-chocolate-hot-cocoa-recipe/">Make dark chocolate hot cocoa</a>

This dark chocolate hot cocoa is so easy to make and loved by kids and adults.

2. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/01/when-its-cold-outside-bring-the-snow-indoors/#image/1">Bring the snow indoors</a>

What happens when you have a ton of snow, but it's too cold to play outside? It was -8°F the other evening and my kids asked if they could go outside to build a snowman. This isn't <em>Frozen</em>, guys. Your fingers might just fall off. Inside though? No problem.

3. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/01/polar-vortex-or-not-were-going-sledding/">Go sledding</a> or <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/02/5-places-to-try-cross-country-skiing-in-chicagoland/">cross country skiing </a>

What happens when you have a snow day and it's actually not bitterly cold? Sledding is pretty much for any age. You can just pop your kid on your lap and head downhill.

Cross country skiing is also a lot of fun and great exercise. Skiing and running up sled hills warms you right up. Plus, it's a great way to wear your kids out. Let's face it, isn't that the goal of every parent?

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/2-DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4373" alt="2-DSC_0010" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/2-DSC_0010-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

4. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/01/embrace-the-cold-and-make-maple-taffy-snow/">Make maple taffy snow</a>

I had never even heard of maple taffy snow until last year, but apparently it's an honored tradition in many cold climate areas. I can see why. It's delicious and it's just plain fun to make.

&nbsp;

5. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2013/11/how-to-make-fantastically-frozen-bubbles/">Blow frozen bubbles</a><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/3-DSC_0011.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4374" alt="3-DSC_0011" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/3-DSC_0011-277x300.jpg" width="277" height="300" /></a>

We've done frozen bubbles when it's 20ºF, but the colder the temperature, the better. They'll freeze much faster and you can impress the kids with your wizardry.

Have fun!

Luckily, we survived the Polar Vortex last year and I lived to share some of our favorite activities with you so this winter will be a breeze. Sorry, I shouldn't say breeze. This winter will be like a nice, warm fire. Okay, here you go:

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/1-DSC_0001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4372" alt="1-DSC_0001" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/1-DSC_0001-300x273.jpg" width="300" height="273" /></a>

1. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2013/12/healthy-dark-chocolate-hot-cocoa-recipe/">Make dark chocolate hot cocoa</a>

This dark chocolate hot cocoa is so easy to make and loved by kids and adults.

2. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/01/when-its-cold-outside-bring-the-snow-indoors/#image/1">Bring the snow indoors</a>

What happens when you have a ton of snow, but it's too cold to play outside? It was -8°F the other evening and my kids asked if they could go outside to build a snowman. This isn't <em>Frozen</em>, guys. Your fingers might just fall off. Inside though? No problem.

3. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/01/polar-vortex-or-not-were-going-sledding/">Go sledding</a> or <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/02/5-places-to-try-cross-country-skiing-in-chicagoland/">cross country skiing </a>

What happens when you have a snow day and it's actually not bitterly cold? Sledding is pretty much for any age. You can just pop your kid on your lap and head downhill.

Cross country skiing is also a lot of fun and great exercise. Skiing and running up sled hills warms you right up. Plus, it's a great way to wear your kids out. Let's face it, isn't that the goal of every parent?

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/2-DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4373" alt="2-DSC_0010" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/2-DSC_0010-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

4. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2014/01/embrace-the-cold-and-make-maple-taffy-snow/">Make maple taffy snow</a>

I had never even heard of maple taffy snow until last year, but apparently it's an honored tradition in many cold climate areas. I can see why. It's delicious and it's just plain fun to make.

&nbsp;

5. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/2013/11/how-to-make-fantastically-frozen-bubbles/">Blow frozen bubbles</a><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/3-DSC_0011.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4374" alt="3-DSC_0011" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2015/01/3-DSC_0011-277x300.jpg" width="277" height="300" /></a>

We've done frozen bubbles when it's 20ºF, but the colder the temperature, the better. They'll freeze much faster and you can impress the kids with your wizardry.

Have fun!

As in, they think that Target made up the song for their holiday ads.

Couple that with the fact that I've been playing Darlene Love's version of "Marshmallow World" and <em>A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector</em> on repeat like I do every Christmas season, I knew is was time to share my favorite Christmas album.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ubsb2bh0kz8" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

It's true, Phil Spector took a one way trip to crazy town, to say the least. Still, if you like Christmas music and you're not listening to this album, you're missing out on some sweet "wall of sound" yuletide jams. (Consider that description trademarked.)

My mom had <em>A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector</em> playing around the clock when I was little. I still remember '80s Christine playing in the snow singing "Marshmallow World."<em> </em>Now my kids dance around the kitchen to the same song.

We actually dance around to every song on this album. You just can't help it. Even if you're not that into Christmas music I guarantee you'll sneak in a wiggle.

I always wished I had a powerful singing voice just like Darlene Love. Well, guess what, friends? When I play this song, I sing it as loud as I can and I sound just like her. (A little imagination and a glass of wine go a long way.)

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UV8x7H3DD8Y" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Several months ago, Lilia found out that, ahem, Santa lives closer than she previously thought. It started with her sitting me at a table, holding a light over my face and shooting off questions about the tooth fairy. It all went downhill from there.

I noticed that ever since that debacle, she has been in love with "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus." I haven't asked her why, but I think it's because she feels like she's finally in on it. I also think she gets a kick out of her parents kissing under the Christmas tree even though she'll deny it.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ilLT-ge6Luo" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

So many more great songs, but I'll leave you with this one.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/iZDgz5UuT68" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Now here's where I'll throw you for a loop. <em>A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector</em> is my favorite Christmas album, but it doesn't actually contain my all time favorite Christmas song.

That title goes to "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" from <em>A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra</em>. (A close runner up for my favorite Christmas album. If I could only have two, these would be it.)

Once you're settled down from dancing to the previous songs, it's time to relax by a Christmas tree/fireplace/Christmas lights/window and listen to <em>Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</em>.

My first concert.

The place: Rosemont Horizon. The band: New Kids on the Block.

I wore a pink and white New Kids on the Block sweatshirt. I was in a stadium with one million other girls screaming and sweating and trying to see one speck on the stage which happened to be Joe McIntyre, my favorite New Kid. If I squinted my eyes just right, I could almost make out the guy who adorned the poster hanging on my bedroom wall.

I loved that concert and afterward I was hooked. On concerts, that is.

I was over New Kids on the Block the following year when I started junior high and moved on to Nirvana. How does one go from New Kids to Nirvana? I don't know, but it happens. I traded my Keds for Converse and flannel and the rest is history.

I remember seeing "old hippies" at concerts when I was 15 years old (they were probably only 40 years old) and I thought, "That's going to be me! I'm never going to stop rocking!"

Now that I'm an old hippie, or suburban mom squeezing into Target skinny jeans, I stand by my statement. Kind of.

Years ago the husband and I came to the conclusion that we weren't doing general admission concerts anymore. Lawns seats where I can actually sit? Check. A ticket that goes along with a specific chair in which I can place my rear? Check. Standing for hours on end crammed in front of the stage? Nope.

Wouldn't you know, along came a concert that we really wanted to see and guess what? It was general admission.

Maybe we'll make an exception this once. We can do this, right? We're not <em>that</em> old.

Right.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2014/12/old-simpson.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4339" alt="old simpson" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2014/12/old-simpson.jpg" width="500" height="372" /></a>

<strong>Then:</strong> General admission is the best! We can push our way up to the front and if we're lucky the lead singer will sweat on us!

<strong>Now:</strong> When is this show going to start already? My legs are already starting to feel it. (Stretches back)

<strong>Then:</strong> This is awesome! There's a ton of people here. Let's push up further!

<strong>Now:</strong> Scanning the venue for the nearest exits, "I read this place was built in the '20s. I love the architecture."

<strong>Then:</strong> Body surfing! Moshing!

<strong>Now:</strong> Don't even think about surfing your body over here. Mama has a bad back and I'm not shelling out for physical therapy again. Send that dude/girl back over to those 18 year olds. They look so spry!

<strong>Then:</strong> (Lead singer jumps into the crowd) Yeah! Best night of my life!

<strong>Now:</strong> Oh man, you rock and I love your music, but don't kick me. (Starts to move to the back of the crowd)

<strong>Then:</strong> Lighters go up in the air.

<strong>Now:</strong> A sea of smartphones record every second. No fist pumping as it will mess up the shot.

<strong>Then:</strong> I wore my old shoes because they already have beer all over them.

<strong>Now:</strong> I wore my old shoes because I know about ten different fools are going to spill beer all over them.

<strong>Then:</strong> I'm so sweaty that I run and put my entire head under a sink at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aragonchicago">Aragon Ballroom</a>.

<strong>Now:</strong> It's so hot in here. Maybe I can get some cold water and find a window.

<strong>Then:</strong> Which party/bar/friend's house are we going to after the concert?

<strong>Now:</strong> Seriously we have to get home. If I fall asleep right now how many hours of sleep will I get before the kids wake up?

<strong>Then:</strong> More beer!

<strong>Now:</strong> More ibuprofen!

Matt Shultz, the lead singer of Cage the Elephant<em>, </em>is a rock star and he will also jump off a speaker and land on your head. You've been warned.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2014/12/stage-dive-o.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4338" alt="stage-dive-o" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/new-abides/files/2014/12/stage-dive-o.gif" width="320" height="240" /></a>

I still love concerts and truth be told, I do stand up and dance and sing most of the time. Last summer I stood in a mud pit in the pouring rain so I could dance and sing horribly to Tom Petty. He can't sing <em>American Girl</em> by himself, you know.

I'll still drink a big 'ole plastic cup of cheap beer anytime, but it's going to taste a whole lot better if I have a place to sit. You know, just in case.

<strong>Then:</strong> Which party/bar/friend's house are we going to after the concert?

<strong>Now:</strong> Seriously we have to get home. If I fall asleep right now how many hours of sleep will I get before the kids wake up?

<strong>Then:</strong> More beer!

<strong>Now:</strong> More ibuprofen!

Matt Shultz, the lead singer of Cage the Elephant<em>, </em>is a rock star and he will also jump off a speaker and land on your head. You've been warned.

I still love concerts and truth be told, I do stand up and dance and sing most of the time. Last summer I stood in a mud pit in the pouring rain so I could dance and sing horribly to Tom Petty. He can't sing <em>American Girl</em> by himself, you know.

I'll still drink a big 'ole plastic cup of cheap beer anytime, but it's going to taste a whole lot better if I have a place to sit. You know, just in case.
