Seriously, because I’ve owned nine cars and I didn’t like all of them, just because a car is a deal or even really practical, doesn’t mean you will like it.

I’m not saying buy a car you can’t afford just because you really like it, but try not to compromise too much, you’re going to spend a lot of time in this car.

Second, test drives are not enough to see if you really like a car.  Even dealerships with “test tracks”, that’s not every day driving and living.

Yes always test drive a car to make sure there are no obvious issues (especially a used car), but every time I test drove I car, I felt pressure and was more concerned not to crash it.

My advice to really try a car out is to rent one if possible. And rent it for several days, take the car to work, go to the store, pick up your kids, do regular stuff and really see if it works for you.

Or what I’ve done is ask a good friend or relative to drive or borrow their car if they have a car you like. Your comfort level will be better, you can have more time with it (than a test drive), and they can give you all kinds of insight on the car.

Now the big thing is to do your homework on the car, know the options, and check out any websites (especially owner forums), reviews and prices. That way you know what you want and when a dealer tries to railroad you into a car (and they might), you know what that model is.

I spent a short time last summer as a new car salesman, despite my love &amp; knowledge of cars, selling new cars is not for me but I learned a lot.

Buying a car is a numbers game, salesmen will ask you about monthly payment but know what a car costs and know your credit and what your budget is.

Most new cars don’t pay sales guys a lot (i.e. mini deals), unless there’s an incentive, the money is in warranties and used cars.

The car should come with some kind of basic warranty and you should buy an extended warranty if the car is newer (say within 3-4 years), other than that unless you plan to keep this car forever think hard about any other warranty they offer you.

Some dealers offer paint protection, interior protection, pre-paid service work and other upgrades, especially on trucks and SUV’s. Like I said, if you will keep this car a long time, maybe but also realize this will raise your monthly payment.

Speaking of monthly payment, you are going to have to make that payment for a while, some dealers have financing for new car loans for over 6-7 years.

Think about that, the car may not be worth anything close to the loan by then (it’s called being “upside down”), and trading the car in at that point causes “negative equity”.
Which means the next car’s loan will reflect that money left over from the first car, hence a bigger note. Unless you have a large down payment.

Biggest thing in the car business is the proverbial “Cash is King”, the more you put down or can pay it all in cash gives you power. Negotiating power, choosing power &amp; power over your loan if you choose to take one.

If you come to dealership with a low down payment (under 10%), with an upside down trade in you are at the mercy of the salesman and they may simply pick a car out for you and then your choice of financing is limited.

If you come in and can put more than 25% down or more, you can choose your car, more banks will want to finance you (at better rates), and your overall deal will be better.

I have no secrets to negotiating a deal, car salesman usually sell cars five days a week (9 or 12 hour shifts), and they know the cars, options packages and what you qualify for.

If you know all of that and have cash, the playing field is almost level. Virtually every car deal has to be approved by a sales manager and then goes to financing, you have to go with what’s available on that. But feel free to leave if you haven’t signed anything.

Now there are car buying services like True Car or Consumer Reports that tell you what people are paying and get you in the door. What dealers do to work around that is get you to buy more car, meaning options so be aware.
That’s for new cars in used cars you are on your own, so know your prices, what a car is worth and what you are willing to pay.

Most dealers have “internet managers” who handle emails of people who ask about prices and want quotes. Their job is to get you in the dealership with a “good price” so be aware of that too.

Also for used cars, call ahead to the dealership to make sure the car you want is still here and then make an appointment to see it that day, you don’t want to get caught in “bait &amp; switch”.

They may ask you if you can pay $ 500 a month and you say sure but if the car is $ 22,000 and you have good credit and a decent down payment, that’s a bad deal.

Know the interest rates, get pre-approved if you can through your bank or credit union but be careful handing that check to the dealer.

In some cases the dealer will want to “prequalify you” meaning run your credit (and too many credit inquiries hurts your score), and have you do a finance application, possibly even prior to a test drive. They want to see what kind of car to put you in.

You should be able to test drive without going that far, just have your driver’s license and proof of insurance.

Also you may have your heart set on one car and the salesmen will want you to try something else, this is when having cash counts. If you really want a Chevrolet Cruze and they want you to look a Chevrolet Malibu (which costs more), then walk out.

Lastly there are used car options such as buying a rent a car or one of the used car superstores that have “fixed pricing”, meaning the price on the sticker is what you pay. It’s more cut and dry and price might be slighter higher but a less intimidating atmosphere, check them out too.

Remember this will be your car, your payment and your credit, so own it and get the best you can get.

You may have heard people used that term to call their children and think its “ghetto” or “demeaning” but let me tell you, its truth.

The other day my son is sitting on the floor in the living room and he reaches down and faster than you can spell “the” he reaches in the rug and perfectly picks up a crumb like Frank Thomas used to scoop up a baseball. Hence he has lived up to the name.

He’s in the grabbing state, so anything within reach is game, even its its out of reach, its still game.

He’s going for it, a cup, remote, toy and yes crumbs.

His reactions are jack rabbit fast and his strength is amazing. You’ve heard about “old man strength”, where some old cat you think is way past his prime ‘still has it”. Yeah ask any teenage boy whose old man knocked him out.
Well these little kids got that “baby power”. My son can use his whole body strength to get what he wants (its like “The Force”, daycare style), so one little short arm “stiff arms” you to hold you back while the free arm grabs that crumb.

Try prying that crumb out of his hand, good luck, you’re more likely to get a pulverized saltine than anything else.

Then he sits and laughs at you.

And you’re pissed but can’t stay mad at him. You don’t want him to see you crack and smile so you bite your lip and mumble something to him.

He’s still laughing.

You know I thought I was smart, I write this blog (and another blog at Linked In), and I graduated from both Brother Rice &amp; DePaul University. I’ve worked for United Airlines and done corporate work since 2000, I’ve done a lot in my 40 years.

It don’t mean jack to that little boy.

He’s figured not one but two methods of crawling. He can “get low” and do an army crawl and strategically get to where he wants and you don’t even know until stuff starts falling.

Or he can beat you with speed and “go high” and out race you to the goal.

It’s like a Corvette racing a garbage truck and you are not the sports car.

Speaking of garbage that little boy goes to the bathroom like a grown man. No I don’t mean has bad aim and misses the toilet and leaves the seat up.

No in volume he’s gotta be pooping his weight on a daily basis, hell some days I think he exceeds it. I mean you talk about what goes in must come out. His “gross” national product (GNP), has to be more than most third world countries.

My wife and mother handle 99% of that and it’s the definition of “Waste Management”, those green garbage trucks on the street got nothing on my son.

Anyone with small kid should have a class “P” license because with a kid in the car you are "Special Waste Hauler” and the P is for poop.

Did I mention I love that little dude more than life itself?

Excuse me, I gotta go see what that little crumbsnatcher has gotten into next.

I know it’s not the most masculine car around but I have a lifelong love affair with this little car from VW.

I used to watch the original “Herbie the Love Bug” movies as a kid but it goes deeper than that.

So let me start 35 years ago, my late father bought a light blue 1969 VW Beetle as a project car. As with every other car that my father had, I loved it. As they say in the car business this vehicle had “character” that means it looked nice but was beat to hell.

The floor was rotting out (it was straight “Fred Flintstone” you could see the ground pass under you), engine was fine, seats were okay. It was the first car I ever saw with a sunroof and it was a manual crank sunroof at that.

Anyway dad had big plans for the little car, he got VW catalogs from his parts guys, we went to at least one VW Bug car show and looked at custom VW’s and got ideas to fix the car up, it was going be great.
But two things happened, one is that at that time we had so many cars at the old house on 123rd Street, the VW had to sit on the street in front of the house. The other is when dad did start working on it, the floorboards and under carriage was pretty far gone. It would take a lot of work and money just to get the structure right.

I learned back then sometimes working on cars means you can’t “save” every car. Some are too far gone and so was this VW, so even though dad did get some customizing on it (wheels &amp; exhaust), the project had to stop and the car was sold unfinished.

Fast forward 15 years, I’m at DePaul University and a friend of a friend bought a “New Beetle”. So as only college kids do, we piled in that VW like the proverbial clowns at the circus. Not a bad little car. I immediately thought of my dad’s old VW and it didn’t compare.

Fast forward another six years and another friend bought a “New Beetle” and we went out to dinner and took a spin. Her’s was really nice, black with a manual transmission and drove really nice. She had bought it from a mutual friend who had upgraded to the turbo model and got a steal on it.

I’m real familiar with VW’s because my Godmother (Dolores), has been a VW owner for nearly 30 years, first with a Golf and then the last 20 years owning Jettas. I almost bought a Jetta III after college because of her experience but a dealership (that is long out of business), tried to sell me one with a flat tire. They also tried to sell me a “New Beetle” back then but I was image conscious (I was 23 years old), and they were pricey at the time.

So now I see a lot of used “New Beetles” out there, with surprisingly low miles for under $ 7,000.

I’ve noticed a red one at a used car lot on the way to my mother’s house, it’s been there since the summer. Means there might need more work on it (especially for sitting for seven months), but now I’m 40 years old, could care less what people think of what I drive.

Even at this year’s Chicago Auto Show I went over the VW section and looked at a few “New Beetles” (pictured), I wish I could explain the attraction, but maybe it’s just thinking of that little blue Bug my dad didn't finish.

There are more specialty used car lots with classic cars, more older cars for sale on Craigslist and even in people’s front yards.

The auctions that have the best of the collector cars (Mecum, Barrett-Jackson, Auctions America, etc.), are packed with cars and consumers and get more TV coverage than ever.

But be aware cars in those auctions are usually the “best of the best” and are of museum quality.

Rarely will a car of that level be available for sale on the “open market.” People do compare prices to those cars, just be observant of what kind of car crosses their auction block. And then check out the car you are looking at.

I first started attending collector car shows (Rod &amp; Custom shows as my late dad called them), on my own starting about 10 years ago. I did attend some when I was in college but not watching closely like I do now.

I’ve found that within 10-15 years (of a car being in production), is the window to get a good collector car before the price raises. So that means if there’s a car you like going back to 2000, this is the time to think about getting one.

Obviously there are exceptions, the Ford GT from 10 years ago which was a six figure car to start with has really skyrocketed in the last few years to now it’s a quarter to half million dollar car.

I’m going to list a lot of cars over the last 10-15 years that may become collectibles or have special value.

Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS’ from the early 2000’s especially special edition Intimidator (2005), or Jeff Gordon (2003), or maybe the supercharged editions in 2004 &amp; 2005. These are dirt cheap but a lot of them are not in great shape, so “buyer beware”.

A real interesting vehicle is the Chevrolet Trailblazer SS (pictured), now in the mid 2000’s Chevrolet threw the SS badge on virtually every model but this one might be the most valuable and the quickest. The predecessor to it was the GMC Typhoon from the early 1990's and its become a collector favorite and has moderate value.

It will be interesting to see where the Dodge Charger R/T &amp; SRT8 &amp; Challenger SRT8 &amp; 392 end up. Not to forget the Dodge Magnum SRT8 and Chrysler 300 Hemi C.  Those models started in the mid 2000’s and SRT8’s have remained desirable and should be worth the most, keep an eye on the Challenger, that might be a valuable car down the road, most have not dropped below $v 25,000 in value.

Chevrolet outdid itself with the C5 Corvette (1998-2004), it truly became a supercar in this generation, that and the early C6 (2006-2009), models might realty get up there price wise.

Two rare cars are the Dodge SRT-4 (2003-2005), Neon &amp; SRT Caliber (2008-09), both have a really loyal following like previous turbo Dodges (Spirit R/T &amp; Omni GLH), and are hard to find but not out of reach financially. You can get a good SRT-4 Neon still for $ 10,000, the Caliber is a little more, and this might be a good car to get simply for the low production numbers and legendary turbo performance.

I’ll be honest I have no idea where the Pontiac GTO will go. It was the 2004-2006 based on the Australian Holden Commodore and it’s a decent buy right now ($ 15,000- $ 20,000), it had a Corvette engine (5.7 liter in ’04, 6.0 liter after that), but looked like a Grand Prix. Same goes for its four door “mate” the G8 but a lot of power in those cars, could be a just a fun car and hard to get Corvette power that cheap.

It seems the Dodge Viper might be going away again, it’s a low production supercar that is around six figures new, might go up, the originals from the early 1990’s have held their value.

Asian imports have been gaining value quickly and I wonder if the Subaru WRX STI, Mitsubishi Evolution (EVO), Nissan 350Z and cars like that will get up like there like the Toyota Supra (those from the 1990’s have skyrocketed), and going back to the Datsun 280Z. My guess is these will have some value.

I personally like the Cadillac V Series cars, some more Corvette technology but in a luxury package, in past Cadillac’s don’t have a ton of value on the used car market until they have significant age, this may change.

A real sleeper is the Cadillac XLR (2004-2007), looks like a Corvette, same engine, built in the same plant (Bowling Green, KY), and has retractable hard top. It’s a $ 20,000 car now, see if it goes anywhere.

Also don’t forget the Saturn Sky &amp; Pontiac Solstice, they were roadsters for the now defunct GM brands, low production cars that might gain some value, look at the Plymouth Prowler, it got a life of its own in the last decade or so.

Lastly but not least the Ford Mustang, especially Boss 302 and Shelby versions have done really well for older models (1960’s &amp; early 1970’s), in recent years. It’s weird with them, the fox body versions (late 1980’s to mid-1990’s), are still affordable but in 2005 the remodel on them went retro and it got some power and limited editions, it’s a car to watch.

All of this is just my opinion from a lifetime around cars, the most important thing about buying a collector car is buy a car you like, then if it doesn't make a ton of money at least you're not stuck with a car you don't like.

It was one of lowest points of my life, he died suddenly and only months after the 9/11 tragedy and not quite a year removed from losing my oldest brother.

My uncle “Mahat” was a beloved figure in our family. He was a successful businessman, devoted husband, had a green thumb and excellent with plants. He cooked the best grilled fish you ever had and I still can’t replicate his recipe all these years later.

He never forgot birthday, always gave the women of the family flowers for Valentines, just an incredible man who was one my biggest fans and earliest readers of my writing.

He was soft spoken but hilarious, a business professional who seamlessly moved from a buyer for Sears to the world of plant rental and was later involved in a partnership of an independent plant business.

I used to run into him on the Northside during his workday and when I was done with school at DePaul University. His clients were some of the better known businesses on the Gold Coast (where he lived for years), and in Lincoln Park.

But he was also comfortable in his native south side and also in the ‘hood.

There was no one he couldn’t talk to and relate to, no business he couldn’t work with and anyone he talked to he made you feel like the most important person in the room.

If you didn’t know him you might think he was “uppity”, but if you knew him, he was a friend and one of the coolest cats to ever walk this earth.

A dedicated NBA basketball fan, he recorded the great NBA games of the 1980’s and had a library of Michael Jordan games too.

His taste in music was second to none, my aunt gave me his music (amazing collection of records &amp; tapes), and equipment (a mint condition Technics system), and to this day it’s in my loft where I enjoy and reminisce about our good times together.

Before I knew what a renaissance man was, I just thought my uncle was cool. Because he was, without trying or telling you.

I ate with him at the finest restaurants that the Northside offered back in the 1980’s. He introduced me to places like Harry’s, Sweetwater (it’s now Gibson’s), Hillary’s on the 7th floor of Water Tower and the Bigg’s Mansion.

We also chowed down on Rib’s N Bibs on 53rd Street in Hyde Park, Army &amp; Lou’s on 75th Street and Home of the Hoagy on 111th Street.

He taught me to have the class of downtown and the casualness of our native Southside. Maybe most important that there was no place a black man couldn’t go.

He taught me how to be professional but not “sell out” and how to talk to anyone and be respectful.

He refined my palate, opened my ears to the great sound of jazz and old school R&amp;B and how the game of basketball should be played.

He had an eye for art, a tender hand for plants and how to respect a woman. He treated my aunt like a queen and respected my grandparents like royalty too.

Outside of my late father, no man taught me more but this was all by example he didn’t have to preach, he walked the talk with a smooth stroll and I’m still trying to emulate his stride.

I miss my man dearly but rely on his advice and live by his example every day.

101 years prior to Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery Alabama that sparked the 1950’s civil rights movements. Elizabeth Jennings started a similar movement in 1850’s New York City.

Elizabeth was a church organist at First Colored Congregational Church on Sixth Street &amp; Second Ave she and went to catch the streetcar to go to church on July 16, 1854.

Now I preface this that back then (remember this is pre-civil war era), the privately owned street cars in New York City weren’t just segregated, most flat out refused to serve African Americans with signs stating their policy. Those that didn’t post their policy left the decision of African American ridership to the driver’s discretion.

Elizabeth boarded the street car at Pearl &amp; Chatham with a female friend and ignored the sign and boarded the horse drawn street car anyway. The driver initially stated they needed to leave but then said if any white passengers took issue she would have to leave.

Things escalated quickly and the conductor tried to physically remove Elizabeth from the streetcar and then with the assistance of a police officer threw her off into the street.

However Elizabeth was more than just another church lady, she was a school teacher with friends in the abolitionist movement including her father who was involved with the legendary Abyssinian Baptist Church.

She wrote her story of what happened that Sunday and no less than Frederick Douglass himself reprinted it for his publication as did the New York Daily Tribune, edited by known abolitionist Horace Greeley.

Her father also hired a young white lawyer named Chester Arthur, yes the man who would be president of the United States 27 years later in 1881 upon the death of James A. Garfield. He tried and won her case and $ 225.00 in damages. However he had sought $ 500.00 and she had to pay $ 22.50 in court costs.

But her case was the precedent for all future public transit segregation cases.

But this was not the end of firsts for Elizabeth Jennings, she married Charles Graham and they had a son who unfortunately died during the 1863 draft riots. Their son was sickly and didn’t die due to the riots (which were about the $ 300 fee to avoid the Civil War draft), but their son had to be buried during the riots in Brooklyn.

Also due to the riots the family had to temporarily move out of New York City and settled in Eatontown, New Jersey.

Imagine having suffered that type of personal loss and then having that kind of social unrest.

Elizabeth Jennings Graham was not done yet, after years of teaching in the New York public school system and passing of her husband (in 1867), she started the first kindergarten in New York City for African American children. She started it on the first floor of her house on west 41st Street. She stated “Love of the beautiful will be instilled into these youthful minds.”

She ran her school until she died in 1901 where she was buried with her husband and son in Brooklyn.

Okay so he’s 8 months old.

But this a tradition I shared with my late father who first took me when I was probably six or seven years old. I remember standing in line downstairs at the old McCormick Place (Lakeside Center), when the trucks were downstairs and cars upstairs. And my dad explaining engines and showing me car parts. Of course my dad’s favorite section was the vendors in the back selling car wax, rags, rims and every other auto accessory under the sun.

I first must thanks the gracious staff at the front of the Chicago Auto Show for accommodating my family with my son’s large jogging stroller and my cell phone that was problematic with my electronic tickets.  Yeah I was “that guy”, tying up the line Saturday morning.

I also want to thank the two GMC reps for taking the time to talk to us (we own a 2005 GMC Envoy Denali), about the new Acadia.

Also big ups to Chevrolet for their comfortable cell phone charging station and that we could feed my son a bottle there as well.

Yeah in my over 30 years of attending the Chicago Auto Show, it a totally different experience with a stroller and an eight month old. But like I said the staff was excellent and other gracious patrons as I tried to get photos for future blogs and talk to reps.

My son is used to being out and among people, so he was not overwhelmed, in fact about halfway through he got bored. I knew I had about a two hour window to get through the whole show and that’s about what he gave us, thanks son.

At several times I took my son out of his stroller and showed him the Cadillac engines, which he was amused by and together we sat in a Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.

That was special.

It means so much to me to share the traditions that my father started with me with my son. I know he won’t remember that this young age but still we have pictures.

I think my son was disappointed there were not “Oball Cars” there. Yes that’s the toy car he plays with right now, I just ordered a second one so we can race. Remember he’s 8 months old.

It doesn’t stop me from having him watch Motorweek, Barrett-Jackson &amp; Mecum classic car auctions and several other car shows.

Yes I’m hoping he’s a “car guy” like my dad was and my brother is but maybe not. I was a car guy when I was young, faded away from it as a teenager and then came back full force as a young adult.

I want my son to be his own man and do what he loves but I will give him inspiration and ideas of what I love and what his late grandfather was into as well.

As for his first auto show, well he slept at the end and was tired the whole second half but it was being there that counted that we could share that time together.

He’s becoming a little boy and I cherish every moment we get together, no matter what that might be doing but I prefer car stuff and hope he does too.

I think my son was disappointed there were not “Oball Cars” there. Yes that’s the toy car he plays with right now, I just ordered a second one so we can race. Remember he’s 8 months old.

It doesn’t stop me from having him watch Motorweek, Barrett-Jackson &amp; Mecum classic car auctions and several other car shows.

Yes I’m hoping he’s a “car guy” like my dad was and my brother is but maybe not. I was a car guy when I was young, faded away from it as a teenager and then came back full force as a young adult.

I want my son to be his own man and do what he loves but I will give him inspiration and ideas of what I love and what his late grandfather was into as well.

As for his first auto show, well he slept at the end and was tired the whole second half but it was being there that counted that we could share that time together.

He’s becoming a little boy and I cherish every moment we get together, no matter what that might be doing but I prefer car stuff and hope he does too.

I don’t know why but I’ve become enamored with it. I slow down to look at it every time I drive past.
It’s a Hyundai Tiburon, probably a 2003 or 2004, I’m pretty sure it doesn’t run because it hasn’t moved, its tires are low and sits in the same spot. The body looks fine outside its dirty.

For a short about of time there was a sign on it but I couldn’t read it from the street and was I battling an upper respiratory infection and figured I get to the car and go to the house the next week and by then the sign was off. The car is still sitting there.

Look I know the car is not a classic and with flat tires and not running for months, that’s already a few hundred just to get it going and maybe replace the tires.

Okay so let me be honest here, this car reminds me of my first car a light blue 1986 Nissan 200SX. Its a little import hatchback like it and a darker shade of blue, even has grey wheels like it. So there’s some nostalgia going on here.

It doesn’t look to be leaking any large amounts of fluid, at least not dripping down the driveway into the street.

Since its sitting outside would have to make sure nothing is or was living in it. Also need to check brake lines, they might collapse and sometimes brake pads “seize up” too. The battery might be dead, so might need to replace that too.

The car sits in the driveway on a busy street, might be some chipped paint, salt damage or other touch up work needed, I can do that, no big deal.

Then of course I need to store it, no room at my place, that’s what stopped me from getting a “project car” so far, well that an a lack of cash.

But why let a little thing like that stop me? My father used to keep cars in the backyard (which I don’t have), and had an account at the credit union for stuff like that.

I haven’t gone to the house to ask about the car, though I’ve asked people about cars before, usually that tactic doesn’t work.

I once asked a neighbor about his 1987 red Ford Thunderbird and he wasn’t interested in selling it. I told him to keep me in mind if he ever changed his mind. Unfortunately I think the old man has passed or is in a nursing home. The car is gone and the house is for sale and I haven’t seen him in a while.

See for us car guys, a car is more than just transportation, even a crappy car usually has some meaning or you’re gonna get around to fixing it up. Selling the car is like giving up on it and us car guys usually think a car can be saved. That one day you’ll find the time, the money and get that car going again.

I’ve told you about my dad’s 1967 Camaro, a project car that never got finished but we found a good home for it. I know we speak about cars like a pet or a person.

I can’t explain it when you are a car guy, I’ve owned nine cars in a little over 20 years and several of those I really couldn’t afford but bought them anyway.

But I’ll be still looking at that Tiburon.

We had my grandparents wedding anniversary there around 1993 &amp; 1994 and dined there a few other times.

The place was called The Retreat and it was a serious white table cloth establishment, a rarity even in Pullman but definitely not seen on the south side of Chicago. It was more than a “retreat” it was refreshing to have a “grown folks restaurant” so close to home.

John is a Chicago guy who attended Chicago State University and had his culinary studies at Washburne trade school. He also worked at the University Club in Hyde Park before striking out on his own.

John’s next and current venture is BJ’s Market, a casual yet very good soul food restaurant. It has a buffet but the servers fill your plate or to go box.

John doesn’t skimp on the soul but makes it healthier, he makes killer collard greens but has turkey in them. He inspired me to put turkey in my collards when I make them at home.
But his mustard fried catfish is the star dish.

BJ’s first location is on Stony Island just south of 87th Street, they have Sunday brunch and serve breakfast as well as lunch and dinner.

He then had a location for a while in Beverly on Western around 97th Street, it’s since closed. I lived there, that was my after church spot when I lived in the city and often after work dinner.

If had to go to Little Company of Mary Hospital to check on a relative or do business on 95th Street, I had to go and get me some catfish and greens from BJ’s.

He also has another location in Gresham on 79th, just east of Racine near St Sabina’s.

John also does catering I hear from the Stony Island BJ’s location.

I had learned from another restaurant and my former co-workers in south suburban Matteson that some people put mustard on their catfish as a condiment. Let me tell you that’s an intoxicating way to have your catfish.
John took it a step further and has it in the mix when he cooks the catfish. People come from far and wide to get John’s catfish.

Don’t believe me, go to Taste of Chicago this summer (BJ’s market has been participating for at least 15 years), and you will find long lines of people to get an order of catfish. Yes I am one of those people standing in line waiting. Last year I first got a “taste size” order of catfish and then before I left I used the last of my tickets to get more.

But John’s fish was so popular that they ran out. Literally so many people came for catfish that they ate all of the fish and the workers had to go get more and said it was a 30 minute wait. I’ve never seen so many people “bummed out” over a restaurant selling out of food.

When it was announced that they ran out of catfish, there was a “collective groan” from the lines of people and we all walked away slowly and disappointed.

But that’s just a testament to John and the quality of food at his restaurants, never had a bad meal there, always good staff and took many friends and family to enjoy his food.

John is a culinary hero for his commitment to the neighborhoods and his excellent food.

I grew up on the end of West Pullman on 123rd Street and right at 124th &amp; Ashland was the Gulfport Café.

When it opened in 1983 my life changed forever, I believe it was a former truck stop or diner (we never went there), but once the Gulfport opened we lived there.

Chef Taylor came from the top rated L ’Escargot restaurant in downtown Chicago and he was their sous chef. He brought his maître ’d with him and they co-owned the new restaurant.

You talk about following a dream, Chef Taylor left the established, highly rated kitchen at one of the best restaurants in Chicago, started a small independent southern/Cajun restaurant in a racially changing residential suburb bordering the end of Chicago.

And do all that and still be recognized as a great chef &amp; entrepreneur in the press and admired by us locals.

Though my grandparents came from Louisiana &amp; Texas, and even as a young child I knew about a lot of southern foods, my palate was groomed at the Gulfport.

The Gulfport Café got its name from the hometown of Chef Taylor and he did his hometown proud. He started as a chef down south before refining his skills here in Chicago.

The Gulfport was a non-nondescript little restaurant with authentic southern artifacts on the wall and some of the best jazz and blues playing on the stereo system.

Yes the music influenced me too even though as young person I was not really into jazz and blues that much but the music from this joint and my mother’s jazz influence came in handy when I finally appreciated jazz in college.
But it was all about the food at Gulfport, Chef Taylor put his foot into each and every dish. Hell he could have made a dish with his foot in the pot and it still would have been good.

Never before or since have I ever seen a place make authentic jambalaya with sauce on the side. And man that sauce was fire, he would warn you about the heat of it yet bring a gravy boat full of it. My late father once drowned his jambalaya in that high heat gravy and ate he it and screamed like a cat in heat.

I’m still looking for someone who made lobster bisque like his, man it had heat, came to the table bright red like the devil’s sweat but was not burning, just flowing with flavor.

He had garlic toast sent to every table, just little pieces of garlic bread that had kissed the toaster and had the right crust and nothing like any kind of garlic or toast you had ever tasted.

The flavor in the food was pure love there (never had a bad meal), the people were great, it was the kind of place that people talked about. He was always written up in the Chicago Sun Times, Tribune and in Ebony magazine.
And I grew up down the street from it.

I went to high school (Brother Rice), and my guidance counselor (former Tinley Park mayor Ed Zabrocki), looked at my home address and said “You live by the Gulfport restaurant, I love that place”.

But all good things must end and by the time I graduated high school, the Gulfport closed in 1994. To my recollection it never went down in quality but the area changed, southern/Cajun was no longer trendy. Though for some of us it was never trendy, it was dinner.

Since then its been Geno's Place (which does have some southern food), and that's what pictured.

Regardless, things change and the nearest authentic Cajun restaurant (The Maple Tree Inn), in Beverly was now growing. I once heard Chef Taylor was there for a while and I also heard he had a place in south suburban Country Club Hills, but never couldn’t verify either story.

Still I will never forget the 11 years my old neighborhood was Cajun Central and the man who lead it, taught us all so much and fed us really well.

I grew up on the end of West Pullman on 123rd Street and right at 124th &amp; Ashland was the Gulfport Café.

When it opened in 1983 my life changed forever, I believe it was a former truck stop or diner (we never went there), but once the Gulfport opened we lived there.

Chef Taylor came from the top rated L ’Escargot restaurant in downtown Chicago and he was their sous chef. He brought his maître ’d with him and they co-owned the new restaurant.

You talk about following a dream, Chef Taylor left the established, highly rated kitchen at one of the best restaurants in Chicago, started a small independent southern/Cajun restaurant in a racially changing residential suburb bordering the end of Chicago.

And do all that and still be recognized as a great chef &amp; entrepreneur in the press and admired by us locals.

Though my grandparents came from Louisiana &amp; Texas, and even as a young child I knew about a lot of southern foods, my palate was groomed at the Gulfport.

The Gulfport Café got its name from the hometown of Chef Taylor and he did his hometown proud. He started as a chef down south before refining his skills here in Chicago.

The Gulfport was a non-nondescript little restaurant with authentic southern artifacts on the wall and some of the best jazz and blues playing on the stereo system.

Yes the music influenced me too even though as young person I was not really into jazz and blues that much but the music from this joint and my mother’s jazz influence came in handy when I finally appreciated jazz in college.
But it was all about the food at Gulfport, Chef Taylor put his foot into each and every dish. Hell he could have made a dish with his foot in the pot and it still would have been good.

Never before or since have I ever seen a place make authentic jambalaya with sauce on the side. And man that sauce was fire, he would warn you about the heat of it yet bring a gravy boat full of it. My late father once drowned his jambalaya in that high heat gravy and ate he it and screamed like a cat in heat.

I’m still looking for someone who made lobster bisque like his, man it had heat, came to the table bright red like the devil’s sweat but was not burning, just flowing with flavor.

He had garlic toast sent to every table, just little pieces of garlic bread that had kissed the toaster and had the right crust and nothing like any kind of garlic or toast you had ever tasted.

The flavor in the food was pure love there (never had a bad meal), the people were great, it was the kind of place that people talked about. He was always written up in the Chicago Sun Times, Tribune and in Ebony magazine.
And I grew up down the street from it.

I went to high school (Brother Rice), and my guidance counselor (former Tinley Park mayor Ed Zabrocki), looked at my home address and said “You live by the Gulfport restaurant, I love that place”.

But all good things must end and by the time I graduated high school, the Gulfport closed in 1994. To my recollection it never went down in quality but the area changed, southern/Cajun was no longer trendy. Though for some of us it was never trendy, it was dinner.

Since then its been Geno's Place (which does have some southern food), and that's what pictured.

Regardless, things change and the nearest authentic Cajun restaurant (The Maple Tree Inn), in Beverly was now growing. I once heard Chef Taylor was there for a while and I also heard he had a place in south suburban Country Club Hills, but never couldn’t verify either story.

Still I will never forget the 11 years my old neighborhood was Cajun Central and the man who lead it, taught us all so much and fed us really well.
