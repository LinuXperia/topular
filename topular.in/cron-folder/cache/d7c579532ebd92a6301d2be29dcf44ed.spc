(Seriously, hospitals, that should be a thing.)

But anyway, last Saturday I felt sick to my stomach, nauseous, and it hurt weird in my side. Baby Girl had the shits. I figured we both had a stomach bug. We both rested up that day.

Sunday, the pain in my side was worse. It was right where the appendix is supposed to be.

And we had JUST promised not to go to the hospital again this year. My body is an asshole. Thanks, asshole body. I guess it's a testament to Northwestern that my body likes them so much. Maybe it's because they take better care of it than I do. Seriously, all the tension I hold all the time makes my back all kinked up, and I can crack it like nobody's business, and it freaks people out.

I looked at everything online, revising my searches based on what I found. It's a thing--once you figure out the right terminology for what you're feeling, it improves searches. (Friendly librarian tip of the day!)

"Pain in right side hurts to bend."
"Pain in LRQ."
Rebound tenderness pain LRQ."

Either it was cancer or appendicitis. Might possibly be a cyst, but that was wayyyy down on the rankings of possibility.

I really didn't want to go to the hospital. "Let's wait it out. Maybe it'll go away."

Isn't that a great philosophy? But alas, my husband is a stickler for the rules. And everything online said "if you think it's the appendix, go to the ER."

Well, shit. We did. Pain meds (glorious pain meds) and tests and a clingy 1 year old who really preferred sitting with Mama in the hospital bed, instead of Daddy in the chair. Who cares that I need an IV put in, or that sitting on my tummy made it hurt? She wanted cuddles!

The CT scan showed nothing wrong with the appendix or the ovaries, although they noted fluid down in my pelvic region. So in short, they had no idea what was wrong, but I'm doing okay and here's some pain meds for a few days and follow up with my doctor within two weeks. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/running-with-a-book-cart/files/2016/02/scumbag.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1962" alt="scumbag" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/running-with-a-book-cart/files/2016/02/scumbag-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>

I went home and Googled. Still could be appendicitis--often people miss it in women because they think it's the ovaries when it's really not. SO IT COULD STILL BE APPENDICITIS. SHIT.

I saw my OBGYN, and her theory is that it's actually a ovarian cyst that popped. Hence the pain (the right ovary is really close to the appendix) and the fluid. If the pain continues for a week, come back in for more tests.

The pain went away Weds.

In this case--take toxic "jokes." A toxic joke is a joke made at somebody's expense--specifically to get a dig in at them (for whatever perverse reason). But, if you dare to protest the joke, they'll just say, "But it was just a joke!" That's the beauty of the "joking." Toxic parents see it as an automatic out. No way can they be held accountable for it, right?

This is <em>not</em> the occasional teasing. Parents do like to tease their kids sometimes, spouses tease each other, but it is enveloped in a pattern of love and trust. When there is not a pattern of trust between a parent and child, then teasing is harmful, meant to eventually undermine your sense of self. It makes it hard to stand up to others who make cruel jokes about you, because you DON'T KNOW that it is abusive. You're so used to this form of abuse. It takes a long time to figure it out.

In my experience, if I didn't laugh at the joke or felt bad, it is a direct affront to my dad's brilliant sense of humor because I didn't laugh. When I didn't laugh, I made him look bad, which made him look like a bad parent, and I am never allowed to do that. It might lead to the silent treatment, or it might lead to him to blow up at some other minor misstep I later made.

But I thought this was normal for parents to do this. That it's normal to feel bad and ashamed. At least, until my dad made a "joke" about me in front of my now- husband.

We were dating, and I spent so much time at his family's house (gee, I wonder why?) that I felt like we should try to hang out at my family's house for a while. We talked awkwardly with my dad in the living room for a while, and then I had to go to the bathroom. When I came back, my boyfriend looked distinctly uncomfortable. He started having an asthma attack from all the anxiety and stress from being around my dad, and we cut the visit short. Actually, he thought we'd been there for HOURS instead of an hour because it was so uncomfortable.

It turns out that dad made a joke about women being expensive and whiny, that he had to give me $20 to pay for the skirt my sister's dog poked a hole in. I was upset since I had saved up for the skirt, and asked my sister to train her dog. My dad thought I was whining, and had my mom give me $20 to shut me up.

My boyfriend  had a really hard time not being visibly upset about the misogynistic comment that it sent him into an asthma attack from the stress. We made excuses and left early. Actually, he thought we'd been there for <em>hours</em> when it was only an hour, because it was so stressful being around my dad.

It was then that I realized more a) just how stressful it was at home if he couldn't handle it for a long time, and b) just how toxic my dad's jokes were. He saw it as incredibly, unbelievably offensive, but I was used to such things being a joke.

Because I grew up with it.

P.S. If you can't wrap your head around the idea that a parent can make harmful jokes, you are very fortunate.

In writing class we were always taught to identify the good things first before launching into the critical part.

Here are the good things.

<strong>Hormonal changes during and after pregnancy are NORMAL. </strong>This is true. Huge changes happen, and it can be frightening if it's your first time or tenth time.

<strong>Mood changes are NORMAL</strong>. <strong></strong>Also true. It comes with the hormonal changes, plus your whole life is changing. It's nice to know you're not the only one.

<strong>Meditation helps. Prayer helps. </strong>This can be true for some people. But if you are not the spiritual kind, this boils down to "take time for self-care," whatever is the best self-care for you.

<strong>Nutritional support helps. Love helps. </strong>The latter two are the most true. It's good to keep nourishing your body through these changes (and I should talk--my anxiety was through the roof and I barely ate for two weeks after my daughter was born.) It's also so, so important to have supportive people around you, people who don't say, "You're just being a martyr" or "Get over it."

Now, here the problem with Marianne's post. By talking about changes that are NORMAL, she is minimizing the times when it is abnormal. Maybe someone is having a trauma reaction. Maybe their existing depression is getting worse. Maybe the changes are setting off postpartum psychosis, but if you told her about that, she'd say, "But mood changes are NORMAL!"

The trick is that there is a range when it comes to mood changes. There's the normal levels of mood changes, and there's the abnormal levels. How can you tell when the baby blues are becoming abnormal? Through the screening.

In the comments below, Marianne tells someone,
<blockquote>"I have never said that psychotherapeutic drugs are never positive, or that serious mental illness does not exist"</blockquote>
BUT by vilifying the screening process and talking meditation and prayer, she is minimizing mental illnesses until it <em>almost</em> no longer exists.

And she's also qualifying it by saying "<strong>serious</strong> mental illness." How does she define "serious"? Is it serious enough when your child cries, and you don't feel anything? When you are unable to eat or sleep for weeks? Or is it only serious when you get to the point of suicide?

Let's back up a little bit--Marianne asks a decent question cloaked in anti-medication sentiment: "How many are on big pharma's payroll?" Let's <a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/about-the-uspstf" target="_blank">check</a>.

Using this<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/" target="_blank"> database</a>, I was able to determine that Dr. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/doctors/pid/71041" target="_blank">Francisco Garcia</a> was taken to lunch 6 times, Dr. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/doctors/pid/28621" target="_blank">Alex Krist </a>once, by pharmaceutical representatives. That is two out of sixteen, and neither of them are chairpersons. I wouldn't necessarily describe them as being on pharmaceutical payrolls, and only Dr. Garcia was taken to lunch by Abilify, which Marianne vilifies.

What money is there to follow? Meals do not necessarily make doctors more biased toward prescribing certain drugs. And one doctor talking with psychotherapeutic pharmaceutical companies wouldn't bias the entire study, thanks to the balancing force of the 15 other doctors on the team. That's the beauty of having an independent review team--it helps to ensure that such recommendations are done without undue influence from any one source--including Big Pharma.

Now, this brings us to the final issue I have with Marianne's post--the issue of "finding the right medication." What does the<a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1" target="_blank"> recommendation </a>actually say? When Marianne put that into quotes, it made me (and likely others) assume it was a quote from the recommendation. It is <strong>not</strong>. It only mentions medication twice--once about having adequate support to ensure people who need medication get it, and once pointing out that it can get expensive.

Interestingly, the team stated that "only 1 small, short-term trial of screen-detected depression in postpartum women included antidepressants as an intervention." All other interventions focused on CBT, cognitive behavior therapy, "which had adequate evidence that treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women with depression." They also  found that second generation SSRIs are associated with some harms, listing the side effects. These harms were only "small to moderate."

It really does not sound like the team is promoting the "mercenary intentions" of Abilify, as Marianne eloquently put it in another comment.

So, where's the harm in screening women? What does the recommendation say?
<blockquote>Only 1 trial, which focused on the effects of screening alone in postpartum women, specifically reported on adverse effects of screening and found none.<sup><a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation15">15</a></sup> None of the other screening trials showed any signals of concern. The literature search did not identify additional trials addressing harms of screening.

and

Therefore, it is important that a range of treatment options are available for pregnant and postpartum women with depression who are identified through screening and that treatment choices are made through shared decision making.</blockquote>
Doctors and women should make the decision together about what's right for them and the child, essentially.

So, where is the problem, Marianne? I recommend some meditation and prayer to allow yourself to look into the real reasons why you are so frightened of Big Pharma to the point that you are reading ill intentions into a reasonable recommendation. I suspect the answer is in you somewhere.

Also prayerfully consider the negative impact statements such as yours have on pregnant and postpartum women. Women may hesitate to seek help even when they are really suffering for fear that people will think the same way you do.

Now, here the problem with Marianne's post. By talking about changes that are NORMAL, she is minimizing the times when it is abnormal. Maybe someone is having a trauma reaction. Maybe their existing depression is getting worse. Maybe the changes are setting off postpartum psychosis, but if you told her about that, she'd say, "But mood changes are NORMAL!"

The trick is that there is a range when it comes to mood changes. There's the normal levels of mood changes, and there's the abnormal levels. How can you tell when the baby blues are becoming abnormal? Through the screening.

In the comments below, Marianne tells someone,
<blockquote>"I have never said that psychotherapeutic drugs are never positive, or that serious mental illness does not exist"</blockquote>
BUT by vilifying the screening process and talking meditation and prayer, she is minimizing mental illnesses until it <em>almost</em> no longer exists.

And she's also qualifying it by saying "<strong>serious</strong> mental illness." How does she define "serious"? Is it serious enough when your child cries, and you don't feel anything? When you are unable to eat or sleep for weeks? Or is it only serious when you get to the point of suicide?

Let's back up a little bit--Marianne asks a decent question cloaked in anti-medication sentiment: "How many are on big pharma's payroll?" Let's <a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/about-the-uspstf" target="_blank">check</a>.

Using this<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/" target="_blank"> database</a>, I was able to determine that Dr. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/doctors/pid/71041" target="_blank">Francisco Garcia</a> was taken to lunch 6 times, Dr. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/doctors/pid/28621" target="_blank">Alex Krist </a>once, by pharmaceutical representatives. That is two out of sixteen, and neither of them are chairpersons. I wouldn't necessarily describe them as being on pharmaceutical payrolls, and only Dr. Garcia was taken to lunch by Abilify, which Marianne vilifies.

What money is there to follow? Meals do not necessarily make doctors more biased toward prescribing certain drugs. And one doctor talking with psychotherapeutic pharmaceutical companies wouldn't bias the entire study, thanks to the balancing force of the 15 other doctors on the team. That's the beauty of having an independent review team--it helps to ensure that such recommendations are done without undue influence from any one source--including Big Pharma.

Now, this brings us to the final issue I have with Marianne's post--the issue of "finding the right medication." What does the<a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1" target="_blank"> recommendation </a>actually say? When Marianne put that into quotes, it made me (and likely others) assume it was a quote from the recommendation. It is <strong>not</strong>. It only mentions medication twice--once about having adequate support to ensure people who need medication get it, and once pointing out that it can get expensive.

Interestingly, the team stated that "only 1 small, short-term trial of screen-detected depression in postpartum women included antidepressants as an intervention." All other interventions focused on CBT, cognitive behavior therapy, "which had adequate evidence that treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves clinical outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women with depression." They also  found that second generation SSRIs are associated with some harms, listing the side effects. These harms were only "small to moderate."

It really does not sound like the team is promoting the "mercenary intentions" of Abilify, as Marianne eloquently put it in another comment.

So, where's the harm in screening women? What does the recommendation say?
<blockquote>Only 1 trial, which focused on the effects of screening alone in postpartum women, specifically reported on adverse effects of screening and found none.<sup><a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1#citation15">15</a></sup> None of the other screening trials showed any signals of concern. The literature search did not identify additional trials addressing harms of screening.

and

Therefore, it is important that a range of treatment options are available for pregnant and postpartum women with depression who are identified through screening and that treatment choices are made through shared decision making.</blockquote>
Doctors and women should make the decision together about what's right for them and the child, essentially.

So, where is the problem, Marianne? I recommend some meditation and prayer to allow yourself to look into the real reasons why you are so frightened of Big Pharma to the point that you are reading ill intentions into a reasonable recommendation. I suspect the answer is in you somewhere.

Also prayerfully consider the negative impact statements such as yours have on pregnant and postpartum women. Women may hesitate to seek help even when they are really suffering for fear that people will think the same way you do.

The theory is that my Effexor increase also increased the anxiety because it acted too strongly on the norepinephrine, going from 112mg to 150mg. It was supposed to help, but it was like helping construction workers by setting fire to the house.

A month of this, and no improvement. at. all. I mean, anxiety does increase sometimes when you change medicine. Then there was my surprise gallbladder surgery. And the holidays. Surely it could be those instead. But when it still didn't improve, I asked my psych for help.

I'm back on Lexapro. I had <a title="Pregnant and on antidepressants : Why I’m not worried" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/running-with-a-book-cart/2014/07/pregnant-and-on-antidepressants-why-im-not-worried/">gotten off of it</a> at my OB/GYN's request, because being pregnant while on an antidepressant is tricky enough, let alone two.

Once we lowered my Effexor, the stratospheric levels of anxiety tapered down in a couple of days. It was a huge relief. The depression still remains, but at least I'm not anxious as hell on top of it.

I think Lexapro may be starting to work. I'm getting these brief moments where I suddenly realize that the weight of the world isn't sitting on my shoulder, that my thoughts aren't heavily burdened.

Maybe. The anxiety has increased again, and I have no clue why. It just requires a little extra self-care right now, and a lot of reminders that people are not irritated or upset with me--which is a hard thing to remind myself.

I'm not well, but I'm not terrible either. I'm okay. Ish.

I'm reading "Listening to Prozac" right now--a bargain table find. I expected a dry book, but it's engaging, and it talks about people becoming "better than well" with the help of Prozac. In essence, people get so used to depression being normal, so when an antidepressant helps to mitigate the worst AND bring them to a more healthy mental state, it feels "better than well." Then, eventually, they realize it is a state of being well.

And once you feel that state of wellness, it is so wonderful, strange, freeing. Finally, you feel like you can adequately handle the world's stressors in a healthy way.

The funny thing is that I didn't realize that there WAS a better state of wellness instead of my old "normal," which was chronic ennui, depressive and self-defeating thoughts with a dash of futility. That's how I felt for so damn long, and every time I slip back down to that level, I hate it. It reminds me too much of growing up in my parents' house, which compounds the problem.

Perhaps it's because mamas feel like they need to do everything to prove to the world (or themselves) they are good parents.

Or maybe it's just me who's afraid of that.

I see my therapist frequently, and I still worry that she might say I'm going overboard with something or playing it up. I get extremely anxious wondering if my psychiatrist will think I'm just a drug-seeking fiend.

Here's a hint--if I even hint at feeling depressed, it's because I've been feeling like shit for a while, and was trying to figure out if it was a passing mood or something more insidious.

I'm fortunate to have so many supportive people around even when I barely tell them what's up. (Except in writing. Somehow I am slightly more honest with myself when writing.)

Even then, I hear some insensitive things sometimes, which makes it even harder to ask for help. Why ask if someone is going to try to one-up you or minimize it?

Being no-contact is easier as time goes on, (I promise, it does get easier for those of you just newly NC), but there are the hard days. Especially at certain times of the year, like Christmas. I kind of wished my mom could have been there when I was giving birth, but I did fortunately have a wonderful mother in law who was able to witness it.

It would have been nice to have visited my family on Baby Girl's first vacation, and meet her 2 other aunts and 3 other uncles. Think of all the love! But I know that's assuming they are more or less psychologically stable and not currently being abused, nor perpetuating the cycle of abuse. Unfortunately, it is still entirely too toxic.

I'm reminded of that when I think of how I felt when I wrote my <a title="Like tripping and falling forever" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/running-with-a-book-cart/2015/12/like-tripping-and-falling-forever/" target="_blank">last post</a>. And how I feel now.

I then think about my <a href="http://acestoohigh.com/got-your-ace-score/" target="_blank">ACE score</a>, (4) and how childhood trauma affects the body and the brain...forever. One thing about the ACE score is that it doesn't include other kinds of trauma that would definitely bring that score up, so mine could actually conceivably be higher--but this is a useful guideline.  According to the link "With an ACE score of 4 or more, things start getting serious. The likelihood of chronic pulmonary lung disease <a href="http://acestoohigh.com/category/ace-study/" target="_hplink">increases</a> 390 percent; hepatitis, 240 percent; depression 460 percent; suicide, 1,220 percent." That's just some of the stuff they looked at.

So no wonder I felt like absolute crap. And still do. No wonder I keep getting back into depression and nasty patterns of self-defeating thoughts and self-criticism.

My father swore at me when angry. He would act in ways that would make me afraid he would get physical on us, though he rarely did. He did the same to my mother and siblings. He controlled us. He lost his temper and would take it out through the "legit" way of punishment: spanking. He'd direct our tiniest movements when he was angry at us.  He'd aim a foot at the dogs when angry. He'd make fun of me to other people, and told me how expensive I was.
We lived in fear of his moods, waiting for him to snap.

Ostensibly, he had depression, but he is also narcissistic. What a mess.

Do I want her to see that it's okay for my dad, or anybody for that matter, to treat people that way? NO.

Do I want my daughter to feel the same way? Heck, no.

This is why I am not tempted to break no-contact this holiday season. My sweet, round-cheeked baby should not need to recover from her childhood. She shouldn't be witness to what me and my siblings have gone through. She should not have to feel the way I do.

Being no-contact is easier as time goes on, (I promise, it does get easier for those of you just newly NC), but there are the hard days. Especially at certain times of the year, like Christmas. I kind of wished my mom could have been there when I was giving birth, but I did fortunately have a wonderful mother in law who was able to witness it.

It would have been nice to have visited my family on Baby Girl's first vacation, and meet her 2 other aunts and 3 other uncles. Think of all the love! But I know that's assuming they are more or less psychologically stable and not currently being abused, nor perpetuating the cycle of abuse. Unfortunately, it is still entirely too toxic.

I'm reminded of that when I think of how I felt when I wrote my <a title="Like tripping and falling forever" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/running-with-a-book-cart/2015/12/like-tripping-and-falling-forever/" target="_blank">last post</a>. And how I feel now.

When your heart turns cold and makes your entire chest contract and ache and sending signals of the anticipation of pain all the way to your fingertips and down your back and legs? And do you know that moment of relief when you catch yourself and stand still on solid ground for a moment? And do you also know the moment when you do land up on the floor, bruised and embarrassed?

That's what anxiety feels like. That's me, right now, standing on the edge of <em>something</em>, not knowing if I'm going to fall or catch myself. Sometimes I'm even further over the edge, barely holding onto solid ground with the tips of my toes. Every added stress makes me even more worried that I'm going to fall. Sometimes I'm more balanced, able to withstand the changes in life without losing my balance even more. My chest aches all the time. My arms hurt. I feel burdened.

My anxiety is paired with depression. They're such an odd couple. The anxiety wants to do something, ANYTHING, just make it STOP, please. The anxiety is trying to figure out how to scramble back into stability. The problem is that each toe wiggle toward firm ground could also grab hold of loose dirt and make me slide further into the pit. It can't rest until we are at least a mile away from the edge.

The depression, on the other hand, sees the edge, and cares. It cares so deeply, but it is locked underneath a surface of unfeelingness. Depression knows we need to move away from the edge, but it has no energy to move. It just goes through the days, waiting for the surface to lift. So when anxiety ramps up, the two are caught in a battle. Sometimes the depression wins and simply collapses and does nothing. Sometimes anxiety wins, gets overwhelmed, and explodes before collapsing into a depression again.

I'd been slipping closer to that edge for a while, but I pretended it was temporary. The anxiety increased. I worried that it would mean I'm not a good mom. I started getting overwhelmed a lot more often. Consequently I was more unable to keep up with the house. People said it was just being a working mom. I guess that's true, but is it normal for a working mom to have no mental energy at the end of the day to do the dishes or the laundry?

I thought about getting help for a month or so but equivocated over whether it was "normal" or if it was indeed a symptom of a larger problem.

I finally asked for help over 3 weeks ago. My psychiatrist increased my medication, as we'd discussed previously. Winter and the holidays are always the worst for me.

A few days later, the anxiety ramped up. I had frightening thoughts and fears which culminated with a fear of my daughter falling into the river. There is a trap door panel on the bridges over the river, and I've always circled around it, but that day, I was so scared of it I went far away from that cursed trap door, and my brain embarked on a frightening imagined scenario of me being too close, the bridge bumping, and her falling in, would she slip out of the umbrella stroller, or would it strap her in and make her drown faster? Would she survive that drop? Would the water be too cold? Would I survive jumping right over after her? Wait, I should take my clothes off so I don't get weighed down. How can I take them off as fast as I can? My coat, my shoes, my pants. My glasses stay on so I can see her. I need to save her. Would she be floating? I'd rescue her. I'd keep her warm. Would the dirty water cause problems? We'd be in the hospital. I wouldn't be able to hear in the hospital with ruined hearing aids. Would insurance cover it? How could I work without my hearing aids? I should take my hearing aids off at that bridge. Then my coat and shoes and jump in and pull her and yell for help. I would hope someone called the ambulance as I jumped. Make them take the baby first--she goes first. She needs to get warm first...

Then I realized what my brain was doing, far too late. I was ruminating, and I was now extremely anxious. Actually, writing this made me so anxious right now I need a second dose of Ativan.

Which brings me to the second point. I'd also have unbidden anxiety attacks that came out of nowhere--not even a rumination. They happen a lot at work. Sometimes at home. My heart would be racing, and I'd feel pain. I'd feel like I was falling, forever. Then, the third week after increasing my antidepressant, I've fallen into an even deeper depression. I'd barely have energy to make dinner, then I'd feel anxious I'm failing as a mom because I'm making these slapped together dinners of bread and cheese and oranges for my daughter.

I finally told my psychiatrist about this. I finally got a prescription for Ativan--a short-term one to get me through to our appointment soon, after which will involve some medication adjusting and I'm apprehensive about that. How will I work while my brain chemistry is being fiddled with? How can I function?  Is it possible to take short term disability until I feel better? Is that bad? How will I explain?

Still, I am anxious that I am certifiably crazy. I am so sad. I am failing. I have a hard time sleeping lately--more and more so, because my brain is taking a while to shut down the stream of critical thoughts. I wake up early with a start, wondering where my daughter is--she's in her crib. Safe. I stay awake because my brain is telling me everything I did wrong, and making me anxious about the day ahead. The meetings where I will say something wrong. The procedures I will fuck up. The fear that my boss will finally come out and tell me she hates my work and that I'm fired. The fear that maybe my husband is fed up with my broken brain and needs to get away from me.

I am just so close to the edge, and it is taking all my will power and all the self-care time I can cobble together to stay together.

You start the day with the best of intentions (and a dash of denial) and the next thing you know you're laying on the floor trying to quickly gather your energy to clean up after dinner because you ran out of spoons and were pretending you had more but your body and brain told you otherwise by throwing on the brakes.

What is the spoon theory? I first heard about it from Jenny Lawson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Furiously-Happy-Funny-Horrible-Things/dp/1250077001" target="_blank"><em>Furiously Happy</em></a>, but it has its origins from a blog <a href="http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/" target="_blank">ButYouDontLookSick.com</a> by Christine Miserandino, a woman who has lupus. It brilliantly applies to any chronic illness, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

Christine said her friend, who has witnessed her suffer from lupus for years, still didn't understand until she came up with the Spoon Theory. My husband still has a hard time understanding. He knows I struggle, but then he unhelpfully compares it to his own problems, "I get tired, too," before admitting that he really doesn't understand.

Every morning, I need to guess how many spoons I have that day, and what the spending rate is. When my medicine is properly adjusted and I feel like I have a good handle on things, things cost fewer spoons. When I am struggling, more things cost more spoons.

<strong>Let's pretend it's a good day.</strong>

I have more spoons to begin with, and work is probably going to be easy. I might spend a spoon unloading the dishwasher, and if I am really ambitious, spend a spoon loading it. A spoon for getting ready for the day, including making lunch and even putting on eyeliner. A spoon for getting the baby ready. Her peeing the pants doesn't faze me, because I'm in a good place. A spoon for making the bus on time, daycare on time, and work on time.

An unexpected meeting with bad news takes a spoon. I spend a few more spoon at work, and come home. I still have enough spoons.

I take the dog for a walk--heck, a longer walk! Maybe to the dog park! A spoon for making a dinner. A spoon for bathing the baby and putting her to bed. A spoon for cleaning up something around the house. A cleaner house means I don't need to spend spoons on coping with the mess.

I end the day with enough spoons, and reward myself with a little crocheting or crafting before bed, which regenerates spoons.

<strong>Now here's what it's like when I have a flareup of depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD.</strong>

I spent spoons overnight for each bad or anxious dream, so I wake up realizing I have fewer spoons. I check my schedule--work should be pretty tame today. If necessary, I can assign a student to do one of my public-facing shifts to give me more time to rest and regenerate spoons. Strategizing about my spoons cost a spoon. I get up and start getting ready. Spoon. Seeing messy kitchen and realizing you need to do dishes still because you didn't have the energy to last night--another spoon. You trip over the piled up dirty clothes and realize you still haven't had the energy to do that--another spoon. You make lunch--another spoon. Getting dressed takes another spoon because choosing clothes becomes a daunting decision. Getting the baby ready is another spoon. Wait--she pooped her paints. another spoon. Cleaning up carpet is another spoon. Getting out the door on time, another spoon. Walking to bus stop, another spoon. Walking to daycare, another spoon. Walking to work, another spoon. Realizing Ive've spent double or triple your usual spoons costs another spoon, because then I'm anxious that I might run out of spoons.

I get to work and rearrange the public-facing schedule so I don't have to do as much of it. That's a spoon, but it will hopefully save me many spoons. Otherwise helping troubleshoot problems with our customers are multiple spoons. Checking on things and making manager decisions costs spoons. I'm getting worn out, already, and think ahead to the evening. I'm supposed to go up north to see a friend for dinner. Usually my husband helps, so I count on him. That's a spoon. Then I get called into a meeting with bad news. Spoon. I'm dipping into my reserves, and burst into tears even when it shouldn't make me cry. I apologize and try to pretend I'm together and don't have copious tears running down my face. I'm embarassed. That's several spoons. I spend spoons trying to gather my emotional energy after the meeting, and pretending to be normal for your employees costs more spoons.

I'm exhausted when I pick up the baby (spoon) and hop on the bus back home (spoon). Normally her wiggling doesn't bother me, but today that's another spoon. A spoon for getting off the bus. A spoon for worrying about cars or buses running into us. A spoon for getting home and thinking about walking the dog, but deciding against it.

The kitchen is still messy at home. Spoon. I need to make dinner, but I'm low on spoons, so I put a pizza in the oven. That's just one spoon, whereas if I do more dishes and healthier dinners, that's a spoon for each dish. Spoon for bathing baby. Spoon for feeding animals. Spoon for worrying about laundry. Spoon for thinking about crying at work today. Spoon for worrying about depression and anxiety. Spoon for feeling inadequate. Spoons flying out with every anxious thought.

I've been out of spoons for a while, so I take it from the next day. Spoon to put baby to bed. I fall asleep in chair, and wake up hoursl ater to realize that we need to be in bed. That's another spoon.

The next day, I'm even more tired and have had more strange dreams, so that's several spoons. Gone before I even wake up.

That's what it's like for me right now.

He knows I struggle, but then he unhelpfully compares it to his own problems, "I get tired, too," before admitting that he really doesn't understand.

Every morning, I need to guess how many spoons I have that day, and what the spending rate is. When my medicine is properly adjusted and I feel like I have a good handle on things, things cost fewer spoons. When I am struggling, more things cost more spoons.

<strong>Let's pretend it's a good day.</strong>

I have more spoons to begin with, and work is probably going to be easy. I might spend a spoon unloading the dishwasher, and if I am really ambitious, spend a spoon loading it. A spoon for getting ready for the day, including making lunch and even putting on eyeliner. A spoon for getting the baby ready. Her peeing the pants doesn't faze me, because I'm in a good place. A spoon for making the bus on time, daycare on time, and work on time.

An unexpected meeting with bad news takes a spoon. I spend a few more spoon at work, and come home. I still have enough spoons.

I take the dog for a walk--heck, a longer walk! Maybe to the dog park! A spoon for making a dinner. A spoon for bathing the baby and putting her to bed. A spoon for cleaning up something around the house. A cleaner house means I don't need to spend spoons on coping with the mess.

I end the day with enough spoons, and reward myself with a little crocheting or crafting before bed, which regenerates spoons.

<strong>Now here's what it's like when I have a flareup of depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD.</strong>

I spent spoons overnight for each bad or anxious dream, so I wake up realizing I have fewer spoons. I check my schedule--work should be pretty tame today. If necessary, I can assign a student to do one of my public-facing shifts to give me more time to rest and regenerate spoons. Strategizing about my spoons cost a spoon. I get up and start getting ready. Spoon. Seeing messy kitchen and realizing you need to do dishes still because you didn't have the energy to last night--another spoon. You trip over the piled up dirty clothes and realize you still haven't had the energy to do that--another spoon. You make lunch--another spoon. Getting dressed takes another spoon because choosing clothes becomes a daunting decision. Getting the baby ready is another spoon. Wait--she pooped her paints. another spoon. Cleaning up carpet is another spoon. Getting out the door on time, another spoon. Walking to bus stop, another spoon. Walking to daycare, another spoon. Walking to work, another spoon. Realizing Ive've spent double or triple your usual spoons costs another spoon, because then I'm anxious that I might run out of spoons.

I get to work and rearrange the public-facing schedule so I don't have to do as much of it. That's a spoon, but it will hopefully save me many spoons. Otherwise helping troubleshoot problems with our customers are multiple spoons. Checking on things and making manager decisions costs spoons. I'm getting worn out, already, and think ahead to the evening. I'm supposed to go up north to see a friend for dinner. Usually my husband helps, so I count on him. That's a spoon. Then I get called into a meeting with bad news. Spoon. I'm dipping into my reserves, and burst into tears even when it shouldn't make me cry. I apologize and try to pretend I'm together and don't have copious tears running down my face. I'm embarassed. That's several spoons. I spend spoons trying to gather my emotional energy after the meeting, and pretending to be normal for your employees costs more spoons.

I'm exhausted when I pick up the baby (spoon) and hop on the bus back home (spoon). Normally her wiggling doesn't bother me, but today that's another spoon. A spoon for getting off the bus. A spoon for worrying about cars or buses running into us. A spoon for getting home and thinking about walking the dog, but deciding against it.

The kitchen is still messy at home. Spoon. I need to make dinner, but I'm low on spoons, so I put a pizza in the oven. That's just one spoon, whereas if I do more dishes and healthier dinners, that's a spoon for each dish. Spoon for bathing baby. Spoon for feeding animals. Spoon for worrying about laundry. Spoon for thinking about crying at work today. Spoon for worrying about depression and anxiety. Spoon for feeling inadequate. Spoons flying out with every anxious thought.

I've been out of spoons for a while, so I take it from the next day. Spoon to put baby to bed. I fall asleep in chair, and wake up hoursl ater to realize that we need to be in bed. That's another spoon.

The next day, I'm even more tired and have had more strange dreams, so that's several spoons. Gone before I even wake up.

That's what it's like for me right now. I need to conserve spoons until I get this shit under control again.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"
