<strong>Guest Blog by James Papandrea, </strong>

We sometimes hear about an American work ethic, or variations on that theme, but what does that mean? The word “ethic” makes me think of morality, and implies that some work ethics are better than others…

Usually in our culture we assume that the more ambitious we are – or even the more aggressive we are - the better, and that drive gives us a better chance at success. (How we define success is a related topic, but one that will have to wait until later to explore.)

But recently I’ve seen some articles about a certain mega-company (think online retailer named after a rain forest) that drives its employees so hard that some claim it’s become a high-tech sweat shop, leaving no room for employees to have any quality of life outside of work. Is that what we strive for? Do we push ourselves so hard that we live unhealthy lives, just so that we can get a job that forces us to live unhealthy lives?

When I was in college, I had an acquaintance (a fellow musician) who told me something his father had often said when he was young. His father said this: “Just remember, every night when you go to sleep, someone else is still up practicing.” Talk about pressure. It made me grateful that my own father taught me something different. Don’t get me wrong – my dad taught me to be driven – he taught me that I could accomplish anything I wanted to, and that no one was going to do it for me. He taught me a certain work ethic with expressions like, “leave no stone unturned.” But he also taught me to put family and other people before career goals, and he showed me how to enjoy life.

I believe that we can be persistent and driven toward success, without sacrificing quality of life, as long as we keep our lives in balance. I write about that balance in my book, <b><i>Spiritual Blueprint: How We Live, Work, Love, Play, and Pray.</i></b>

But here’s something I’ve been thinking about recently – something I’ve had to admit to myself. Most of the success I’ve had in my life is due to two things: perseverance and favors. Perseverance is what I can do for myself – it means not giving up – and that requires patience. If we persevere, and “leave no stone unturned,” and if we don’t give up while we wait for the fruits of our labors to mature in their own time, we will receive the reward for our work. But favors – that’s not something I can do for myself. Favors are not something I can control. Favors are things that I have to hope other people will do for me, simply because they <i>want</i> to help me.

Much of my good fortune has been directly due to friends and colleagues helping me by introducing me to influential people or by putting in a good word with someone that opens a door for me. And for that I can take no credit – I can only be grateful.

So if we make as many friends as possible, and be the best people we can be, and if we go out of our way to do things for others, then others will want to do things for us. They will literally create opportunities for us. And it’s the combination of perseverance and favors that make things happen.

But here’s the rub – you can’t be a good friend, or be someone that other people want to be around and do favors for – if your life is out of balance. No one will want to do anything for you if you’re so driven that you become a jerk. If you allow yourself to get frustrated and lose your patience, then perseverance won’t pay off because no one will want to be around you, let alone help you.

My advice is: Don’t give up, but don’t become a jerk either. Keep your life and your priorities in balance. Make friends, and be a friend. And eventually, perseverance will combine with what some would call “karma,” and lead to increasing success.

<strong>Book Description</strong>

Through stories about everything from spirituality and parenting, self-acceptance and friendship, shopping at Old Navy and bowling with preschoolers, readers will be inspired to gently lift the lids off of their compartmentalized lives and tie together the torn and tattered pieces that lie inside in order to live more fully and connect more deeply with the people and world around them. Open Boxes is filled with stories of comfort, struggle, heartache, joy, insight, compassion, resilience, and redemption. Like a cup of coffee with a good friend, the stories will soothe and inspire, uplift and motivate, entertain and encourage.

<strong>Reviews</strong>

Gifted in the use of delightful analogies, Organ transforms even the messiest moments of everyday life into windows opening outward toward grace, wonder and miracles. --<strong>Margaret Placentra Johnston</strong>, award winning author of <i>Faith Beyond Belief: Stories of Good People Who Left Their Church Behind</i>

“I love the way Christine Organ writes with such realness and authenticity. She takes the everyday, ordinary moments of her life, and she transforms them into stories every one of us can relate to. I appreciate, too, how she doesn't avoid the messy moments, but instead, walks right through them and finds unexpected grace around the corner. Journey with Christine and find grace in the parking lot of Old Navy, wonder in quantum physics and ordinary miracles every step of the way. This is a book you will savor and delight in, and one you are sure to return to again.” –<b>Goodreads Reviewer</b>

“Open Boxes is a must read! This book encourages you to see the extraordinary in the ordinary, find grace in chaos, and encourages us all to appreciate what you have, and to try and be a better person every day, in easy and practical ways. I like to read a chapter before bed or first thing in the morning, and then reflect on it as I go about my day, and try to incorporate the lessons and be a better person, in simple ways, every day. I bought one for all of my friends for Christmas, it's a great gift and a great way to start a new year, being inspired to live a fuller and more connected life!”- <b>BarnesandNoble.com Reviewer</b>

<strong>Reviews</strong>

Gifted in the use of delightful analogies, Organ transforms even the messiest moments of everyday life into windows opening outward toward grace, wonder and miracles. --<strong>Margaret Placentra Johnston</strong>, award winning author of <i>Faith Beyond Belief: Stories of Good People Who Left Their Church Behind</i>

“I love the way Christine Organ writes with such realness and authenticity. She takes the everyday, ordinary moments of her life, and she transforms them into stories every one of us can relate to. I appreciate, too, how she doesn't avoid the messy moments, but instead, walks right through them and finds unexpected grace around the corner. Journey with Christine and find grace in the parking lot of Old Navy, wonder in quantum physics and ordinary miracles every step of the way. This is a book you will savor and delight in, and one you are sure to return to again.” –<b>Goodreads Reviewer</b>

“Open Boxes is a must read! This book encourages you to see the extraordinary in the ordinary, find grace in chaos, and encourages us all to appreciate what you have, and to try and be a better person every day, in easy and practical ways. I like to read a chapter before bed or first thing in the morning, and then reflect on it as I go about my day, and try to incorporate the lessons and be a better person, in simple ways, every day. I bought one for all of my friends for Christmas, it's a great gift and a great way to start a new year, being inspired to live a fuller and more connected life!”- <b>BarnesandNoble.com Reviewer</b>

<p dir="ltr">Kartemquin films has a history of telling compelling stories about the people who sometimes are hidden in our society. They connect with filmmakers who create lasting characters and unforgettable images .  They continue that tradition with the release of "The Homestretch".</p>
The Moving film tells story of 3 Illinois teens among the estimated 54,000 trying to survive each night in the city (20,000 in Chicago), and the estimated 1.7 million nationwide in the growing homeless youth crisis produced and directed by Anne de Mare and Kirsten Kelly, will have its theatrical premiere run at the Gene Siskel Film Center at the Art Institute of Chicago from September 12th - 18th.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shot over the course of five years with unprecedented access into the Chicago Public Schools, The Night Ministry’s The Crib emergency youth shelter, and Teen Living Programs’ Belfort House, The Homestretch follows three teens—Roque, Kasey and Anthony-- through a complex and haunting Chicago landscape of couch-hopping, emergency shelters, makeshift homes, and a school system that is struggling to cope with this crisis. In one scene, emergency shelter beds are meted out via a lottery.
<p dir="ltr">“It is our hope that, through the deeply personal journeys of Kasey, Anthony and Roque, this film can shine a much needed light on one of the most hidden and exploited populations in America – unaccompanied homeless youth,” said co-directors/producers Anne De Mare and Kirsten Kelly. “As a character says in the the film, we want people to understand that, "[Homelessness is] a situation. It's not who you are."</p>

</div>
<p dir="ltr">Many of the screenings at Gene Siskel Film Center will be co-presented by Chicago homeless services organizations at the frontlines of addressing the city’s youth homelessness crisis. The filmmakers have an ambitious audience engagement plan designed to raise local, statewide and national  awareness of the situation.The Illinois Board of Education reports that over 54,000 children and youth are currently homeless (20,000 in Chicago) and that number is rising.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A co-production of Chicago’s Kartemquin Films (makers of 2014’s most acclaimed documentary, Life Itself, about Roger Ebert) and New York’s Spargel Productions (Asparagus! Stalking the American Life), The Homestretch received high praise earlier in 2014 at Toronto’s Hot Docs International Festival, the Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York, and AFI Docs Festival in Washington DC, is now coming home for its first theatrical showings before a nationwide tour this fall and winter, and a PBS broadcast in 2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The subjects of the film will be present at multiple screenings through the week. The director/producers, editor Leslie Simmer, executive producers Justine Nagan and Gordon Quinn of Kartemquin Films, and executive producer Andrew W. Schwertfeger will attend the opening night on Friday, September 12th.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are also delighted to bring our films to our home town audience, but especially so when the subject matter is so directly focused on Chicago, “ said Justine Nagan, Kartemquin Films executive director. “The Homestretch is in the heartbreaking yet inspiring tradition of our films like The Interrupters, and will hopefully have just as much of an impact on attitudes and policy.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Filmmakers Kirsten Kelly and Anne de Mare began production on The Homestretch in 2010 after Kelly realized a young person in a theater production she was working on with Chicago Public Schools and Chicago Shakespeare Theater was homeless. Upon further investigation, they found that 19,000 kids in Chicago Public Schools were listed in the CPS homeless education program, officially titled “Students in Temporary Living Situations.” But they soon discovered that this number was not comprehensive as many teens do not want to be identified as homeless and do not ask for help. An estimated 1.6 million children and youth across the U.S. face obstacles of homelessness last year, and up to 40% of these youth identify as LGBT.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Initial funding for the film was provided by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, The Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program, Bertha Fund, Chicago Community Trust, Pierce Family Foundation, Polk Bros. Foundation and Chicken &amp; Egg Pictures, and through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Independent Television Service (ITVS)  and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s American Graduate Initiative recently signed on as Executive Producers.</p>

<div>Shot over the course of five years with unprecedented access into the Chicago Public Schools, The Night Ministry’s The Crib emergency youth shelter, and Teen Living Programs’ Belfort House, The Homestretch follows three teens—Roque, Kasey and Anthony-- through a complex and haunting Chicago landscape of couch-hopping, emergency shelters, makeshift homes, and a school system that is struggling to cope with this crisis. In one scene, emergency shelter beds are meted out via a lottery.
<p dir="ltr">“It is our hope that, through the deeply personal journeys of Kasey, Anthony and Roque, this film can shine a much needed light on one of the most hidden and exploited populations in America – unaccompanied homeless youth,” said co-directors/producers Anne De Mare and Kirsten Kelly. “As a character says in the the film, we want people to understand that, "[Homelessness is] a situation. It's not who you are."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Many of the screenings at Gene Siskel Film Center will be co-presented by Chicago homeless services organizations at the frontlines of addressing the city’s youth homelessness crisis. The filmmakers have an ambitious audience engagement plan designed to raise local, statewide and national  awareness of the situation.The Illinois Board of Education reports that over 54,000 children and youth are currently homeless (20,000 in Chicago) and that number is rising.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A co-production of Chicago’s Kartemquin Films (makers of 2014’s most acclaimed documentary, Life Itself, about Roger Ebert) and New York’s Spargel Productions (Asparagus! Stalking the American Life), The Homestretch received high praise earlier in 2014 at Toronto’s Hot Docs International Festival, the Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York, and AFI Docs Festival in Washington DC, is now coming home for its first theatrical showings before a nationwide tour this fall and winter, and a PBS broadcast in 2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The subjects of the film will be present at multiple screenings through the week. The director/producers, editor Leslie Simmer, executive producers Justine Nagan and Gordon Quinn of Kartemquin Films, and executive producer Andrew W. Schwertfeger will attend the opening night on Friday, September 12th.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are also delighted to bring our films to our home town audience, but especially so when the subject matter is so directly focused on Chicago, “ said Justine Nagan, Kartemquin Films executive director. “The Homestretch is in the heartbreaking yet inspiring tradition of our films like The Interrupters, and will hopefully have just as much of an impact on attitudes and policy.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Filmmakers Kirsten Kelly and Anne de Mare began production on The Homestretch in 2010 after Kelly realized a young person in a theater production she was working on with Chicago Public Schools and Chicago Shakespeare Theater was homeless. Upon further investigation, they found that 19,000 kids in Chicago Public Schools were listed in the CPS homeless education program, officially titled “Students in Temporary Living Situations.” But they soon discovered that this number was not comprehensive as many teens do not want to be identified as homeless and do not ask for help. An estimated 1.6 million children and youth across the U.S. face obstacles of homelessness last year, and up to 40% of these youth identify as LGBT.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Initial funding for the film was provided by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, The Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program, Bertha Fund, Chicago Community Trust, Pierce Family Foundation, Polk Bros. Foundation and Chicken &amp; Egg Pictures, and through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Independent Television Service (ITVS)  and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s American Graduate Initiative recently signed on as Executive Producers.</p>

Chris Agnello is a struggling musician and loner college student who dreads the future, lives in the past, and longs for a mentor. When his physicist sister builds a time machine that runs on music, he tries to use it to go back to the 1980's, but instead finds himself farther back in the past than he bargained for - stuck in the 1700's - on a journey of self discovery, and running for his life. To get back to his own time, he must find a way to get from Dublin to London in time to catch his ride home... but in the meantime, he might just have found his future in the past. Sci-Fi and time travel fans will love this new and unique perspective on time travel. Fans of historical fiction will love the deeply human characters, the surprising realism of their journey, and the heartwarming love story
