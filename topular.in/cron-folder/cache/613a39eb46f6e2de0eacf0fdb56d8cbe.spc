Rahm doesn't like to talk about cops, murders, junk bonds, high interest loans and schools with no resources.  Because there's no solution to any of it.  Let's talk about other stuff instead.  And so we have the following things all of a sudden that are front and center.
<ul>
	<li>A library book amnesty--bring your overdue books back to our library's empty shelves and no fine owed.  And guess who's doing the PSA? Yep, Mayor Rahm himself!  Take a look at the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-osdV-0K08" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

</ul>
All of these big ideas solve Rahm's big problem, which is an inability to govern what has become an ungovernable city.  Instead, Rahm provides distractions.  Nice ideas that we can fantasize about.  Like a nonstop train ride to O'Hare.  And calling ourselves "Hockeytown."  And kids being smoke-free and their parents being library-fine free.

Rahm, however, was elected to solve the really big problems--which he swore he could solve.

But who can argue with a mayor who says bring your books back, no questions asked, no money required--and as our shelves fill up again, take out some new ones.  (In case you don't want to watch the video above, that's what he says.)

And who can argue with reducing the number of young people who smoke? Especially if you can't keep them from shooting each other, or keep the cops from shooting them.  The interesting thing about this is how many of the aldermen are fighting him on this noble plan geared to reduce lung cancer, heart disease and yellow teeth.

A new train route to O'Hare, of course, begs the question of who gets their houses and businesses torn down to construct the new route.  And it also makes you wonder what politically connected conniver will get to invoke the government's right to eminent domain in order to run that lucrative concession.

But getting the NHL draft causes the most consternation in the end.

As far as I know, we never did find out exactly how much <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/nfldraft/ct-nfl-draft-turnout-met-20150503-story.html" target="_blank">the NFL one</a> cost us last summer.  And exactly <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mom-think-poignant/2015/06/5-things-lately-in-the-south-loop-i-dont-understand/" target="_blank">what did we get </a>out of it besides a lot of traffic, inconvenient pedestrian and vehicular detours and damage to Grant Park? Oh, I remember!  We got <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-nfl-draft-guide-20150414-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">a nice laser show</a> on the facade of <a href="http://www.spertus.edu" target="_blank">Spertus Institute</a>.  And got the name "Chicago" mentioned positively in the news a few times--along with the murder rate.  (Which isn't to say that my family members and I didn't enjoy walking through all the hoopla a time or two.)

But what's scary is <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/sports/hockey/red-wings/huh-chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-says-chicago-will-be-hockeytown" target="_blank">stealing the name Hockeytown</a> from Detroit--or Warroad, Minnesota which owns the trademark.  Depending on which one you think is entitled to the name, could the result be a lawsuit if we appropriate the moniker?

Now wouldn't that be a fabulous distraction?

Stand his ground and proceed with defending the suit?  Cave in and kill, or at least move, the museum?  Or, maybe, just maybe, talk it over with Chicago residents and community leaders to see what we think of the whole idea of stealing land and getting bogged down in a lawsuit to defend the theft--for a half-conceived museum that in the end may be an albatross around our neck?  Because it could  flop for lack of attendance, a lack of exhibits and a lack of money.  And then what?

Nope, Rahm's not going to do any of that.  Instead, he says he's going to talk things over with his pals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" target="_blank">George </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellody_Hobson" target="_blank">Mellody</a> to see what's up with them.  What do they want to do?  Not what do Chicagoans want to do, he says in a video <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/05/full-video-rahm-emanuel-says-rauner-not-showing-financial-leadership/" target="_blank">here</a>, but what do George and Mellody want to do?

That's his reaction?  Sit down with two of the richiest riches in town to see where they stand on stealing public land for themselves, and getting involved in a very expensive protracted legal battle?  What about us, Tiny Tears?  How about asking us what we think about it?

That's been the problem with this idea all along.  George Lucas, the Great Star (wars) gets his <a href="http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/04/presidio_passes_on_all_proposals_including_lucas_museum.php" target="_blank">Lucas Museum idea dissed by San Francisco</a>, his hometown, and comes to his new wife's hometown and tells Rahm (NOT US) what he's going to do on our free land, no questions asked, no compromises offered.  And Rahm says OK.

Not once did Lucas address us residents.  Not once did he humble himself. Thank us.  Consider us.  Not once.

Rahm just said, "Sure, Georgie, anything you say."

So for <a href="http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/tellingstories/" target="_blank">59 Norman Rockwells</a> (how about donating them to the <a href="http://www.artic.edu" target="_blank">Art Institute</a>, which can designate The Lucas Rockwell Room?) and a <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/about-the-museum/site-archives/about-the-museum-exhibits/archived-exhibit-detail/" target="_blank">Star Wars collection</a> (which has already been here years ago at the Museum of Science and Industry--and the day my daughter and I went no one was there but us), <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mom-think-poignant/2014/11/the-new-lucas-museum-plan-looks-like-my-apple-router-with-a-cocktail-coaster-on-it/" target="_blank">a futuristic museum building</a> and a paltry endowment, he wants to be part of <a href="http://gochicago.about.com/od/chicagomuseums/ss/museum_campus.htm" target="_blank">our Museum Campus</a>.  He wants to be part of three other museums that are conducting world-renowned research and which have been attracting crowds for decades and decades with some of the most respected collections in the world.

If not for Friends of the Parks (God bless them), lakefront ground would be broken on this egotistical lame brain idea in a few weeks.  Instead, the brakes are on--at least until the conclusion of the lawsuit.

So, George and Mellody and Rahmbo, how about this?  Consider this when you're talking together.  Mr. Lucas wants a Lucas museum in Chicago?  Go to an area with a lot of land that needs a good perk, a good draw.  And get you some of that.  Bronzeville?  Englewood?  Even <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mom-think-poignant/2013/07/tony-rezkos-62-acres-of-land-and-me/" target="_blank">the land at Clark and Roosevelt</a> that is so unused it's never had any infrastructure whatsoever. That's where your legacy should be.  Helping our city.  Not stealing from it.

Or take over the <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/7/71/565270/the-watchdogs-daleys-michael-reese-hospital-deal-still-costing-taxpayers-millions" target="_blank">Michael Reese land that is costing us a fortune every day</a>, ever since we bought it for the 2016 Olympics that will not be.  Or, as Friends of the Parks suggests, <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150929/OPINION/150929821/when-the-city-skirts-public-scrutiny-you-wind-up-with-the-lucas-museum" target="_blank">take over some very underused land on the west side of Lake Shore Drive</a> in the South Loop.  Do us a favor.  And we'll do you a favor by not filing suits or criticizing you.

Build yourself a museum.  Completely on your dime.  Pick good people to run it.  And make sure you have plenty of parking and infrastructure available.  And a traffic plan--if your dream comes true.  And buy plenty of advertising.  And make sure that your endowment covers <em>whatever</em> comes the museum's way.  That's what you should do, George.  And I hope Mellody and Rahm agree.

That's the way to go, George.  And may the force be with you.

And keep this in mind.  This may be the new Chicago Way--now that <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/01/18/too-little-too-late-from-aldermen-on-rahms-depaul-deal" target="_blank">our mayor has lost his mojo</a>.  Not only will lawsuits have to be won and lost on their merits.  So will ideas.  All of them.  Even yours.

Stand his ground and proceed with defending the suit?  Cave in and kill, or at least move, the museum?  Or, maybe, just maybe, talk it over with Chicago residents and community leaders to see what we think of the whole idea of stealing land and getting bogged down in a lawsuit to defend the theft--for a half-conceived museum that in the end may be an albatross around our neck?  Because it could  flop for lack of attendance, a lack of exhibits and a lack of money.  And then what?

Nope, Rahm's not going to do any of that.  Instead, he says he's going to talk things over with his pals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" target="_blank">George </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellody_Hobson" target="_blank">Mellody</a> to see what's up with them.  What do they want to do?  Not what do Chicagoans want to do, he says in a video <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/05/full-video-rahm-emanuel-says-rauner-not-showing-financial-leadership/" target="_blank">here</a>, but what do George and Mellody want to do?

That's his reaction?  Sit down with two of the richiest riches in town to see where they stand on stealing public land for themselves, and getting involved in a very expensive protracted legal battle?  What about us, Tiny Tears?  How about asking us what we think about it?

That's been the problem with this idea all along.  George Lucas, the Great Star (wars) gets his <a href="http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/04/presidio_passes_on_all_proposals_including_lucas_museum.php" target="_blank">Lucas Museum idea dissed by San Francisco</a>, his hometown, and comes to his new wife's hometown and tells Rahm (NOT US) what he's going to do on our free land, no questions asked, no compromises offered.  And Rahm says OK.

Not once did Lucas address us residents.  Not once did he humble himself. Thank us.  Consider us.  Not once.

Rahm just said, "Sure, Georgie, anything you say."

So for <a href="http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/tellingstories/" target="_blank">59 Norman Rockwells</a> (how about donating them to the <a href="http://www.artic.edu" target="_blank">Art Institute</a>, which can designate The Lucas Rockwell Room?) and a <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/about-the-museum/site-archives/about-the-museum-exhibits/archived-exhibit-detail/" target="_blank">Star Wars collection</a> (which has already been here years ago at the Museum of Science and Industry--and the day my daughter and I went no one was there but us), <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mom-think-poignant/2014/11/the-new-lucas-museum-plan-looks-like-my-apple-router-with-a-cocktail-coaster-on-it/" target="_blank">a futuristic museum building</a> and a paltry endowment, he wants to be part of <a href="http://gochicago.about.com/od/chicagomuseums/ss/museum_campus.htm" target="_blank">our Museum Campus</a>.  He wants to be part of three other museums that are conducting world-renowned research and which have been attracting crowds for decades and decades with some of the most respected collections in the world.

If not for Friends of the Parks (God bless them), lakefront ground would be broken on this egotistical lame brain idea in a few weeks.  Instead, the brakes are on--at least until the conclusion of the lawsuit.

So, George and Mellody and Rahmbo, how about this?  Consider this when you're talking together.  Mr. Lucas wants a Lucas museum in Chicago?  Go to an area with a lot of land that needs a good perk, a good draw.  And get you some of that.  Bronzeville?  Englewood?  Even <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mom-think-poignant/2013/07/tony-rezkos-62-acres-of-land-and-me/" target="_blank">the land at Clark and Roosevelt</a> that is so unused it's never had any infrastructure whatsoever. That's where your legacy should be.  Helping our city.  Not stealing from it.

Or take over the <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/7/71/565270/the-watchdogs-daleys-michael-reese-hospital-deal-still-costing-taxpayers-millions" target="_blank">Michael Reese land that is costing us a fortune every day</a>, ever since we bought it for the 2016 Olympics that will not be.  Or, as Friends of the Parks suggests, <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150929/OPINION/150929821/when-the-city-skirts-public-scrutiny-you-wind-up-with-the-lucas-museum" target="_blank">take over some very underused land on the west side of Lake Shore Drive</a> in the South Loop.  Do us a favor.  And we'll do you a favor by not filing suits or criticizing you.

Build yourself a museum.  Completely on your dime.  Pick good people to run it.  And make sure you have plenty of parking and infrastructure available.  And a traffic plan--if your dream comes true.  And buy plenty of advertising.  And make sure that your endowment covers <em>whatever</em> comes the museum's way.  That's what you should do, George.  And I hope Mellody and Rahm agree.

That's the way to go, George.  And may the force be with you.

And keep this in mind.  This may be the new Chicago Way--now that <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/01/18/too-little-too-late-from-aldermen-on-rahms-depaul-deal" target="_blank">our mayor has lost his mojo</a>.  Not only will lawsuits have to be won and lost on their merits.  So will ideas.  All of them.  Even yours.

First up, we have <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160101/NEWS04/160109999/city-hall-hires-connected-d-c-firm-for-justice-department-probe#utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ccb-breakingnews&amp;utm_campaign=ccb-breakingnews-20160101" target="_blank">high-priced politically connected law firms from Washington</a> that have a lot of experience going against the feds.  Rahm hired them to defend the City during the federal investigation of our police department.  He hired them on our behalf.  From what I can see, this will be an adversarial relationship:  us, represented by the big law firms, against the feds.

But aren't most of us citizens rooting for the feds?  Don't we want the feds here to report thoroughly and honestly about the problems that have taken hold through the years in the police department?  The problems that have cost us a ton of money, all of our self-respect as a city and have robbed us of security and calm.

Don't we want any wrongdoing uncovered and stopped?  Do we really want the feds hamstrung by legal motions, legal wrangling and back room legal maneuvering instigated by a high-priced law firm that, by the way, charges up to $1200 an hour for its services?  Do we want things kept secret?  And incomplete--due to legal loopholes?  Do we want to spend a fortune stopping the feds in their tracks, now that they're here to help us?

We don't.  But Rahm might.

(And, at least if he had to have a high-priced politically connected law firm, why not hire one from Chicago and keep the money at home?)

Next up, we have a fine lawyer--Dan Webb (I recently and <a href="http://www.chicagobar.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Past_Issues" target="_blank">very positively reviewed an impressive book</a> about him by US District Judge Charles Kocoras for the Chicago Bar Association magazine)--who is <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-dan-webb-third-party-review-met-20160110-story.html" target="_blank">gearing up to investigate</a>, similarly to <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1289295/watchdogs-3-koschman-cops-face-punishment-3-quit-avoid-sanctions" target="_blank">the Koschman case</a>, the City's Law Department.  At the discounted price of $295/hour (<a href="http://www.winston.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">his law firm </a>rates generally run $1335/per hour).

While I have absolutely NO doubt whatsoever in Webb's ability, I have to say this:  Webb is one of the boys, has contributed to Rahm's coffers--and I think it's possible Webb won't come up with anything other than pointing out a problem here and there that the City should rectify--and maybe a few ways to improve the department's overall functioning.  There may even be a completely clean bill of health--aside from a rogue prosecutor or two who has either already resigned or who will resign.

But will we finally find out the real reason why the Law Department fought hard like the devil to keep <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-laquan-mcdonald-chicago-police-reports-met-20151204-story.html" target="_blank">the McDonald videotape</a> under wraps?   I don't think so--but here's hoping.

Last but not least, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/24/mayor-rahm-emanuel-taps-high-profile-officer-advise-chicago-police/79263206/" target="_blank">Rahm has also hired the retired and renowned  Charles Ramsey</a> (commissioner and leader, respectively, of the police departments in Philadelphia and Washingotn, DC and who started his career as a Chicago cop) to consult and advise our department.  Ramsey turned down the job of actually heading our department, but has agreed to accept $350/hour to advise while the feds investigate.  A pretty good deal for him. He takes the big bucks while whoever ends up heading the department takes the heat.

So, let's cut to the chase, whats all this lawyering-up for?  I'd say it's for this, the thing Rahm cares most about:  himself.  To help preserve and protect the picture of himself  he wants to have and to project--to us.

Operator that he is, he thinks we're too dumb to see through it all.  I'd say he's getting a lot out of our money.  And it's all for him.

I'm not suggesting any fault on McQueary's part for not remembering everything or for ignoring anything.

Because if one tries to make an exhaustive list of our mayor's faults, mistakes, failings and downright nasty and inexcusable behavior, there isn't enough paper to do it.  There probably aren't enough gigabytes to explain it all on one computer.   And probably not enough space in any one brain to store it all.

Rahm Emanuel is a bully and he's a phony and he thinks we're all stupid. Some solid and reputable pundits are <a href="http://washingtonspectator.org/a-lout-with-clout/" target="_blank">now even calling him a sociopath</a>, without any fear of a defamation lawsuit.

Which brings me back to McQueary's fine column.  She's got the goods on the guy, there's no doubt about it.  But in the end, she blames us for the sad fact that he's still here.  She blames us for re-electing him.  We knew <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-sudden-but-well-deserved-fall-of-rahm-emanuel" target="_blank">all the horrid stuff </a>about him, she says.  And yet, we invited him back to the Fifth Floor to keep doing all the horrible stuff he does.  And, yes, he keeps doing it.  More and more and worse and worse.

I agree with her.  How could 55 percent of us have re-elected an incompetent screwball like this?  A guy who has failed at absolutely everything he's responsible for.  A guy who the entire world is now writing about in the most unflattering ways conceivable.

One main reason, I believe, aside from the outlandish lies Rahm Emanuel told about his <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/chicagos-chuy-garcia-lost-election-won-movement/" target="_blank">runoff opponent, Chuy Garcia</a>--in which one ad actually had this fine man stealing money out of people's wallets like a low-life pickpocket--is the Chicago Tribune editorial board.  McQueary's own colleagues on the editorial board gave Rahm a rousing endorsement.  Two in fact; <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-mayor-endorsement-rahm-emanuel-edit-0208-20150206-story.html" target="_blank">one in February</a> and <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-mayor-endorsement-emanuel-edit-0322-20150320-story.html?aa" target="_blank">one in March</a>.  Even though they knew all the bad.  And knew that on the other side of the Chinese wall, they had <a href="http://jimromenesko.com/2015/02/06/chicago-tribune-endorses-rahm-emanuel-after-spending-huge-sums-to-investigate-his-administration/" target="_blank">a whole staff who was getting the goods on this creep</a>.

Apparently, McQueary was unable to convince them, shoulder to shoulder, of the mistake they were making.  I don't know what goes on amongst colleagues in an editorial board meeting (even though I was married to a <a href="http://www.chicagojournal.com/blogs/07-28-2012/Rest_in_Peace_Paul_Thomas_McGrath" target="_blank">husband for 20 years </a>who at one point in his outstanding and prestigious newspaper career wrote editorials for the Chicago Sun-Times) but I can't help but wonder what went down. Did she try to dissuade her colleagues with a list like she wrote two days ago?  If she did, then shame on them.

It sure seems that she was keeping track--and that everything on her list was important to her.  Why didn't her colleagues pay it any mind?  The bottom line is that a newspaper endorsement goes a long way to convince voters of something--even if it's not in the best interests of the readers. Otherwise, why do editorial boards do it?

And therefore, the Chicago Tribune is just as guilty as we are for re-electing Rahm Emanuel.

In the end, the people listened, I believe, to McQueary's colleagues, fearing that the Tribune knew something that they didn't.  But as McQueary explains so eloquently, we <em><strong>all</strong> </em>knew what Rahm did and what Rahm was capable of. It was the editorial board that chose to ignore it all.  And they, among others, convinced us to ignore what we all knew.

We were too dumb to do anything about it.

I'm not suggesting any fault on McQueary's part for not remembering everything or for ignoring anything.

Because if one tries to make an exhaustive list of our mayor's faults, mistakes, failings and downright nasty and inexcusable behavior, there isn't enough paper to do it.  There probably aren't enough gigabytes to explain it all on one computer.   And probably not enough space in any one brain to store it all.

It's suddenly and inexplicably under new management:  the City of Chicago.

Anyone who knows anything <a href="http://www.architecture.org/architecture-chicago/buildings-of-chicago/building/clarke-house/" target="_blank">about Clarke House </a>is flummoxed. Doesn't the Rahm administration have <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-sudden-but-well-deserved-fall-of-rahm-emanuel" target="_blank">enough to worry about </a>right now?  Why does the City suddenly want to run this very historic and very complex house alone?  It's been lovingly, professionally and very meticulously managed for years by <a href="http://www.glessnerhouse.org" target="_blank">Glessner House Museum</a>, a world landmark just a stone's throw away.

Glessner provided curatorial services, spearheaded by a Clarke expert who spent her time researching, educating and preserving the home and artifacts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_B._Clarke_House" target="_blank">an award-winning way</a>.   Glessner volunteer docents (of which I'm one) provided guided tours at Clarke--which were free on Wednesdays; a small admission was charged Thursdays through Sundays.  The city provided maintenance for Clarke only.  Glessner is involved in ongoing fundraising efforts and guided by a board of directors.

In exchange, the City, which owns the house--the oldest in Chicago--provided security personnel for both houses and a donation.  The National Society of Colonial Dames in the State of Illinois <a href="http://www.chicagojournal.com/Blogs/03-28-2011/Now_it's_the_Dames" target="_blank">generously provided the period furnishings</a> for the house.  And how appreciated that was!

Why did the City Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events move in on a relationship that was so perfectly crafted over the years?

One can only speculate.

The City, which bought and restored the house and moved it to its present location at 18th and Indiana in 1977 (it became a landmark in 1970) recently said that Clarke House wasn't a priority anymore.  Resources spent toward educating school children were more of a priority than folks who wanted to tour a historic house.  And with the finances of the city in such a tremendously dismal state, priorities had to be set.

Which was odd because many, many school children visit Clarke House each year, well prepared for a hands on lesson in Chicago history by their teachers beforehand.  The school kids took special tours geared for their particular age level.  And they all went home with a deeper understanding of their city and how people lived in it when it first became a city.

So be it.

Then the City hemmed and hawed and waited until just a few weeks ago to tell Glessner House that the relationship was over.  The City would be taking over.  And that was that.  A schism.  A break-up.

Clarke is on its own now, being run by novice city employees.  Visitor hours are cut back; there will be NO weekend tours.  And all the work that was done in recent years is now in the hands of <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca.html/" target="_blank">DCASE</a>.

And if that's all there is to it, that would be the best case scenario.

But what do I really think?

At first I figured some politically-connected builder wanted the land that Clarke sits on--adjacent to a beautiful park on a lovely street.  Could they possibly be thinking of tearing down the oldest house in Chicago?  <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1142996/taxpayers-spent-8-million-move-historic-house-depaul-arena" target="_blank">Or moving it at <em><strong>great</strong></em> taxpayer expense</a> like the nearby Rees House that made room for the new DePaul basketball stadium?

Or did someone just want to buy it outright--and do whatever with it? (Selling wouldn't be the worst idea in the world as long as a preservation not-for-profit group bought it and carried on the mission.)

But now--like so much else in the city that belongs to us, the taxpayers--I think that the home may become privatized in some fashion.  In the same way the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_culturalcenter.html" target="_blank">Cultural Center</a> is.  By event planners--and everyone gets kind of pushed around these days to make way for them.

The point is that no one knows what's really going on.  This is what happens in a city that lacks transparency.  We tend to think the worst.

I just have a feeling that there's another story behind <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/clarke_house_museumtours.html" target="_blank">the bright eyes and the bushy tales</a> of those who say they'll be doing the job now.  And with the City's abysmal reputation for lacking transparency, who knows if and when we'll know what the real motivation is for the pouncing on Clarke House.

I, of course, will be watching.

Clarke is on its own now, being run by novice city employees.  Visitor hours are cut back; there will be NO weekend tours.  And all the work that was done in recent years is now in the hands of <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca.html/" target="_blank">DCASE</a>.

And if that's all there is to it, that would be the best case scenario.

But what do I really think?

At first I figured some politically-connected builder wanted the land that Clarke sits on--adjacent to a beautiful park on a lovely street.  Could they possibly be thinking of tearing down the oldest house in Chicago?  <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1142996/taxpayers-spent-8-million-move-historic-house-depaul-arena" target="_blank">Or moving it at <em><strong>great</strong></em> taxpayer expense</a> like the nearby Rees House that made room for the new DePaul basketball stadium?

Or did someone just want to buy it outright--and do whatever with it? (Selling wouldn't be the worst idea in the world as long as a preservation not-for-profit group bought it and carried on the mission.)

But now--like so much else in the city that belongs to us, the taxpayers--I think that the home may become privatized in some fashion.  In the same way the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_culturalcenter.html" target="_blank">Cultural Center</a> is.  By event planners--and everyone gets kind of pushed around these days to make way for them.

The point is that no one knows what's really going on.  This is what happens in a city that lacks transparency.  We tend to think the worst.

I just have a feeling that there's another story behind <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/clarke_house_museumtours.html" target="_blank">the bright eyes and the bushy tales</a> of those who say they'll be doing the job now.  And with the City's abysmal reputation for lacking transparency, who knows if and when we'll know what the real motivation is for the pouncing on Clarke House.

I, of course, will be watching.

I made a lot of calls during his first term for lightbulb changes.  And I got absolutely Nothing.  No Action.

The last call I made was quite recently--and it was to my new <a href="http://www.dowellforthirdward.com/alderman-dowell/" target="_blank">alderman, Pat Dowell</a>, as of the last election.  It did the trick.  About half the lights were out on both sides of the street.  I didn't talk to her personally but I was connected to a guy who sounded concerned, businesslike, professional and sober.  He was perfect.

The downed lights on my side of Roosevelt so darkened the immediate vicinity around my house that that it became dangerous.  Neighbors took different, out of the way routes home to avoid the darkness.

As the city sank into what it has become recently--a bastion of violent death, a mayor concerned with only the lowest of the low politics instead of the well-being of the citizens, and corruption coming fast and furious to beat the band--the lightbulbs on Roosevelt Road kept burning out.  It was the perfect metaphor for the reign of Mayor I-Care-Not-For-Anyone-But-Me.

As his bright and sneering star is falling, up come the lights on Roosevelt Road.  Another perfect metaphor.

We have seen the light, Tiny Heart, whether you like it or not, and the light prevails.  I don't think there's any turning back.   As we follow the light, we're gonna get our city back.  It's only a matter of time.

And a lot of people who are already here are screaming.  About everything from ugly shadows and blocked views to just plain too many people in too little space.

But is density bad?  As bad as some South Loopers have made it out to be--with turned up noses, raised voices, rolling eyes and plenty of tsk-tsks?

According to some things I've been hearing and reading lately, downtown density is good.  Really good for the core of a city.  And like it or not, the South Loop is part of the core of Chicago.  How can it be bad if families, empty nesters and young people crowd in in droves?

The first clue I had that there is something to be said for density was a few weeks ago when <a href="http://loopchicago.com" target="_blank">Chicago Loop Alliance</a> hosted a panel discussion centering on the topic.  Density is Good for the Loop--and for downtowns everywhere--the panel insisted.  You want a world-class city?  You better have a lot of diversity downtown:  of people, buildings and activities therein. And the panel seemed to have the goods to back it up.

So I perused a few articles on the subject--and they all said the same thing. You want <a href="https://lsecities.net/media/objects/articles/the-benefits-of-density/en-gb/" target="_blank">less of a carbon footprint?  Bring on the people</a>--the more the merrier will bring on terrific public transportation, less emissions and more efficiency.

Increasing the number of people per acre in a city <a href="http://www.planetizen.com/node/30970" target="_blank">goes a long way toward greening goals</a>, said others.

Density of residents <a href="http://www.citylab.com/work/2012/11/cities-denser-cores-do-better/3911/" target="_blank">increases the skills, wealth, talent, innovation, happiness, growth  and income </a>therein, the articles explain.

One caveat:  when density becomes the word in a city, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2014/jul/29/cities-density-building" target="_blank">don't leave the heavy lifting to the developers</a>.  Don't let them empty <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/provdrs/tif.html" target="_blank">the TIF-funds</a> without an infrastructure that can hold it all.  And an eye to detail overall.

I see no reason why the infrastructure of the South Loop can't hold what's coming.  And the residents and the pros <em>should</em> weigh in--and influence the aesthetics.

But that's another story.  And hopefully it will be a pretty one.

I badgered her with every question I could think of.  I mean, how many times are we told the electricity will be turned off for hours in the middle of the night?  Generally, if the electricity goes out, it just happens and you deal with it.  But how does one prepare for it? I wondered.

She didn't know the answer to anything I asked.  And she went to bed shortly before the electricity was cut off, sometime between 11 PM and midnight.

Best night's sleep she had in a long time, she told me the next day.  Nothing terrible happened.  Everything was dark, quiet, peaceful and she slept great.

Over at my house, on Friday some time after 11 PM, an eerie darkness suddenly settled upon my house, too.  Not inside my house--the house I live in at Roosevelt and State didn't need any ComEd repairs.  But outside.  Not only was there no light emanating from my friend's complex--other than a white work light off in the distance that the workers were using to perform the repairs--but as it turned out, <em>all </em>the lights on the Roosevelt Road bridge had to be turned out for the work to be performed.

And I live adjacent to the bridge.

For all practical purposes, when I turned out the lights in my house to go to sleep, my house was completely dark.  As dark as it's ever been in 21 years!

And I, too, had the best night's sleep I've had in a long, long time!

Which begs the question.  Why that night did both of us--and maybe others, too, who knows?--have the best night's sleep we've had in years?

Could the street lights outside our windows be interfering with a good night's rest?  I always thought my house was more than sufficiently dark at night when I went to bed.  But now I wonder if that's true.  Could <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/keyword/light-pollution" target="_blank">light pollution</a> be interfering on a nightly basis?

Ironically, last week I finally decided to call my alderman to complain about 20 of the scores of globes on the Roosevelt Road bridge being burnt out. The bridge is getting darker and darker, I whined, and it's dangerous and looks terrible, I said.  At this rate, the entire bridge is going to be burnt out.

Now I think maybe I spoke too soon.  Maybe that <em>should </em>happen. Maybe that should be the goal:  to let the lights on the whole bridge burn out.

Maybe the neighbors will get a chance to sleep like babies.

Not as shocked as I was the morning many years ago when I woke up and found out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/01/us/chicago-mayor-bulldozes-a-small-downtown-airport.html" target="_blank">Mayor Richie had ordered the carving up of the runways</a> and the outlawing of planes at Meigs Field--which preceded the new and improved Northerly Island by decades.  This was done to clear the sky of planes on that part of the Lakefront, so as not to worry the FAA or break their rules about tall buildings in the vicinity of an airport.  Richie's friends had been buying up all the land around Meigs for years--so they could build huge high-rises with which to rake in cash because <a href="http://chicago.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/21/chicago-2016-the-summer-olympics-that-got-away.php" target="_blank">we were going to host the 2016 Olympics</a>.

Remember that?

I was willing to accept the huge prairie that replaced the quaint little airport that politicians loved in order to get to Springfield fast; and that small town businessmen and their wives loved to park their private planes at in order to attend business meetings and shop at Marshall Field's, respectively.

The prairie with it's thin path surrounded by natural plantings was simple. And the huge empty vista from the city to the lake was unparalleled in Chicago.  It gave me quite a feeling.  Just like the first time I saw the city from <a href="http://www.homansquare.org/history/original-sears-tower/" target="_blank">the original Sears Tower </a>on Homan Avenue on the west side.  I'd never seen the city like that before.

But what we have now at Northerly Island is <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-met-0902-northerly-island-kamin-graphic-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">like an exhibit at Disneyland</a>. Enormous reddish boulders reminiscent of Mars--as conceived in the blockbuster movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/" target="_blank">"The Martian,"</a>--are piled up along the east side of the island like a fortress.  On the other side of the boulders is Lake Michigan, the city's greatest natural resource.  And the boulders totally block the view of the lake from the island.  Unless one is a giant.

You know the lake is there.  Why the designers of the this park decided to block the view is beyond me.

There is a huge concrete path that meanders around the island, surrounded by some sort of plantings that won't be ready for three to five years, and which are currently behind ugly temporary fencing.  And in the middle of the island is an artificial pond, fed by the waters of the invisible Lake Michigan.

So much for natural.  And so much for Lake Michigan.  I guess the lake is out of style now that we have <a href="http://studiogang.com" target="_blank">Studio Gang</a>.

<strong>Postscript</strong>:  Yesterday was my second attempt to visit Northerly Island since it opened several weeks ago.  Security guards blocked the way of taxpayers who wanted to visit in early October because the well-paid-by-the-City-for circuses-<a href="http://www.redmoon.org" target="_blank">Redmoon-Theater</a> was cleaning up after they deliberately built and then burned down a house the night before to celebrate the Chicago Fire.  It didn't fizzle this year <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mom-think-poignant/2014/10/the-chicago-fire-a-story-that-happened-at-roosevelt-and-state/" target="_blank">as it did on the Chicago River last year</a>, wasting the city's money--but it did send sparks toward Burnham Harbor, <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/994890/burnham-yacht-club-chicago-fire-festival" target="_blank">damaging the masts of many sailboats, as well as the patio awning at the Burnham Park Yacht Club</a>.

Why not just celebrate what we accomplished after the 1871 conflagration in Chicago?  Not the conflagration itself that killed hundreds, destroyed a city and left thousands homeless.

Taking a few minutes to peruse the photographs--old and new--in this little exhibit is time well spent.  And a fitting tribute to the history of a Chicago institution that is sometimes overlooked.
