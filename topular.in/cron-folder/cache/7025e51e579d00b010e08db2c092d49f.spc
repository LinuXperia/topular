<h3 style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">I blog. I&rsquo;ve been blogging since before there were blogs&mdash;when I and others did posts regularly on Onelist and on its predecessor (the name of that entity now escapes me, but then it&rsquo;s been a very long time ago).&nbsp; The point is, I clearly like blogging or I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing it all these years later.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Often, I&rsquo;m asked for blogging tips, by writers and others. Here are some of the general tips I often share:</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t blog because you think you&rsquo;re supposed to do it. Blog because you want to do it. Because you have something to say you believe will be useful to and benefit others. Blogging isn&rsquo;t about you. It&rsquo;s about your readers. Respect them by sharing content for them and try to never waste their time.&nbsp; Now, does that mean you can&rsquo;t share your news?&nbsp; No. But make it relevant. My point is, if you hate blogging, you will resent it and that will come through in your posts. That, you don&rsquo;t want and your readers won&rsquo;t want it, either.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Blog on a central theme. Think hard about what you want to share and why you want to share it.&nbsp; Let me share a few examples from my own blogs.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">On Writing:&nbsp; When I started writing, I didn&rsquo;t know another writer. I&rsquo;d spend days looking up the most basic things. It was frustrating. I spent years learning (still am) and began mentoring other writers. Doing a blog on writing craft, the business and writing life was the natural outgrowth of my experience. I wanted to spare other writers the frustrations I experienced. I wrote articles on writing, answered questions. I considered it a win/win because I had to stay on my toes and my readers could avoid many of the mud puddles I&rsquo;d had to stomp through. I still feel this way, so I still blog on writing.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Thinking Aloud and Penny Thoughts.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re busy, but we don&rsquo;t want our minds to turn to mush. So I started this blog to focus on a snippet of thought.&nbsp; A few lines&mdash;sometimes a single sentence.&nbsp; But a thought to ponder as you go through your day. It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s food for the mind, and often uplifting. Again, a win/win for the reader and for me.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Christians Read. Less than a decade ago, I started writing inspirational stories. Writing a blog that dealt with this aspect of life seemed natural; it reflected where my mind and heart were. But I didn&rsquo;t have the time to do a daily post in this area as well as to meet my existing commitments. Still, I didn&rsquo;t abandon the idea, I expanded it. I invited other inspirational authors to join me and made Christians Read a group blog. Its theme is on topics of interest to Christian Readers, Writers, and life as a Christian (which covers just about anything. All topics are from the perspective of one doing the best s/he can to live every day life while walking in faith.) Authors post M-F and we post our own book news (our books, conferences, workshops) on the weekends. Christians Read is posted in multiple locations and between them we have over 40,000 followers.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">I do other blogs but chose these three because of their diversity. One is short, one has longer posts. They&rsquo;re all theme-centric. One is a group blog.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Establish and maintain regular posts. Whether you post daily or once a week, or twice a week&mdash;whatever&mdash;do so routinely. On Fridays, on Tuesdays&mdash;this way, readers know to expect and when to expect your posts. Readers love fresh content. But if you post erratically, they might enjoy your posts but they&rsquo;ll miss (or forget) them because you fail to set a pattern that is established in their rhythm.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Team up!&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re new to blogging, you well might want to gather a group of like-minded authors and do a group-themed blog. This will expand your reach and theirs. It&rsquo;s a win/win, provided you stick to the blog&rsquo;s central theme and everyone does what they agree to do. You can set yourself up as Administrator and permit others to contribute and post their own posts. This does mean you&rsquo;ll be asked to assist the others now and then, but if your group is experienced, this will not be an ordeal and shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. Do a basic set of instructions and share them with the group, prepare a schedule in advance, and their calls for help will be occasional and grow to rare.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5. Make it easy for your readers. Allow your blog posts to be emailed to readers. On both my Christians Read blog and my personal blogs, far more people have the posts delivered to their email than go to the website to read. When you deliver to them, they don&rsquo;t have to remember to visit your blog to read your posts. The easier you make it for readers, the greater your odds for a successful blog. If you use an email service (like Mail Chimp or&nbsp;<a href="http://madmimi.com/">madmimi.com</a>), delivery is a snap to set-up and automate. Your mailing list is created and it is an extremely valuable asset. If you use a free blog at wordpress.com, then it will have your mailing list and you&rsquo;ll have to go through it to access your readers. That&rsquo;s not as good, but it is what I did initially on Christians Read, which is why I now have multiple lists. It&rsquo;s difficult to get readers to transfer over, so you want to avoid moves if at all possible. On wordpress.com, the service is free. On Mail Chimp or madmimi.com, the first hundred subscribers or so are free, but then you&rsquo;ll have to upgrade to a paid list.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6. I&rsquo;m going to harp on this because it&rsquo;s so important. Be mindful of your readers&rsquo; time. Whatever your theme, work to give them something of substance and value to them in your posts. In other words, give them what they need or want. A reason to read. Posts don&rsquo;t have to be long. Shorter is fine. It&rsquo;s substance not length that matters. My Thinking Aloud posts are as popular with readers as my full-length articles. (See why the thematic approach to your posts is important?)</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7. Moderate comments. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get a ton of people who are advertising their products/services on your blog. Some blogs allow for moderating non-followers and permitting followers to comment. That&rsquo;s perfect, if available.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">These are tips I&rsquo;ve shared most often. I hope they&rsquo;re of use to you. Happy blogging!</h3>

<h3>I write about mythology and archetypes, and so far I&rsquo;ve written a lot more about a few of the feminine archetypes than any of the masculine ones.</h3>
<h3>Artemis and Persephone have been my favorites lately.</h3>
<h3>One reason for that is I&rsquo;m a woman, and they feel a little more accessible to me. Another reason I&rsquo;ve spent so much time with them is that the more I write about a certain archetype, the more I learn, and the more I&rsquo;m inspired to write. So I like to really explore a specific archetype to gain as much insight as I can about it before I&rsquo;m comfortable moving on.</h3>
<h3>That&rsquo;s a little tricky, because each of the archetypes has so many layers&#8212;I could create an entire blog for Persephone or Artemis alone.</h3>
<h3>But I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</h3>
<h3>Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling Apollo tugging at my attention, so I thought I&rsquo;d go in that direction. Apollo feels a little more accessible to me than some of the other masculine archetypes. Not sure why. I mean, Apollo is all about intellect and winning, and I&rsquo;m certainly no scientist or Olympian. (Haha. Ha.)</h3>
<h3>Then it came to me.</h3>
<h3>I&rsquo;ve been going through some deep emotional healing, and spending a lot of time in meditation and reflection. Sounds nice, right? Maybe a little self indulgent? But healing only happens when there&rsquo;s a wound or a disease, and the process of healing is rarely comfortable. Even small cuts and scrapes itch something crazy while they&rsquo;re healing.</h3>
<h3>Anyone who practices meditation and reflection in any serious way knows that it can be a real pain in the ass. It brings up all kinds of wounds and shadows, and you have to look at things about yourself that you wish weren&rsquo;t there . . . and that you&rsquo;re not sure how to fix.</h3>
<h3>Most of us eventually encounter some form of self hate in this process.</h3>
<h3>It&rsquo;s natural. Human beings judge themselves. But I think that in an Apollo culture (which ours is), self-judgment can go to extreme levels.</h3>
<h3>Because Apollo has very high standards. Anytime we fall short in any way, we feel his judgment (our own judgment, that is). We move from self-judgment into self-hate.</h3>
<h3>So when I came up against this big nasty knot of self hate in my meditations, I realized it came from an intellectual place&#8212;I had seriously fallen short of my own standards. I also realized that my own standards were unattainable.</h3>
<h3>Apollo&rsquo;s standards are generally unattainable for mere mortals. You can never be as smart as he thinks you should. You can never win as much as he thinks you should.</h3>
<h3>So in an Apollo culture, we&rsquo;re kind of doomed to hold ourselves in certain levels of contempt.</h3>
<h3>*</h3>
<h3>Let&rsquo;s talk about Apollo&rsquo;s obsessions with perfection, and why he&rsquo;s such an influence in our world right now.</h3>
<h3>Apollo represents the power of the mind and the glory of achievement.</h3>
<h3>He is logical and methodical.</h3>
<h3>He&rsquo;s an amazing god. Look at all the stuff the intellect has allowed us to build and do in the world. We&rsquo;ve created a vast, global network of cities. With skyscrapers and very very fast trains. We&rsquo;ve created the internet, allowing for instant connection (well, theoretically) with people across the globe. We&rsquo;ve been to the moon and are exploring the vast reaches of outer space with technology. We&rsquo;ve cured diseases that used to plague humankind (good lord, I can&rsquo;t stop the puns). We&rsquo;ve genetically engineered papayas so a nasty papaya virus won&rsquo;t be able to attack them.</h3>
<h3>That is all Apollo in action.</h3>
<h3>He is the god of just about everything. As <a title="Greek Gods and Goddesses" href="http://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/gods/apollo/" target="_blank">GreekGodsAndGoddesses.com</a> explains:</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;Apollo is one of the most complex and important gods, and is the god of many things, including: music, poetry, art, oracles, archery, plague, medicine, the sun, light, and knowledge.&rdquo;</h3>
<h3>He is also the god of law, order, and justice. And being the god of &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; means he is basically the god of anything you can learn, and of the process of learning itself. Apollo has the ability to break just about anything down into a science, and to master it.</h3>
<h3>He. Is. F&#8212;-king. Brilliant.</h3>
<h3>And. He. F&#8212;king. Knows. It.</h3>
<h3>And he likes to show it.</h3>
<h3>Being the archetypal overachieving genius, Apollo has a real lack of respect for anything that is not intellectual.</h3>
<h3>He can do music, poetry, and art&#8212;all those can be broken down into component parts (remember the Greeks had measured their sculptures and arts into perfect &ldquo;divine proportions&rdquo;), and the arts are also considered important aspects of civilization, which Apollo is responsible for.</h3>
<h3>He can even do prophecy, although he wouldn&rsquo;t base it on intuition. I think that for Apollo, divination is more about looking into the mind of a man and forecasting what he&rsquo;ll do or where he&rsquo;ll go, all based on who and where he is. In that case, it&rsquo;s like Apollo&rsquo;s looking at a map and pointing out where the road you&rsquo;re on goes to. It&rsquo;s just logical. (You could do this kind of divination yourself . . . if you&rsquo;d just KNOW THYSELF.)</h3>
<h3>But if something is superstitious or can&rsquo;t be measured . . . Apollo sneers at it.</h3>
<h3>Intuition? SNEER.</h3>
<h3>Emotion? SNEER.</h3>
<h3>Apollo may be the god of many things, but the intellect can&rsquo;t actually FEEL. It can analyze feelings, but the act and art of feeling itself is done by the heart. That&rsquo;s a different archetype.</h3>
<h3>You can see this in action with some of our most popular Apollo characters today&#8212;Spock and Sherlock Holmes. They&rsquo;re both super-geniuses who prize logic and reason, they&rsquo;re both the smartest guys in any room they enter, and they are both proudly unemotional. (They both play music too, incidentally.)</h3>
<h3>So: Apollo sees himself as better than everyone else around him. It makes sense. I mean, if you&rsquo;re a super-genius surrounded by mere mortals of less than Apollonian intelligence . . . you&rsquo;re not really going to enjoy smalltalk at parties.</h3>
<h3>So most of the time Apollo pretty much keeps to himself. This is from <a title="Men-Myths-Minds" href="http://www.men-myths-minds.com/Apollo-greek-god.html" target="_blank">Men-Myths-Minds</a>:</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;[Apollo did not like] any violation of the boundaries between the gods and mortal men. Alone among the Olympian deities, Apollo never &ldquo;sponsored&rdquo; or helped any of the Greek heroes because he felt that they should know their &ldquo;place&rdquo; and stay out of the god&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</h3>
<h3>See? You really are not good enough for him.</h3>
<h3>Especially when you betray your own stupidity, which is actually very profound and deep, or when you fail to achieve things.</h3>
<h3>Apollo, the intellect, can be MERCILESS when he does not win. Again, Men-Myths-Minds:</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;It is a good thing that Apollo usually won, for he was far from being a &ldquo;good loser&rdquo;. His opponents were often punished for winning. He literally took the skin off a satyr named Marsyus who had the audacity to beat him in a music competition.&rdquo;</h3>
<h3>Your own shortcomings and failures are deeply, cruelly condemned by your own intellect.</h3>
<h3>But you, mere mortal, could never live up to Apollonian standards no matter how hard you try.</h3>
<h3>So you have always been damned to incite the condemnation of your own intellect.</h3>
<h3>*</h3>
<h3>Ours is an Apollo culture.</h3>
<h3>We are obsessed with progress, the power of our minds to master nature, build civilizations, advance technology, and to break everything down into its component parts so we can understand it and use it for our own ends.</h3>
<h3>Along with this Apollonian streak of self obsessed intellectual prowess comes a heavy helping of perfectionism.</h3>
<h3>Then comes our failure as mere mortals to live up to our own godly standards.</h3>
<h3>This starts in the intellect&#8212;the ego.</h3>
<h3>When we are babies, before the ego and intellect really begins to develop, we never judge ourselves. But as we develop a sense of personal identity and try to find where we fit in society, we learn that there are certain aspects of ourselves, and certain behaviors, that are unacceptable, and therefore unloveable and unworthy.</h3>
<h3>We learn to judge ourselves.</h3>
<h3>I will never forget the first time I saw my little niece, at three years old, express self judgment to the point that she turned against herself. She spilled her cup of milk, burst into tears, and exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing everything wrong!&rdquo; My heart broke open. How could I explain to her that, while it was true she could have been more careful and she wouldn&rsquo;t have spilled her milk, that it was okay she had made a mistake? Or that it was okay if she made that same mistake again and again? (She did.)</h3>
<h3>It wasn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;d seen her cry because she was punished, but it was the first time I&rsquo;d seen her cry because she&rsquo;d punished herself&#8212;because she thought she wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</h3>
<h3>Incidents like that demonstrate when the process of judging ourselves begins, but as we grow, so do the ways we fall short, and so do the ways we judge ourselves. We learn to judge ourselves in deeper, harsher ways, and it evolves into self hate.</h3>
<h3>*</h3>
<h3>The intellect is very hard on itself.</h3>
<h3>Apollo is a hard god.</h3>
<h3>But.</h3>
<h3>He is not really a cruel one.</h3>
<h3>The intellect, it turns out, is capable of learning . . . even about itself. It is capable of Knowing Itself.</h3>
<h3>So we come back to meditation and reflection.</h3>
<h3>Given the right impetus, and space to think, the intellect is capable of understanding the ways in which it has turned against itself, and it is capable of turning toward healing.</h3>
<h3>(Apollo is also the god of healing, remember.)</h3>
<h3>If the intellect can see how demanding perfection has wounded it and held it back, then the intellect can stop engaging in those behaviors.</h3>
<h3>So does Apollo become merciful? Less demanding? Less perfectionist?</h3>
<h3>I don&rsquo;t think so.</h3>
<h3>Apollo will never sacrifice perfection.</h3>
<h3>What he will do is redefine perfection for himself. He will create a definition of perfection that includes &ldquo;balance&rdquo; and &ldquo;patience&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsiveness.&rdquo; After all, one of Apollo&rsquo;s mottos is &ldquo;Nothing in Excess.&rdquo;</h3>
<h3>Apollo is a wonderful and unique archetype with the ability to heal himself. It may feel like your mind is your enemy (and I hear this repeated a lot in spiritual groups, especially those focused on certain kinds of meditation), but it really is not. The more conscious the mind becomes, the more it becomes a tool for its own healing.</h3>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">On February 26, 1936, a group of young Imperial Japan Army officers led a violent coup against the Japanese government in an attempt to restore absolute power for the monarchy.</span></h3>
<h3>From a Western point of view, the coup appeared to be an effort to install military rule over civil authority. That was, indeed, one of the goals of the coup leaders and supporters, but they also intended to murder or remove senior army officers from rival military factions.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">In the decade leading up to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, most Western diplomats viewed the internal politics of Japan as being a rivalry between a &ldquo;Peace Faction&rdquo; and a &ldquo;War Faction.&rdquo;</span></h3>
<h3>The reality was quite different. The actual &ldquo;Peace Faction&rdquo; in Japan was quite small and lacked significant power. The actual &ldquo;War Faction,&rdquo; the real power in Japan, was a variety of military factions and supporting wealthy industrialists.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The principal military faction consisted of senior military officers that were aligned with Japan&rsquo;s growing industrial giants.</span></h3>
<h3>They wanted to pursue a thorough physical modernization of the Japanese Army and Navy prior to conducting any wars against Western nations. At the time, they were concerned with building an Army to defeat the Soviet Union and conquer vast areas of eastern USSR and eastern China, and their basic intent was to defeat communism before communism could destroy Japan.</h3>
<h3>This principal military faction, as well as other factions, believed that sufficient oil, iron, and coal for Japan&rsquo;s industry and war machine could be obtained from the conquered areas of China, Korea, and the USSR. However, while large quantities of steel were produced in the Japanese-occupied areas of China, Japan failed to locate and develop any significant new oil fields from their territories on the Asian mainland. Oil, then as now, remained a critical factor in political decisions.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The coup leaders believed the Japanese military did not need more modernization, and they didn&rsquo;t like the influence the wealthy industrialists held over the Emperor. They viewed Emperor Hirohito as the victim of these industrialists, and they naively believed they needed to rescue him from them, as well as from the corrupt politicians and military officers.</span></h3>
<h3>By February 22, the eight principle coup leaders had managed to recruit eighteen more young officers. They began to finalize their plans. The coup leaders dubbed themselves &ldquo;The Righteous Army.&rdquo; They mobilized over 1,400 soldiers under their command. Most of the soldiers were ignorant of any conspiracy and were told simply that they had been called out to defend the Emperor from unspecified conspirators.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">In the early morning hours of February 26, the coup leaders divided their 1,400 troops into six groups. At 5:00 a.m., they conducted simultaneous attacks on the Prime Minister&rsquo;s residence, the Tokyo police headquarters, the War Ministry, and the homes of three prominent politicians.</span></h3>
<h3>The attack on the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Palace succeeded in capturing the palace. The attackers murdered the Prime Minister&rsquo;s brother-in-law, mistakenly identifying him as the Prime Minister, which left them unaware that the Prime Minister escaped. The attack on the Police headquarters succeeded, as well, but due to lack of proper preparations, the other four attacks on political targets failed.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The entire conspiracy was based on the notion that the conspirators would rescue the Emperor from the corrupt industrialists and their military lackeys.</span></h3>
<h3>Unfortunately for them, the conspirators failed to understand that Emperor Hirohito felt no need to be rescued by the Righteous Army or any other faction. In spite of popular perceptions, the Emperor agreed with the aims of the industrialists and the military modernists. He was also being well compensated financially by the new industries being built in Japanese-occupied Manchuria and Korea.</h3>
<h3>The conspirators gained entrance to the Royal Palace grounds by posing as a relief force. Once the subterfuge of the young officers leading the &ldquo;relief troops&rdquo; was discovered, they were expelled. The Emperor subsequently instructed his staff to issue a proclamation denouncing the coup.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The Emperor&rsquo;s staff wisely made that proclamation vague, and the conspiracy leaders mistook it as a declaration that they had been victorious.</span></h3>
<h3>It took an additional three days to convince them to stand down and return to their barracks. When they finally abandoned the captured grounds of the Police headquarters and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Palace, the officers and over a hundred co-conspirators were arrested. Nineteen of the officers were executed, and three others committed suicide.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The coup itself was dramatic enough, but the aftereffects were even more dramatic.</span></h3>
<h3>The military underwent a reorganization that left the modernist &ldquo;pro-war&rdquo; faction in control of the Army and Navy. The civil government ended up under tighter military control. Anyone in the government or military that even vaguely resembled anything like a peace supporter was assassinated or marginalized.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Japan was already at war with China, and the path toward expanding and escalating that war now shone more brightly than ever.</span></h3>
<h3>The civilian influence over government policy dwindled after the coup attempt, while the most aggressive military expansionists used the reorganization to consolidate their power and further their agendas, shaking out anything like a peace faction. The only question that remained was whether Japan should secure oil by capturing the Western USSR or by striking south and capturing Borneo and Sumatra.</h3>
<h3>In May of 1939, a force of 35,000 Japanese attempted to capture part of eastern Mongolia. The Japanese underestimated the Soviet commitment to defending their Mongolian allies. By September, 65,000 Mongolian and Soviet troops had expelled the Japanese. In the aftermath, the Japanese commanders in Tokyo decided that it would be best to capture and secure oil, tin, and rubber sources in the southwest Pacific region before building up forces in northwest Manchuria for a major assault against the USSR.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Planning for a surprise attack on US Naval forces in Pearl Harbor, the conquest of the Philippines, and the conquests of Borneo and Sumatra now began in earnest.</span></h3>
<h3>In the summer of 1941, when the German Army invaded the USSR, its early successes confirmed for the Japanese the wisdom of first striking southward. They were certain that the Germans would prevent the USSR from causing any trouble in Japan while Japan swept up the valuable resource areas of the Southwest Pacific.</h3>
<h3>The Japanese were right about the USSR being busy with the German invasion, but they grossly underestimated the determination and ability of the US to mobilize vast military forces to defeat them in the Pacific. That miscalculation was not fully understood until August of 1945, when Tokyo lay in ruins, and nuclear weapons had been dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</h3>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">On May 3, 1947, Japan adopted a modern democratic constitution, formally ending its era of military dominance over its government. In the final chapter of the struggle for control over modern Japan, the &ldquo;war factions&rdquo; were brought to their knees, and the small and previously powerless &ldquo;peace faction&rdquo; had the last word.</span></h3>

<p>Chocolate is practically a religious experience for my husband&#8217;s family, especially dark chocolate. See&#8217;s Dark Nuts &amp; Chews, dark chocolate bars from Trader Joe&#8217;s, and the ever-popular Dove Dark Chocolate Promises. These rich, dark delights elicit the kind of smiles and moans usually reserved for a romantic getaway.</p>
<p>When my mother-in-law passed away a few years back, we did the usual life-sorting that accompanies death, only this time there was a steady stream of &#8220;presents&#8221; involved.</p>
<p>We found a two <em>pound</em> box of See&#8217;s in the china cabinet, two bags of Dove in the pantry and several more packages in the freezer. There were other &#8220;goody stash&#8221; locations through the rest of the house too and it seemed like chocolate just kept popping up whenever we needed a fix.</p>
<p>I was&nbsp;tentative about buying chocolate for the first year after her death because:</p>
<ol>
<li>We <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t need any more</li>
<li>I was afraid it would make my honey sad</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://socialinindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dovedarkchoc.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1037 alignright" title="DoveDarkChoc" src="http://socialinindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/dovedarkchoc.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="186" /></a>One night, in anticipation of a Friday night romantic evening,&nbsp;I bought a bag of Dove Dark Chocolate Promises &#8211; little 1 ounce foil wrapped squares of chocolate. I&#8217;m kind of a minimalist when it comes to sweets. Not because I&#8217;m so virtuous, but because too much of it makes me feel ill. So usually, at dessert time, my Honey is outpacing me by a mile.</p>
<p>I unwrapped my first little foil and saw the following words printed on the inside:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The more you praise and celebrate your life,</strong> <br /><strong>the more there is in life to celebrate.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Ooooh.</em> I handed it across the table and said, &#8220;Check this out!&#8221; <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">We both agreed that the message was extremely high on the Blog Zen scale.</span></p>
<p>When his next foil said, <em>&#8220;Ignite your sense of adventure</em>.&#8221; We&nbsp;HAD to start pulling the old Chinese Fortune Cookie trick and adding &#8220;in bed&#8221; to the end of every message.</p>
<p>(Remember, there was wine involved in this dinner. We&#8217;d moved to a lovely Zinfandel port by the time we got to the chocolate so most things were funny.)</p>
<p>I had to stop a few foils in but I&nbsp;kept picking&nbsp;winner chocolates. My second foil said: <em>Take a deep breath &amp; exhale. </em> My third and final said:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others</strong> <br /><strong>cannot keep it from themselves.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>My husband&#8217;s next few were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stop and enjoy the chocolate aroma.</strong> <br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span> <br /></em><strong>Don&#8217;t settle for a spark&#8230;light a fire instead.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">An interesting trend was that all my chocolate messages were extremely high on the Blog Zen scale and his all worked amazing with &#8220;in bed&#8221; added to the end. Coincidence or no??</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">27 FOILS LATER&#8230;.(Yes, really. I counted them the next morning in anticipation of writing a post.) [<span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>I <em>told</em> you. Chocolate Freaks.</strong><span style="color: #333333;" data-mce-mark="1">]</span></span> We were convinced that Chocolate Philosophy exists, even if it takes 27 squares of Dove and at least a bottle of wine to get to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you think? Do you ever incorporate little everyday things like fortune cookies, trivia napkins and chocolate wrappers into your life philosophy?

<h3>Into every life, lemon juice does pour.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re lucky, you learn to love lemonade. I&rsquo;m lucky. And it&rsquo;s a good thing because&hellip;</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>I was having a pitcher-full and a truth about life and lemonade settled in:&nbsp; Loving lemonade is a choice.&nbsp; I mean, we can&rsquo;t avoid lemon juice any more than we can avoid challenges. We can fight it, but we are going to lose. Lemon juice will be poured; it&rsquo;s inevitable. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be bitter. We can make a different choice. Sprinkle in a little sugar or Splenda, so to speak, a little water, and we&rsquo;ve got lemonade, which tastes quite good and, on a hot day, it&rsquo;s amazingly refreshing.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>So I got juiced. I was at this crossroad in my life, debating which way to go, and this lemonade truth kept stealing my attention. I refilled my glass with half-a-pitcher to go, and another thought came to mind.&nbsp; We have a choice. When life throws us lemons, we can choose to make lemonade, or not. Another thought chased that one:</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><em>What if we couldn&rsquo;t?</em></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>What if we didn&rsquo;t have a choice. Or the choice wasn&rsquo;t ours to make. We&rsquo;d be stuck. Literally swimming in lemon juice without lemonade or a solution or resolution in sight!</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>I didn&rsquo;t care for the feeling, and it shot holes in my theory that I had at least a little control in my life. Don&rsquo;t you hate it when that happens?&nbsp; When your illusions are shattered and as leaky as a sieve?</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>I more than didn&rsquo;t like it, I hated it&hellip;but I was intrigued. So I thought about it.&nbsp; Okay, so you have not a pitcher full of lemon juice but a barrel full. You&rsquo;re already banged up.&nbsp; (Can anyone get to adulthood in life without getting banged up?&nbsp; Unlikely.&nbsp; Rare, even.) So you&rsquo;re chugging lemon juice from the barrel, eager to drain it and get the nastiness behind you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve deciphered your problems and have progressed to looking for solutions, and you&rsquo;re feeling good about that because, while the bad stuff isn&rsquo;t behind you yet, you&rsquo;ve made progress.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re on your way to getting rid of it.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Only you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;ve wracked your brain and there just are no solutions. Not even one. Worse, not only have you been robbed of a solution, your choice in what to do has been stolen, too.&nbsp; <em>Now what?&nbsp; What do you do?</em></h3>
<h3><em>&nbsp;</em></h3>
<h3>That was the situation I found myself in that led me to write the Seascape novels, and <strong><em>Beyond the Misty Shore</em></strong>specifically.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Being stuck doesn&rsquo;t exactly inspire you to be in the most receptive frame of mind. Sunshine is arrogant when you&rsquo;re grieving, right? But isn&rsquo;t it true that the worst possible time is always when important things happen? When life-changing things happen?</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>That&rsquo;s been true in my life, and so I made it true in TJ MacGregor&rsquo;s life, too.&nbsp; He is the hero stuck at Seascape Inn in Beyond the Misty Shore.&nbsp; Add more lemon juice in the form of Maggie Wright, a woman who loves to hate him, and Miss Hattie, the wise Seascape innkeeper (who seems to know <em>everything</em> about everything but won&rsquo;t just tell anyone anything because &ldquo;some things are best learned firsthand&rdquo;), a colorful cast of local characters, Maine cliffs, and a little otherworldly intervention, and, well, T.J. has his work cut out for him, doesn&rsquo;t he?</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>He did, and so did I. But don&rsquo;t feel too bad for him.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all tasted the tart of the juice and, you know, sometimes when we&rsquo;re broken, we have to <em>really</em> hurt to ever get beyond the pain. We have to figure out that we can heal before we do heal.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Eventually, we get it. And when we do, magic happens. We no longer just survive. We truly live.</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Like you and me, he&rsquo;ll figure it out&hellip; eventually. So will Maggie.&nbsp; And what fun to watch without personally sucking lemons!</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>I&rsquo;m getting a little misty here. I think I&rsquo;ll pack a bag and go visit Seascape Inn again . . . just as soon as I finish this glass of lemonade.&nbsp; Care to join me?</h3>

<h3>A lot of fairy tales I was told as a child were centered around the hero&rsquo;s mission to rescue the maiden as pretty much the entire plot structure. Or at least the whole point of the story.</h3>
<h3>On an archetypal level, sometimes it&rsquo;s appropriate, and even important, for the hero to rescue the maiden. It can represent a liberation (either of himself, of herself, or of love) that could not happen without the rescue. It can represent a unification of masculine and feminine, and overall psychic integration.</h3>
<h3>Most of us were raised on myths and fairy tales like this. They seem wholesome and moral. They&rsquo;re supposed to teach us about how love conquers all, and how true heroes stand up for ladies, and how true ladies . . . well, I guess true ladies just kind of wait around or go to sleep and hope to be rescued.</h3>
<h3>But in the case of Persephone, rescuing the maiden would be the exact wrong thing to do.</h3>
<h3>I&rsquo;ve written a lot about Persephone&rsquo;s story. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from another piece I did, so you don&rsquo;t have to go hunting around. <a title="50 Shades of Persephone and Hades" href="http://mythraeum.com/myth-movie-50-shades-persephone-hades" target="_blank">It compares Persephone&rsquo;s story to Twilight</a>:</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">When Persephone was a girl, her name was Kora. That&rsquo;s important because this story is about transformation.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Kora is a maiden with no sexual experience. She&rsquo;s a mama&rsquo;s girl. She has no sense of personal power and doesn&rsquo;t know how to set healthy boundaries. She&rsquo;s not sexual herself, but every man wants her. Kind of like when Bella went to Forks and was suddenly The Girl Everyone Wanted to Take to Prom.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Hades <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">shuns daylight</span> is the god of the Underworld, and he&rsquo;s rich. Very rich. This is symbolic of the personal treasures you can find if you have the courage to journey to your unconscious. [The Underworld symbolizes the unconscious mind in myths and archetypes.]</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">But Hades is kind of a recluse and he&rsquo;s lonely. Nobody wants to go to the Underworld on vacation, right? And he&rsquo;s a real bitch about getting his way all the time.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">He stalks Kora for a little while, because the God of the Underworld can&rsquo;t help but be creepy, before abducting her and dragging her to his kingdom. She screams, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; She struggles. But Hades doesn&rsquo;t let her go, and he doesn&rsquo;t stop when she uses the safeword. He abuses and assaults her.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Hades actively wants to hurt Kora. He makes no bones about this.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">(In some versions of the story, Kora is traumatized and powerless. In other versions, she&rsquo;s into this.)</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Hades almost kills her.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Almost.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">He feeds her <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">vampire blood</span> a pomegranate seed. And it&rsquo;s just enough nourishment for Kora, lying near-dead and broken <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">on Dr. Cullen&rsquo;s table</span> in a pit in the Underworld, to begin to revive. And as she revives, she is not the same girl who was abducted.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Hades sees that the woman rising is not the same person as the girl who went down, and he literally can&rsquo;t abuse her anymore. It&rsquo;s not possible. She is no longer the powerless creature that he could dominate. She has changed, grown, and there is no possible way to put her back the way she was.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">This is when she changes her name to Persephone.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">It doesn&rsquo;t take long for Hades to realize that he LIKES HER MORE NOW.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Once Kora changes into Persephone, Hades is no longer interested in hurting her. Not that he could, anyway. She is his equal. He thought he wouldn&rsquo;t like her this way . . . but he does.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Once Bella is a vampire, Edward&rsquo;s no longer interested in hurting her. (Not that he could.) He thought he didn&rsquo;t want her to be a vampire . . . but he likes her more this way.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">So Persephone is now every bit as badass as Hades. She sees that just as she has transformed, so has he, and they develop a mutual respect and love for each other. They can now rule side by side as King and Queen of the Underworld.</h3>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Kora&rsquo;s descent into the Underworld, where she transforms into Persephone, is symbolic of the powerless feminine being transformed by the masculine into a powerful goddess who can call herself Queen of the Underworld&#8212;and who can master all the monsters in that place&#8212;and rule as the god&rsquo;s equal.</h3>
<h3>So that&rsquo;s the recap.</h3>
<h3>In our culture&rsquo;s stories, maidens like Persephone who are abducted by the force of darkness are usually in need of rescuing. Either that, or we romanticize the monster that abducts her, so he&rsquo;s not the force of darkness.</h3>
<h3>Edward Cullen, Christian Grey, and the Beast (in Beauty in the Beast) are all romanticized versions of Hades.</h3>
<h3>So we don&rsquo;t see those fairy tale heroines, all versions of Persephone, as in need of rescue, because those are stories about love and we know she&rsquo;s in for a reward if she can tough out the scary parts.</h3>
<h3>When we tell stories about maidens who are really, truly abducted by darkness, we want them to be rescued.</h3>
<h3>As in the movie Legend (1985) with Tom Cruise and Tim Curry.</h3>
<h3>In this movie, the sweet maiden Lili is abducted by Darkness (I think that&rsquo;s actually the character&rsquo;s name) and dragged to the Underworld, there to be his Queen. It&rsquo;s Jack&rsquo;s job (Tom Cruise) to rescue her. (You totally have to watch this movie, if only to see baby Tom Cruise in hilarious Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy gear. It&rsquo;s pretty epic.)</h3>
<h3>This movie seems to have a lot of similarities to Persephone&rsquo;s story . . . at first. The overall theme is very different. I would almost say diametrically opposed.</h3>
<h3>Because in Legend, Lili is not intended to embrace Darkness and become a more powerful version of herself.</h3>
<h3>Instead, Lili&rsquo;s sweetness and innocence are values that must be saved from corruption.</h3>
<h3>Let&rsquo;s check out a few clips.</h3>
<h3>In this one, Lili is seduced by her darker half. Just like Kora would be seduced by the Persephone version of herself in the Underworld. (This is Black Swan style stuff&#8212;all about facing and embracing the darkness within.)</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWuToQn9VH4 <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWuToQn9VH4" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe> &nbsp;</p>
<h3>And this is a fun one where we see Darkness (Tim Curry) trying to seduce Lili.</h3>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksk7wPX-MI4 <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ksk7wPX-MI4" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe> &nbsp;</p>
<h3>So those clips are fun and they illustrate parts of the myth really well, but overall, I do not like this moralistic myth.</h3>
<h3>I do not like that the girl&rsquo;s innocence is valued over her power.</h3>
<h3>But, I can hear my mother asking, why does her power have to come from the darkness? Why can&rsquo;t her power be her innocence? Well, the movie is trying to tell us that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on. But innocence and naivet&eacute; is not strength for a full-grown woman. And the &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; is the source of her power because it represents the unconscious mind, facing fears, overcoming danger, and finding one&rsquo;s strength.</h3>
<h3>So that&rsquo;s why, mom.</h3>
<h3>And I do not like that this is ignored or discounted in many of our modern stories.</h3>
<h3>In Legend, Lili makes the decision to turn against Darkness, but ultimately Jack is the hero who rescues her. I do not like this. The moral of the movie would say it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s choosing to be a good person, and that her goodness blesses the land and makes it a beautiful, good place with unicorns and fairies. (Literally. There are freaking unicorns and fairies.) But I do not like that in turning against Darkness and being rescued, she sacrifices her personal power in order to live in a fairy tale land where nothing bad ever happens.</h3>
<h3>I do not like that the story demonizes Darkness, and makes it something to be defeated, instead of an intrinsic part of the Universe, and of ourselves, that can offer us great personal understanding and strength if we face and embrace it.</h3>
<p>*</p>
<h3>Joseph Campbell wrote in several places about how the myths of the Christian world (and the other Abrahamic religions) differ from the myths of the Eastern religions. Our different myths reveal different ways of thinking, approaching the world, and understanding ourselves and our place in the world.</h3>
<h3>Christianity and Western religions have a dualistic view of the Universe. There is God and there is the Devil. There is good and there is bad. There is right and there is wrong. If we are to be close to God, we must choose all that is good&#8212;we must shun darkness and sin and be good little girls and boys.</h3>
<h3>We must value innocence and purity and goodness above knowledge, and certainly above our experience of ourselves as fully integrated beings with light and dark aspects.</h3>
<h3>In this worldview, when we face the darkness, it is only to have courage and overcome it. Everything unpleasant and dark is not meant to be understood, but only overcome. It is not a source of understanding, but only of danger.</h3>
<h3>Even death, which must be avoided and feared in this worldview, will eventually be overcome as we are born to eternal life.</h3>
<h3>God and the Devil, good and bad, are constantly at odds in the world, and in an individual soul. The war is neverending.</h3>
<p>*</p>
<h3>In Eastern religions and ways of thinking, such as Buddhism and Taoism, there&rsquo;s the idea that light and dark are not at odds. They are instead complementary opposites.</h3>
<h3>Campbell points out that this is a much healthier, life-affirming way to approach the world. Why? Because it doesn&rsquo;t demonize an entire half of the universe. It doesn&rsquo;t demonize the black side of the yin-yang, and it doesn&rsquo;t demonize the Underworld&#8212;the unconscious mind.</h3>
<h3>It doesn&rsquo;t demonize the dark impulses within ourselves, or say we have to deny them. Really&#8212;does denial ever make something go away? No. Because your shadow is a part of you and you cannot carve it out. The only way to transform it is to face it, stop running from it, and understand it. Shed light on it. Doing this can often feel like &ldquo;inviting the shadow in,&rdquo; or embracing it.</h3>
<h3>Does embracing our shadow mean we let the darkness in us run wild and send the world into anarchy?</h3>
<h3>Uh, no.</h3>
<h3>It means that we embrace our shadow, and we own it&#8212;and by owning it, we&rsquo;re able to make decisions as whole beings (instead of as beings who are determined to only be one-sided).</h3>
<h3>If we don&rsquo;t own our shadow, we say it&rsquo;s not a part of us . . . but instead of going away, our shadow takes on a life of its own. (If your shadow takes on a life of its own, no wonder you think it&rsquo;s the Devil! No wonder you think you have to fight it!)</h3>
<h3>Much better, I think, to face that shadow and embrace it to become a stronger person.</h3>
<p>*</p>
<h3>Persephone is a goddess who embraces this unified world where life and death are opposites, but also one and the same. She is both the Goddess of Spring and New Life, and the Goddess of Death and Queen of the Underworld.</h3>
<h3>She has not only faced her darkness and overcome it, she has embraced it. She has not only eaten the forbidden fruit (a pomegranate), she has savored it. She has not only descended into &ldquo;Hell,&rdquo; she loves Hades (who we may see as the Devil, though he is not the Devil).</h3>
<h3>She is not a figure the Christian world could easily embrace.</h3>
<h3>When we rescue the maiden Kora, we&rsquo;re denying her the opportunity (which is really her right) to transform into the mighty goddess Persephone. We&rsquo;re denying her the right to face her shadow, and we&rsquo;re trying to keep her small and one-sided.</h3>
<h3>We&rsquo;re valuing spring more than death/transformation. Consciousness more than unconsciousness. Being good over being strong. Childlike innocence more than feminine strength.</h3>
<h3>We would rather make choices based on fear of the darkness, than based on understanding it.</h3>
<h3>A culture that values fear of its own darkness will always be at war with itself, and with anything it sees as different.</h3>
<p>*</p>
<h3>As an archetype, Persephone exists within us all.</h3>
<h3>And we should not rescue her from the darkness. We should not try to protect the sweet innocent feminine and keep it safe from the world. To do so is to keep the feminine small and weak.</h3>
<h3>Let her drive late at night. Let her travel alone all over the world. Let her get lost in strange neighborhoods. Let her talk to strangers. Let this little girl face her shadows and devils, let her feel the very real pain and fear that it brings, and let her transform those forces within herself to become a dark and radiant queen.</h3>
<h3>If we rescue this maiden and try to protect her innocence, then she won&rsquo;t connect with her own power.</h3>
<h3>Then the creatures of the darkness will always feel like monsters to her. (That is, aspects of our own shadows will always feel like monsters to us.)</h3>
<h3>We&rsquo;ll always be at war with ourselves.</h3>

<h3>In Vietnam, the communist government will not focus much attention on the anniversary, but many of the Vietnamese people that reside in the northernmost provinces will commemorate the day with visits to the graves of family members that died during the 1979 Chinese invasion.</h3>
<h3>In the West, the Sino-Vietnamese War is largely misunderstood or simply forgotten. The most obvious question is, &ldquo;Why did it happen?&rdquo; How is it that fraternal communist states managed to go to war with each other in the midst of the Cold War between communist and capitalist nations?</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The first part of the answer is that many fraternal communist states were not as &ldquo;fraternal&rdquo; as they wanted the world to believe. </span></h3>
<h3>Vietnam and Communist China had never had warm relations. Vietnam saw its powerful neighbor to the north as a constant threat to its security and was leery of Chinese military assistance during the French-Indochinese War. The USSR and Communist China had also failed to realize anything like &ldquo;fraternal warmth&rdquo; and were occasionally involved in military skirmishes along their shared border.</h3>
<h3>As the French-Indochinese War played out, the USSR and communist North Vietnam developed close relations. The USSR was the main provider of military and economic aid to North Vietnam. That close relationship continued during the American-Indochinese War.</h3>
<h3>When the US abandoned Vietnam, the communist Vietnamese government wanted to consolidate communist revolutions in Laos and Cambodia under Vietnamese hegemony with support from, and allegiance to, the USSR. The Vietnamese viewed this as the most obvious strategy for keeping China out of Southeast Asia.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Unfortunately for Vietnam, China had its own plans for Southeast Asia.</span></h3>
<h3>Modern Communist Chinese are fond of portraying themselves as being something like a neutral and peace-loving country. They are quick to claim that they have never &ldquo;exported revolution.&rdquo; The inference is that, while the Soviets pursued imperialist aims, China was busy experiencing a joyous cultural revolution and building a better workers&rsquo; paradise. The reality was that, unlike the USSR, Communist China was simply unable to realize its own imperialist aspirations.&nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t keep them from trying.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">While the communists in Vietnam were dealing with the US in South Vietnam, the Chinese were building a Chinese-aligned communist regime in Cambodia.</span></h3>
<h3>In 1975, with the help of China, genocidal maniac leader of the Khmer Rouge communist movement, Pol Pot, came to power in Cambodia. He renamed Cambodia &ldquo;Kampuchea.&rdquo; Pol Pot consolidated his position, and, assured of full support from China, he cut off relations with the communist regime in Hanoi.</h3>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">In 1976, the ruthless Communist Chinese dictator, Mao Zedong, finally succeeded in doing something positive for China. He died.</span></h3>
<h3>When the dust settled, a new and vastly more effective oligarchy led by Deng Xiaoping rose to power in Communist China.&nbsp;Deng had a better grip on reality than Mao ever had. He and his supporters grasped the concept of China as a big country in a bigger world. Deng was more concerned by Soviet aggression.</h3>
<h3>On the surface, his regime had to maintain a veneer of good old-fashioned communist hatred for capitalist demons, but in practice, they quickly began to emulate those &ldquo;capitalist demons.&rdquo; Deng was not in love with capitalist philosophy. He simply admired capitalist results and wanted to improve China&rsquo;s pathetic economy.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">Deng and his supporters were either unwilling or unable to substantially improve relations with the USSR and they quietly made overtures to the US.</span></h3>
<h3>Communist China&rsquo;s continued support for the Pol Pot regime would seem inconsistent with the modernizations and limited liberalizations that were being implemented at home. However, Deng chose to ignore the Khmer Rouge&rsquo;s genocidal conduct because they were the one non-Soviet-controlled option in Cambodia.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">In 1978, with the &ldquo;filthy American imperialist dogs&rdquo; gone and the South Vietnamese government vanquished, the Vietnamese decided to try their own hand at a bit of fun-filled filthy imperialism. They invaded Cambodia. </span></h3>
<h3>The USSR provided financial and military support for the operation. The Chinese were infuriated. They responded by reinforcing their military along their border with the USSR.</h3>
<h3>In 1979, much of the Vietnamese Army was in Cambodia chasing down Khmer Rouge forces and trying to install a Vietnamese-controlled government. Deng&rsquo;s military leaders decided that the time was ripe to invade Vietnam.</h3>
<h3>The Communist Chinese military leadership correctly predicted that the USSR would not attempt to invade or attack China, because the USSR needed to maintain its military focus against well-equipped NATO forces in Europe. The Communist Chinese military incorrectly predicted that Vietnam would quickly recall all of its troops from Cambodia to defend the motherland from the Chinese invasion, and that this would save the Khmer Rouge.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">While visiting the US in January of 1979, Deng Xiaoping told American President Jimmy Carter that, &#8220;The little child is getting naughty; it&#8217;s time he be spanked.&#8221; It was not a bluff.</span></h3>

<h3><span style="color: #993300;">On February 17, 1979, Communist China invaded Vietnam. The details of that war, as with all wars, depend on whom you ask.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The Vietnamese version of the story</span> is that 600,000 of China&rsquo;s best troops invaded Vietnam and raped, pillaged, and murdered women and children. Due to the superiority of the courageous Vietnamese local militia forces, the cowardly Chinese suffered massive casualties and were forced to retreat.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The Chinese version of the story</span> differs a bit. They invaded politely with about 200,000 troops, quickly vanquished the Vietnamese, and, although the path to Hanoi was open, chose to be magnanimous in victory and withdrew from Vietnam.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The truth</span> is that Communist China did mobilize 600,000 troops in Southern China, but only 200,000 crossed the border. Thanks to Soviet satellite imagery, the Vietnamese calculated that the Chinese lacked the required strength and logistical support to actually attack Hanoi. The Vietnamese did not withdraw all of their forces from Cambodia, and the Khmer Rouge did not regain control of Cambodia.</h3>
<h3>The Communist Chinese suffered about 6,500 fatalities and perhaps 15,000 wounded. China claimed to have counted 57,000 dead Vietnamese soldiers and 100,000 dead Vietnamese militia members. The Chinese claims are likely wildly exaggerated, but they may have counted the many unarmed Vietnamese civilian casualties as militia.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">China did not withdraw due to a manpower shortage. It withdrew because it lacked the logistical capability to continue the invasion.</span></h3>
<h3>On their way home, the Chinese did their best to destroy anything useful in northern Vietnam. China could easily tolerate the casualties in Vietnam, but it could not tolerate the economic costs. By March 16, 1979, China had withdrawn from Vietnam.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">The Western media coverage of the war was mostly amateurish, somewhat creative, and often inaccurate. They lacked enough sources in the war zone, but that didn&rsquo;t stop them from making wild assumptions.</span></h3>
<h3>Many in the media focused on the theory that the US Intelligence Community had &ldquo;failed completely&rdquo; in predicting the Chinese invasion. The Intelligence Community hadn&rsquo;t failed at all. When Deng chatted with President Carter in January 1979, Carter told him that the US was aware of the Chinese mobilizations in progress along the Vietnam border. Deng didn&rsquo;t deny it. He was frank with President Carter about his intentions.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">As they usually do, the Western media assumed that, since the CIA had not reported anything to <em>them</em> about the Chinese buildup, it meant the agency was once again blindsided by world events.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">The media then, as now, was unable to fathom that the Director of the CIA reports to the US President (and now to the Director of National Intelligence) rather than to the Press Corps. What the President decides to tell the media is up to the President.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">In the aftermath of the war, Vietnam conducted reprisals against non-ethnic Vietnamese that were assumed to have supported the Chinese invasion.</span> Thousands were killed, and tens of thousands were resettled to work camps in southern Vietnam. The economic damage that the Chinese had inflicted had a long-lasting negative impact on the economy of northern Vietnam.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">For their part, the Chinese instituted a modernization campaign of the military, but that modernization had to wait for the Chinese economy to recuperate from Mao&rsquo;s highly destructive &ldquo;cultural revolution.&rdquo;</span> Only after decades of very profitable trade with capitalist Western nations has that long awaited military modernization finally come to fruition in China.</h3>
<h3><span style="color: #993300;">In 1979, the Vietnamese loathed and feared the Chinese. In 2016, they fear the more powerful, modernized Communist China even more. The 1979 Chinese invasion of Vietnam was not the first. It might well not be the last.</span></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>BREAKING OUT OF THE SAMENESS WRITING RUT</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>By</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong>Vicki Hinze</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">You&rsquo;ve written a lot of books. Now you&rsquo;re sensing yourself or hearing from your editor that all of your lead characters sound, think, and act as if they are the same person. You&rsquo;re on a tight deadline for your next book, and you have no idea what to do to fix this problem <em>quickly</em>. You need insight, and you need it now.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The quick-fix is:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Acknowledge. Accept. Act.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acknowledge.</strong>&nbsp; Writers get into a rut. While they are creative people&mdash;some would say eccentric and flighty; I say, they have one foot planted firmly on the ground and one foot firmly in the clouds&mdash;writers who write for a long time do tend to cycle.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">At first, their characters tend to sound like the writer. Then the writer learns to differentiate story people, to let and even encourage them to be the unique (and universal) people they are. The writer learns to disappear from the page, meaning to filter out his or her own voice and to project the character&rsquo;s.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">After a time writing, the story people gravitate to specific types that appeal most, repulse most, or best fit the story types (think author theme) the specific writer writes. There are specific types of people who are best-suited to tell specific types of stories, and that must be respected by the writer. The author who recognizes this also recognizes the need to guard against sameness and author intrusion into the story. That is accomplished by acceptance of the need to differentiate and respecting the individual created. That is <strong>acceptance.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accept.</strong> Writers tend to cycle and get in this &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; rut because they think and process what they take in and they conclude what they want to put out in the same way, book after book.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the writer looks at things and story people through their own prism. They note what they deem is important and significant, confront complications that they weigh as minor or major (while someone else might assign those same obstacles different weights), and they seek solutions using the same criteria and methods s/he would use in real life. So the risk for this &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; in characters is easy to understand, and that awareness and acceptance should factor into the actions the writer takes to respect the individual natures of the story people. Then, of course, the writer must act on the awareness and acceptance.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Act.</strong> Normally, my first recommendation is to hone observation skills. People share a lot of commonalities but they also have a vast array of unique traits. Their specific combination of unique character traits is what makes every single person different and unique. That&rsquo;s respecting the individual, and this is a vital component of character creation.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When a writer fails to respect the individual, s/he insults the individual <em>and </em>the character actually portrayed. That&rsquo;s a lose/lose situation&mdash;for the character, for the writer, and for the story.&nbsp; That makes identifying individual traits critical for all. So how do we do it?</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The best way to identify these unique character traits&mdash;and we must before we can assign them to a specific character&mdash;is to observe people and note their traits.&nbsp; In observing, we discover a ton of nuances: the little things that make a person unique and different. Then, mix up selected traits and nuances that best serve the story to create the best unique individuals for that story.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Now what follows is no substitute for observation but, being on a tight deadline, the writer needs to cover a lot of ground quickly. Many authors use a service like an Indra Report (www.artcharts.com) to create distinct characters quickly. Give the character a name and birthdate&mdash;and it&rsquo;s helpful to note the report is on a fictional character for a book.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">You&rsquo;ll get an in depth report that is a character. It is, at its core, a comprehensive birth chart (basic motivators, motivations, inclinations and character dispositions) that gives the writer a composite view of a story person. It also discloses talents and complicating drives and urges. So positives and negatives, what makes this character tick and things click for that character, and what ticks the character off. Struggles and challenges, strengths and weaknesses are disclosed. So leave room for plot twists, because the composite will drive the plot into unexpected directions that, while perhaps not natural to the writer, are natural to the character.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">I tested such a report years ago and it did include what they said it would; namely, a three-dimensional character.&nbsp; Incorporating a character crafted from one of these reports is the fastest way discovered in three decades to resolve the character creation &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; challenge.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The writer must still guard against his or her own filters altering the character&rsquo;s dialogue and reactions, and must work deliberately to view the story not from inside his/her head but from inside the character&rsquo;s head and through his or her eyes and perspective.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Even if a writer uses such a report, he or she should not consider the report an easy out for solving the sameness challenge. The author should work diligently to hone his or her observation skills and those skills used in relating those observations.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Specifically, work not to <strong>view</strong> the story through your eyes but to <strong>experience</strong> the story through the character&rsquo;s eyes.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Remember, your story is your life. This story is the character&rsquo;s life.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Respect that and sameness will be but a memory. The characters will take over and break the author out of the sameness writing rut.</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
