  <p>Colts head coach Chuck Pagano confirmed after his press conference today that cornerback Vontae Davis had a surgical procedure on his foot, but it's not expected to be a long-term injury.</p> <p>Yesterday, some <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> fans noticed a since-deleted social media post from Colts cornerback <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71148/vontae-davis">Vontae Davis</a> that appeared to show him recovering from some sort of injury or surgery.</p>
<p>Today, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/MikeWellsNFL/status/702928572961325056" target="_blank">confirmed after his press conference to ESPN's Mike Wells</a> that Davis did indeed undergo a surgical procedure to "clean up" some things in his foot, though it's not expected to be a long-term injury.</p>
<p>Davis has spent the past four seasons with the Colts after a team acquired him in a trade prior to the 2012 season from the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>. &nbsp;Since then, Davis has really emerged into a top-tier cornerback in the NFL and has made the Pro Bowl in each of the past two years. &nbsp;Davis has become a tremendous number one corner for the Colts, and especially considering the uncertainty at the other cornerback spot, it's good to hear that it's nothing major for Davis but rather what sounds like a relatively minor procedure.</p>
<p>The Colts will be looking for someone to play opposite of Davis this offseason, as <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71309/greg-toler">Greg Toler</a> is set to become a free agent and the Colts aren't expected to bring him back. &nbsp;That's an important area to upgrade, but the nice thing for Indianapolis is that they already have their number one guy in place in Vontae Davis.</p>

  <p>Colts head coach Chuck Pagano said today that, when it comes to the offensive line, the interior is the "focal point" for the team to address this offseason.</p> <p>For the first time since the end of season press conference announcing his extension, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> head coach Chuck Pagano met the media on Thursday at the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-combine">NFL Combine</a>. &nbsp;He didn't share much in the way of the team's offseason plans, but he did confirm what many have already noted: the Colts need to add help along their offensive line and on defense, particularly at pass rush.</p>
<p>Regarding the offensive line, Pagano shared his thoughts on the group and mentioned several guys he feels good about, but he added that the interior of the line is really where the Colts need to focus on.</p>
<p>"We feel great about AC [<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130994/anthony-castonzo">Anthony Castonzo</a>] and where he's at," Pagano said. &nbsp;"He'd be the first one to tell you that he can clean up some things and he'll do that, but we feel great about the blindside in him protecting the backside of Andrew [Luck]. &nbsp;And <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/34929/joe-reitz">Joe Reitz</a> came in [and] did a great job at right tackle until we moved him inside and he got hurt, and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/254573/denzell-goode">Denzelle Good's</a> got a bright future, but you want to shore up the middle there. &nbsp;We feel really good about <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245450/jack-mewhort">Jack Mewhort</a> where he's at. &nbsp;I think his ceiling is still high and he's got a lot of room to grow, but he's going to do nothing but get better. &nbsp;Again, the interior of that offensive line - the center and two guard spots - is the focal point."</p>
<p>Nothing that Pagano said is new to the discussion, but it's nice to hear confirmation from the Colts' head coach that the team will be looking at the interior of their line. &nbsp;Many have been projecting the Colts to take an offensive tackle in the first round of the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-draft">NFL Draft</a>, and while that likely won't change, Pagano confirmed what was evident last year: that the biggest needs are on the interior of the line.</p>
<p>The center spot needs work, as neither <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/193647/khaled-holmes">Khaled Holmes</a> nor <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245442/jonotthan-harrison">Jonotthan Harrison</a> have done enough to inspire confidence or be given the starting spot moving forward. &nbsp;Ideally, the Colts could address the position, but the guard spots could stand to be upgraded as well. &nbsp;Pagano did say they're comfortable with where Jack Mewhort is at as the starting left guard (and they should be, since he has played very well there), but they want to add guards to the mix to give them flexibility and improved play inside. &nbsp;At the right tackle position, it sounds like the Colts could be ok with having Joe Reitz and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/255661/denzelle-good">Denzelle Good</a> compete for the spot, though they could make a move this offseason that changes that.</p>
<p>Basically, the bottom line is this: the biggest needs for the Colts along their offensive line are on the interior, and Chuck Pagano realizes that. &nbsp;While he also spoke of the importance of adding pass rushers, it's clear that the Colts will be looking to upgrade the interior of their offensive line this offseason.</p>

  <p>According to AL.com's Matt Zenitz, the Baltimore Ravens are expected to sign former Colts running back Trent Richardson, pending a physical.</p> <p>As the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-combine">NFL Combine</a> goes on in Indianapolis this week, it sounds like one of the biggest draft busts in recent years might be getting another shot. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.al.com/alabamafootball/index.ssf/2016/02/trent_richardson_expected_to_s.html" target="_blank">According to Matt Zenitz of AL.com</a>, the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> are expected to sign former <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> running back <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152651/trent-richardson">Trent Richardson</a>, pending a physical.</p>
<p>Richardson was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2012 <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-draft">NFL Draft</a> by the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/cleveland-browns">Browns</a>, and after rushing for 950 yards and 11 touchdowns as a rookie, he was traded to the Colts for a first round pick just two games into the following season. &nbsp;Richardson's two seasons in Indianapolis, however, were a disaster. &nbsp;Playing in 31 games (including playoffs), Richardson rushed for 978 total yards and six touchdowns, averaging 3.1 yards per carry, and catching 55 passes for 494 yards and three scores. &nbsp;During his last season with the Colts,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2015/2/9/8007937/report-colts-frustrated-with-trent-richardson-over-weight-issues-accessibility" target="_blank">the team was reportedly frustrated with weight issues and questions of accessibility</a>, and Richardson was suspended for the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/afc-championship-game">AFC Championship</a> game that year as well. &nbsp;Following the 2014 season, the Colts officially parted ways with the running back. &nbsp;Since then, he spent time in training camp with the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/oakland-raiders">Raiders</a> and has had some workouts, but he didn't play anywhere in 2015.</p>
<p>The Ravens currently only have three running backs on their roster, so they do have the space and need to add another one. &nbsp;It sounds like that might be Richardson, which just further goes to show that teams will give players several chances if that player was a highly-regarded prospect coming out of college. &nbsp;Richardson had a productive career at Alabama and was obviously impressive enough to scouts to go number three overall in the draft, so the Ravens are likely hoping that they can finally be the team that helps Richardson figure things out and be successful in the NFL. &nbsp;The Browns, Colts, and Raiders haven't been able to, however, so it's doubtful it will happen in Baltimore.</p>

  <p>The Indianapolis Colts will have an extra $4.95 million in salary cap space this year thanks to carryover from last year.</p> <p>The NFL's salary cap for 2016 has not been officially set, but it appears that the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> should have plenty of cap space to work with.</p>
<p>The NFL Players Association this morning announced the amount of salary cap carryover for each team this year, and the Colts have opted to carryover $4,950,629 in unused cap space from last year to this year. &nbsp;For comparison, the teams carrying over the most cap space are the Colts' AFC South rivals, the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> ($32,774,928) and the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a> ($20,783,801).</p>
<p>The cap has not officially been announced, though&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2016/2/15/11002804/report-nfl-salary-cap-expected-to-be-at-least-155-million-in-2016" target="_blank">a recent report said the cap would be at least $155 million this year</a>. &nbsp;The even more recent report of the owners withholding funds from players in recent years could cause the cap to increase even more, while the Colts will then have nearly $5 million in cap space added on top of that. &nbsp;Using a projected $155 million cap,&nbsp;<a href="http://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space" target="_blank">Over the Cap projects the Colts to have nearly $25 million in cap space</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is likely that the Colts will make some moves that would free up even more cap space, such as releasing <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2728/andre-johnson">Andre Johnson</a> (which would save $5 million) and/or <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/1307/trent-cole">Trent Cole</a> (which would save $6.125 million). &nbsp;In other words, they should have plenty of room to work with this offseason, which is a good thing when considering the needs they have. &nbsp;They surely would like to keep some of their own free agents, with guys like <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/34788/jerrell-freeman">Jerrell Freeman</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2833/adam-vinatieri">Adam Vinatieri</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154893/dwayne-allen">Dwayne Allen</a>, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154865/coby-fleener">Coby Fleener</a>, and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/34366/dwight-lowery">Dwight Lowery</a> being potential targets. &nbsp;They also could stand to upgrade several other positions, such as offensive line, pass rush, and cornerback. &nbsp;Additionally, the team would like to get quarterback <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152649/andrew-luck">Andrew Luck</a> under contract long-term, which could take up a bit more cap space as well. &nbsp;The good news in all of that? &nbsp;The Colts will have plenty of cap room to work with.</p>

  <p>Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said today at the NFL Scouting Combine that he thinks Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning is "arguably the best that's ever played."</p> <p>In 1998, the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> used thee first overall pick in the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-draft">NFL Draft</a> to select quarterback <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/2807/peyton-manning">Peyton Manning</a>. &nbsp;His position coach for those crucial first three seasons in Indy was a man named Bruce Arians.</p>
<p>Now, nearly two decades later, the careers of Manning and Arians have really taken off. &nbsp;Manning has gone on to a Hall of Fame career, setting passing records and winning five NFL MVP awards. &nbsp;Arians has been the league's Coach of the Year winner in two of the past four seasons, and before that he won two <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/super-bowl">Super Bowl</a>s as an assistant with the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. &nbsp;Manning has developed a reputation as one of the very best quarterbacks to ever play the game, while Arians has developed a reputation of developing quarterbacks.</p>
<p>Manning is possibly at the end of his stellar career, however, as he's contemplating retirement this offseason following the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/denver-broncos">Broncos</a>' Super Bowl win. &nbsp;Denver head coach <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/253777/gary-kubiak">Gary Kubiak</a> said today at the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-combine">NFL Scouting Combine</a> that there's no hurry for Manning to make a decision, though there's likely only a few weeks left for him to actually do so. &nbsp;Arians, the current head coach of the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>, also spoke at the Combine on Wednesday and shared some thoughts on his former pupil.</p>
<p>"This word GOAT [greatest of all time] got popular real soon. &nbsp;To me, he is," Arians said of Manning. &nbsp;"Having worked with him early in the years that he was struggling was fun. &nbsp;To watch him persevere&nbsp;through those early years, the 3-13, 15 interceptions in the first eight games or whatever, then just watch him grow and take off and become the player<br>he's become, I think he's arguably the best that's ever played."</p>
<p>Of course, Arians is biased, having worked with Manning for three years in Indianapolis, but at the same time his assessment of quarterbacks is valued and worth noting. &nbsp;There's certainly a strong case to be made for Manning as the greatest of all time, as he holds the NFL records for passing yards and passing touchdowns while he is the league's only five-time MVP - holding two more such distinctions than anyone else. &nbsp;And, for those who value Super Bowl rings to measure players, Manning's also got two of those. &nbsp;He has without a doubt changed the way the quarterback position is played, and the current NFL that we know today is a testament to that. &nbsp;Bruce Arians had a hand in that, though he doesn't take the credit for it.</p>
<p>"I'm just a quarterback coach,"&nbsp;<a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/arizona-cardinals/post/_/id/19504/where-bruce-arians-grew-his-roots-as-a-quarterback-whisperer" target="_blank">Arians told ESPN a few weeks ago</a>. &nbsp;"[Manning's] become one of the greatest ever. &nbsp;I can't take any credit for him. &nbsp;Mom and Dad and God, they made him. &nbsp;Same with Ben [Roethlisberger] and Andrew [Luck]. &nbsp;But it's nice to know you had a touch in their mechanics, things that they remember. &nbsp;That part of it makes it special."</p>
<p>Sure he's biased, but if you ask Bruce Arians, Peyton Manning is the best to ever play the game.</p>

  <p>Michigan State offensive tackle Jack Conklin said today that he will interview with 24 teams this week at the NFL Combine, including the Indianapolis Colts.</p> <p>The <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> will be busy meeting with a number of different prospects this week at the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-combine">NFL Scouting Combine</a>, as they can interview as many as 60 different players. &nbsp;Michigan State offensive tackle, the most commonly projected player to the Colts in mock drafts,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ColtsReporter/status/702593585808420864" target="_blank">said today that he will meet with 24 different teams this week</a>, including the Colts.</p>
<p>Conklin (6-6, 325 pounds) was a three-year starter at Michigan State, starting 38 career games before deciding to enter the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-draft">NFL Draft</a> following his junior season. &nbsp;He was a first-team All-American in 2015 and helped Michigan State make an appearance in the College Football Playoffs. &nbsp;Conklin started 35 games at left tackle and three at right tackle, and he projects to be able to play either spot in the NFL, along with perhaps guard depending on what teams think about him. &nbsp;With the Colts, he would likely play at right tackle if they draft him, since <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/130994/anthony-castonzo">Anthony Castonzo</a> is in place at left tackle.</p>
<p>The Colts will certainly be looking at a number of different offensive linemen this week, as we've already heard of them interviewing or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2016/2/24/11108238/colts-to-interview-stanford-guard-joshua-garnett-at-nfl-combine" target="_blank">planning to interview Stanford guard Joshua Garnett</a> in addition to Conklin. &nbsp;The team is expected to address the area this offseason in an attempt to protect <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/152649/andrew-luck">Andrew Luck</a>, and it's entirely possible that they could use their first round pick on a lineman this year. &nbsp;One of the most important parts of Combine week is the interview process, and it sounds like the Colts plan to talk with several players along the offensive line this week as they continue their draft evaluations.</p>

  <p>Stanford guard Joshua Garnett said that he will meet with the Indianapolis Colts at the NFL Scouting Combine this week.</p> <p>One of the most important parts of the annual <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-combine" class="sbn-auto-link">NFL Scouting Combine</a> are the interviews that teams can have with prospects, as teams are allowed up to 60 individual meetings with players. &nbsp;One such player the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts" class="sbn-auto-link">Indianapolis Colts</a> will meet with this year is Stanford guard Joshua Garnett,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ColtsReporter/status/702562081921441794">who confirmed as much during his press conference on Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Could he wind up protecting fellow Stanford alum Andrew Luck with the Colts? &nbsp;"That would be awesome," Garnett said today. &nbsp;"Andrew Luck was one of those guys that you grew up and watched at Stanford. &nbsp;I was in the ninth grade when he was a senior&nbsp;at Stanford. &nbsp;Every day at Stanford, you would see Andrew Luck outside the offensive line room. &nbsp;If I had the chance to block for him, he's one of&nbsp;the greats, he's one of the Stanford greats in the NFL. &nbsp;I would relish that opportunity."</p>
<p>That picture of Andrew Luck outside the offensive line room? &nbsp;"Oh yeah, it's a big picture of Andrew Luck," Garnett said. &nbsp;"He's kind of like, doing something awesome, I'm sure it was. &nbsp;It was a still shot."</p>
<p>Garnett (6-5, 321 pounds) is one of the best interior offensive linemen in this year's draft class. &nbsp;He played both guard positions at Stanford and currently projects as a day two pick as a player who could be a reliable starter for a team inside. &nbsp;He won the Outland Trophy in 2015 as the country's top interior offensive lineman, won the Morris Trophy as the Pac-12's best offensive lineman, and was a first-team All-American. &nbsp;He was a captain at Stanford and their starting left guard, helping to anchor a strong offensive line.</p>
<p>The Colts could use help on the interior of their offensive line, and Garnett would slide in at right guard with the team due to <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245450/jack-mewhort" class="sbn-auto-link">Jack Mewhort</a> in place at left guard. &nbsp;If the Colts could grab the Stanford offensive line on day two of the draft, it would be a great move to improve their offensive line with a good, smart player. &nbsp;The interview process this week will likely help the Colts to get to know Garnett more and see whether he might be a fit with the team. &nbsp;The Colts will talk with a number of prospects so a meeting doesn't mean a whole lot, but it's still interesting and worth noting.</p>

  <p>According to the Houston Chronicle's Aaron Wilson, Andre Johnson's agent says the receiver has not discussed retirement and is preparing for the 2016 season.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, NFL Media's Ian Rapoport&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stampedeblue.com/2016/2/24/11105388/report-andre-johnson-has-played-his-last-down-with-colts-pondering-retirement" target="_blank">mentioned that Colts wide receiver Andre Johnson is pondering retirement</a>. &nbsp;According to Johnson's agent, however, that's not true.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AaronWilson_NFL/status/702505339846062080" target="_blank">Aaron Wilson of The Houston Chronicle spoke with Kennard McGuire</a>, the agent for Johnson, who said that, "Retirement hasn't been discussed. &nbsp;Andre is training and preparing for next season."</p>
<p>McGuire's statement brings the other part of Rapoport's report even more into light: Rapoport said that Johnson "has played his last down in Indy." &nbsp;In other words, the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts">Colts</a> are planning the cut the wideout if he doesn't retire. &nbsp;Since Johnson's agent makes it seem like his client won't be hanging it up anytime soon, that means we should expect an announcement at some point before the start of the new league year announcing the Colts' release of the veteran receiver.</p>
<p>The Colts can save $5 million in cap space next season by releasing Johnson, who didn't produce anywhere near expectations in his first season in Indianapolis. &nbsp;He caught 41 passes for 503 yards and four touchdowns, failing to be a difference-maker and instead often being invisible. &nbsp;<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245451/donte-moncrief">Donte Moncrief</a> rightly started taking snaps from Johnson as the season went on, and with <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/154920/t-y-hilton">T.Y. Hilton</a>, Moncrief, and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/254430/phillip-dorsett">Phillip Dorsett</a> as young talented receivers, the decision to move on from Johnson is an obvious one for the Colts. &nbsp;He has had a tremendous career, but it's the right move for the Colts to part ways with him. &nbsp;It sounds like that will happen, though according to Johnson's agent the veteran receiver plans to keep playing in 2016 instead of retiring.</p>
