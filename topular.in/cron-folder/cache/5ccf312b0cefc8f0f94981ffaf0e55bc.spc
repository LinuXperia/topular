Ukraine urges to release all Ukrainians illegally detained in Russian Federation.

In August, the Chicago's Ukrainian community held a rally initiated by the Illinois Division of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA) with the General Consulate of Ukraine in Chicago to demand the release of Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov and political activist Olexandr Kolchenko who were sentenced to 20 and 10 years of imprisonment, respectively.

The Ukrainian activists were first detained by Russian authorities in the spring of 2014, and were later <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2015/08/25/ukrainian-filmmaker-sentenced-to-20-years-in-russia" target="_blank">convicted</a> on several terrorism charges by the Rostov-on-Don military court on 25 August 2015.

Senator Richard Durbin, members of Congress Jan Schakowsky, Peter Roskam, Mike Quigley, and Danny Davis sent written letters protesting the arrests and sentencing to long years in prison. Chicago Laura Dilyte-Butkiene, First Secretary of the Consulate General of the Republic of Lithuania, joined the protest and condemned the sentencing of the Ukrainians by the Russian court.

Senator Durbin and Congresswoman Schakowsky termed the terrorist attacks plots as “baseless allegations.” “These men did nothing more than peacefully protest Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea. In Response, both were taken hostage in Ukrainian territory, transported to and imprisoned in jail,” stated Rep. Schakowsky. She further suggested that the prisoners lack of access to lawyers, family and others is “a huge miscarriage of justice,” violating Russia’s former commitments to a bilateral exchange of captured war prisoners with Ukraine.

In his statement, Senator Durbin added that the current actions demonstrate “how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to go to deflect attention from the brutal crackdown on freedom inside his own country and his corrupt and failing economy.”

Congressman Danny Davis emphasized that the trial was a “clear violation of human rights.” The U.S. State Department proclaimed the trial as “fatally flawed.” Congressman Peter Roskam also expressed his outrage calling the imprisonment of Sentsov and Kolchenko along with other Ukrainians currently held in Russian jails “completely unacceptable” and “false.” He termed Russia’s actions as “a scandalous series of show trials reminiscent of the darkest days of the Stalinist Era.” Ultimately, the U.S. officials called upon the Russian Federation to fulfill its Minsk agreements and immediately release the prisoners.

The conference, which took place in Berlin, was attended by a large delegation of American policy makers, including six senators and nine members of the House of Representatives, who discussed the standing of the Minsk II ceasefire with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and representatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Minsk II ceasefire was signed in February by members of the Normandy Four, a coalition of the heads of state of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany. The ceasefire was implemented to replace a previous Minsk agreement from September, which was considered to have failed as Russian-backed rebels invaded Debaltseve, an important Eastern Ukrainian transportation hub, in January. While the United States has taken a back seat to the European Union in negotiating peace for Ukraine, Sen. Durbin and the Senate Ukraine Caucus which he leads are still very much invested in ending the conflict.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-819 aligncenter" alt="durbin-chicago-ukraine" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/ukrainian-chicago/files/2015/04/durbin-chicago-ukraine.png" width="570" height="365" /></p>
According to what he learned at the Aspen Institute, Sen. Durbin said that Minsk II was “nominally in place,” at best, and non-existent at worst, “because people are still dying, and many people are still being displaced.” He considers it a fatal flaw to include Russia unless it admitted to instigating the conflict.

“We are watching the Russians very carefully and closely to see if they go so far as to literally end the ceasefire,” said Sen. Durbin. For him personally, Minsk II would be considered to have failed if Mariupol, an Eastern Ukrainian port city, falls from Ukrainian government control. Sen. Durbin also fears that Russia will shed its persona of non-involvement in the conflict, and begin an outright invasion of Ukraine. In which case, the senator said, “he could have his armies in Kyiv in a week.”
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" wp-image-820 aligncenter" alt="IMG_9143" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/ukrainian-chicago/files/2015/04/IMG_9143.jpg" width="567" height="378" /></p>
Sen. Durbin also says that American reconnaissance, from satellites and aerial photography, suggests that Russia is preparing for that very scenario. With one of the largest militaries in the world, he called Russia, “a force for any country to reckon with.”

“We are very skeptical of Moscow, of Putin, and what his goals are,” said Sen. Durbin. “Our fear is that Putin, once getting a foothold in Ukraine, is going to invade other countries. Moldova is a country that would be very easy to strike. Then the question is if he would go into a NATO country.”

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk also met with the American Congressional delegation in Berlin to further discuss more effective diplomatic means to ending the conflict in Ukraine.

“He’s hoping that the ceasefire will hold. He’s hoping that we’ll get to have a diplomatic discussion about how to end the violence,” said Sen. Durbin of the prime minister. “But he’s still very concerned, and he’s looking for support from the West.”

Sen. Durbin believes that the United States should provide Ukraine with defensive weaponry, in addition to expanding U.S. humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Sen. Durbin says he agrees with his Republican colleagues, like Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mark Kirk, that the United States has to allow the capability for Ukraine to properly defend itself.

While the decision to grant Ukraine weaponry has not yet been made, and is largely being met with resistance from the White House, Sen. Durbin said they are taking <a href="http://www.thechicagocouncil.org/ukraine" target="_blank">recommendations</a> from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs as to what weapon systems might be most appropriate to send to Ukraine.

According to the senator, six out of the seven systems that are being considered for Ukraine are defensive in nature, including reconnaissance drones and tracing missiles that can automatically and precisely fire on where an enemy rocket originated.

“The Ukrainians simply don’t have that kind of precision,” said Sen. Durbin.

He clarified that the defensive systems would only be given to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, and not any of the volunteer battalions fighting alongside them. He suggested that modern, intelligent weapons systems can be programmed to only work when operated by the Ukrainian government.

Sen. Durbin will be convening a meeting with the Senate Ukraine Caucus next week to formally request weapons systems from the White House.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Julian Hayda";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5407:"U.S. Senator Dick Durbin met with members of the Ukrainian community in Chicago Thursday to discuss his recent participation in an Aspen Institute conference on the conflict in Ukraine. The conference, which took place in Berlin, was attended by a large delegation of American policy makers, including six senators and nine members of the House of Representatives, who discussed the standing of the Minsk II ceasefire with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and representatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Minsk II ceasefire was signed in February by members of the Normandy Four, a coalition of the heads of state of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany. The ceasefire was implemented to replace a previous Minsk agreement from September, which was considered to have failed as Russian-backed rebels invaded Debaltseve, an important Eastern Ukrainian transportation hub, in January. While the United States has taken a back seat to the European Union in negotiating peace for Ukraine, Sen. Durbin and the Senate Ukraine Caucus which he leads are still very much invested in ending the conflict.

According to what he learned at the Aspen Institute, Sen. Durbin said that Minsk II was “nominally in place,” at best, and non-existent at worst, “because people are still dying, and many people are still being displaced.” He considers it a fatal flaw to include Russia unless it admitted to instigating the conflict.

“We are watching the Russians very carefully and closely to see if they go so far as to literally end the ceasefire,” said Sen. Durbin. For him personally, Minsk II would be considered to have failed if Mariupol, an Eastern Ukrainian port city, falls from Ukrainian government control. Sen. Durbin also fears that Russia will shed its persona of non-involvement in the conflict, and begin an outright invasion of Ukraine. In which case, the senator said, “he could have his armies in Kyiv in a week.”

Sen. Durbin also says that American reconnaissance, from satellites and aerial photography, suggests that Russia is preparing for that very scenario. With one of the largest militaries in the world, he called Russia, “a force for any country to reckon with.”

“We are very skeptical of Moscow, of Putin, and what his goals are,” said Sen. Durbin. “Our fear is that Putin, once getting a foothold in Ukraine, is going to invade other countries. Moldova is a country that would be very easy to strike. Then the question is if he would go into a NATO country.”

Last month U.S. Senators Kirk, Durbin, and McCain sent a formal request to Secretary of State John Kerry for a tightening of international sanctions against Russia and provision of defensive weapons to the Ukrainian troops.

“We're going to deploy to Poland to make sure that NATO commitment is backed with boots on the ground. We will show Putin that we are standing behind European democracy,” Senator Kirk said.

Agreeing, Senator McCain also added, “I believe with everything I know that Vladimir Putin’s ambitions are to restore the Russian Empire.” He expressed concerns about the extent of Russia’s imperialistic goals. “Vladimir Putin has reverted to the old rhetoric of the Soviet Union,” McCain said. “It’s blatant lies, that everyone kind of knows is a blatant lie, but they don’t care. And, of course, Vladimir Putin continues to now threaten other nations.”

Both Senator Kirk and Senator McCain strongly endorsed arming Ukrainian troops and made promises to stand strong in the U.S. government for the Ukrainian people.

“I stand before you not as a republican, not as a democrat, but I stand before you as a man who loves your country, a man who has had the opportunity to see the beauty of this people, and a wonder of one of the most beautiful parts of the world,” John McCain said. “I personally will always remember as long as I live--I will never forget the people of the Maidan. I will never forget the three hundred thousand people in the freezing cold, many of them hungry, there because they wanted what so many of us here take for granted.”

Senator Kirk further corroborated McCain’s words with a strong push for weaponry.

Dozens of rockets fired from a Grad multiple launcher rained down on the area, spewing deadly shrapnel. One of them landed just meters from the bus and riddled the vehicle and its passengers with metal shards.

And here you go, right now you’re flipping through the pages of a print version of Ukrainian Chicago,” Yuriy Figel, co-founder of Chicago-based multimedia company VIDIA, which publishes the magazine, said in the opening remarks of the first issue.

The magazine will feature prominent Ukrainians, Ukrainian Americans, Ukrainian lifestyle, and more stories on Ukraine, according to Figel. It will be published every two weeks in English and Ukrainian and distributed for free in the places popular with Ukrainians in Chicago.

In addition to Jaresko, Poroshenko decreed citizenship on Aleksandr Kvitashvili and Aivaras Abromavicius, who are natives of Georgia and Lithuania, respectively.

Ukrainian Americans in the middle of Chicago's Ukrainian Village, huddled for warmth in inadvertent solidarity with their countrymen who stood for the Revolution of Dignity in Kyiv, half a world away.

Following a prayer service at Sts. Volodymyr and Olha Church, the crowd descended its stairs for a rally commemorating a year to the day since hundreds of students were beaten by Ukraine's Special Forces for condemning then-president Viktor Yanukovych's withdrawal from a European Union integration deal. Thee months of protesting and over a hundred dead later, Yanukovych fled, and a new government was formed.

Participants of the rally, though there to commemorate the Maidan, largely expressed their anger over the separatist war in Eastern Ukraine that has been instigated by Russian-backed rebels following the new government's rise to power.

Many of the rally's participants held signs blaming the Russian Federation and its president for the explosion of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 over Eastern Ukraine in July, others pushed for the passage of pending American legislation to support the new Ukrainian government's defense efforts.

The latter group was heard loud and clear by the legislators attending the rally: Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), and Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who in a bipartisan show of support to Ukraine, promised to live up to the demands of their Ukrainian constituents.
