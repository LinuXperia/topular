<p><strong>Young Mix – Winter in Brooklyn Ep</strong></p>
<p>San Francisco’s <a href="http://youngmix.bandcamp.com">Young Mix</a> released a new EP packed with honest lyrics about personal relationships, career aspirations, failures and more. The laid-back production is reminiscent of California vibes (not the G-funk descendants like DJ Mustard/Hyphy. Cali but the Souls of Mischief  Zion I, Cali). My personal favorite is the psychedelic “Sunrise, Sunset” but there is something in there for everyone. For instance, “PTSD” speaks on a number of social issues including police brutality and immigration.</p>

<p><strong>Rye Mann – We Love It Here</strong></p>
<p>It took 3 years for Oakland producer Rye Mann to finish <a href="http://ryemann.bandcamp.com">We Love it Here</a> and he can be proud of the time he spent. Two traits that immediately come to mind are Rye Mann’s ability to create diverse instrumentals, which can be seen in the range of featured artists on the album, and the fact that he just makes catchy beats. I found myself being drawn into each song almost immediately after the track started. There is room to grow but overall, a very exciting project from the East Bay.</p>

<p><strong>Balance – Always Playin ft. Symba Produced by Cisco</strong></p>
<p>Tomorrow, Balance will be releasing a new EP 41510: Redwall and I have the last preview he released. Cisco provided the piercing beat for Balance and Symba to ask girls why they’re playing if they want a real n**** around verses filled with lists of ways that girls do the wrong things to them.</p>

<p><strong>Mal Forte – Worthwhile ft. Kehlani</strong></p>
<p>I think this qualifies as one of those “love songs for guys.” Although Mal Forte is speaking to a girl, persuading her of his validity, he switches the flow up a few times and displays an impressive lyrical ability throughout. As far as the Bay goes, having a hook from Kehlani is about as good as it gets, right? “Worthwhile” can be found on Mal Forte’s sophomore album Better Late Than Never which is out now.<br />

Although not taking home a trophy, we were excited to see Kehlani, Colin Tilley (who directed Kendrick Lamar’s video for “Alright”), the Grateful Dead (a box set was nominated for a packaging related award) and the country singer Cam honored with nominations. However, the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte that relocated to San Jose in the 1960s won for their recent album Realidades. There is also a jazz musician, Mario Silva, who played on this year’s best reggae album – Morgan Heritage’s Strictly Roots – and will get a plaque for it. Lastly, the director of music recording at Skywalker Sound in Marin County, Lisa Ann Jones, took home her 4th Grammy after Ask Your Mama was selected as the best engineered classical album. Not only did she win again but she actually in charge of mixing the sound FOR THE GRAMMYS on Monday.

<p><strong>Don Toriano – Bay Shit ft. Berner, Rich Rocka &amp; Goldie</strong></p>
<p>Got a laidback anthem for you to play out for the rest of 2016. Now that the sun is back out, we have some smooth “Bay Shit” from Don Toriano with Rich Rocka and Goldie of Federation. The song is just littered with homages to the Bay starting from the RIP shoutout to the Mac in the opening seconds. I mean, I really don’t have to sell this one, just hit play! This is for everyone “on that bay shit, every single day bitch”.</p>

<p><strong>Outrageous Karina - Ready [produced by Nate Hendrix &amp; BarzMakesBangers]</strong></p>
<p>“Ready” is actually my introduction to San Jose’s Outrageous Karina. The last track on her debut .evoL EP was enough to make me want to listen to the first four. I am immediately drawn to the song’s lack of real structure; it is very unique yet still maintains a fluidity that you find in more traditional popular music. Nate Hendrix, who produced the whole EP, got some help from BarzMakesBangers for “Ready’s” instrumental. It lets her take a slow start and warm up to a burst of lyrics before finishing with another melodic re-work of a ‘chorus’. The beat honestly isn’t the highlight but it gets the job more than adequately done.</p>

<p><strong>ANTWON - Luv</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure if this song really belongs in the strip club despite that it was probably made strictly for that purpose. It definitely belongs on the soundtrack of a chase scene in the upcoming “Fast and Furious” movie. I listened to “Luv” by Antwon over and over again trying to decide whether I really liked it and needed to include it in The Bay Beat or if I didn’t want to hear it again. Obviously I chose to include this track from the upcoming Double Ecstasy EP out on April 1st. Antwon himself said that this EP was “definitely the most fun to make. It showed me why I started playing in bands and collaborating with other people.”</p>

Considering the fact that Martino was one of the world’s foremost jazz guitarists, this was a serious problem.<br />
Born and raised Pat Azzara in Philadelphia in the mid-1940s, Martino’s early exposure to jazz music came from his father, Carmen “Mickey” Azzara, who once studied with Eddie Lang, the so-called “Father of Jazz Guitar.” An avid member of the city’s music scene and a singer at local clubs, Mickey took young Pat to all the local hotspots, introducing him to jazz legends such as Wes Montgomery and John Coltrane. To this day, Martino cites his father as one of his greatest influences and inspirations, and credits him for the decision to pursue a serious career in music.</p>
<p>Martino began playing guitar at age 12, dropping out of high school as a sophomore to focus on his craft full-time, and became deeply involved in Philadelphia’s growing rock scene alongside early luminaries such as Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, and Bobby Darin. He toured with jazz organist Charles Earland and gigged with Lloyd Price, Slide Hampton and Red Holloway before deciding to relocate to Harlem to immerse himself in the vibrant hard bop and soul jazz movement that was forming there.</p>

<p><strong>E-40 – Slappin ft. Nef the Pahroah and Dram</strong></p>
<p>E-40’s latest song “Slappin” is like an updated version of our hyphy movement. It is unmistakably Bay Area from the Rick Rock beat to OG 40 water punch lines and one of the more buzzin up-and-comers, Nef the Pharoah. Plus now E-40 gets to reference Sluricane and his various other alcoholic beverages. The instrumental takes the staples from 2004-2009’s music but stripped away many of the more annoying elements that didn’t age as well. And I couldn’t believe how at home D.R.A.M. sounded on this cut! Is he really from Virginia??</p>

<p><strong>Dregs Ill Sugi – Emotion ft. Gas Mask Colony</strong></p>
<p>This is proof of hip hop’s ability to transcend borders, a true display of hip hop’s global reach. Dregs-One is the wordy, intelligent emcee from San Francisco that many of us already know. Ill Sugi is a producer from Tokyo, Japan that found Dregs’ music on the Internet; the two worked together online until Sugi visited the Bay and the Universal Language album was born. Cascade Records is the French label that released this album. The gritty, grimy video matches the beat’s vibe on “Emotion”. Dregs-One and fellow SF natives of the Gas Mask Colony take you to a few spots around the city as they rap about situations where one might get emotional.</p>
<p><em>“Keep the melody moving / going through the motions when my emotions are flowing through the music / it’s proven, the beat therapeutic / tradition is deep rooted”</em></p>

<p><strong>Iamsu! - Dogs</strong></p>
<p>Wooo!! Suzy goes IN! I love when Iamsu! makes those super catchy, more melodic tracks but it is also fun when he decides to really rap too. Like his verse on E-40’s “Function”, Iamsu picks his flow up a bit and delivers a straight barrage of non-stop bars. Trauma Tone’s bare, trap sounding beat only lasts 2 and a half minutes but sets the pace right as needed.</p>
<p><em>“Speak to the plug in Spanish / Hola amigo, que paso? / On 23rd with the vatos/ Niggas be feeling themselves, get filled with them shells / Bitch it’s like a taco”</em></p>

<p>Oakland rapper Daveed Diggs is having quite the year. He has been starring in the musical Hamilton on Broadway and it was just announced that the play would be making a run here in San Francisco next year, 2017. He recently sat down with 7x7 to discuss his Oakland upbringing, how the Bay Area will receive Hamilton and hip hop’s influence including, “In the Bay, we breed nimble-tongued rappers, and we also over-enunciate; we hit our Rs really hard… So, I get a lot of really good, fast rap moments [in the show]—stuff that plays to my strengths.” <a href="http://www.7x7.com/culture/meet-oakland-rapper-daveed-diggs-star-broadway-smash-hit-hamilton" target="_blank">Read the full interview here</a>.</p>

Despite starting their career as an all-instrumental band, Monophonics added keyboardist and vocalist Kelly Finnigan to the mix in 2010, bringing a notable dose of soulful grit to their classic grooves. Over the years, they’ve performed with a wide range of music legends, from Al Green to Karl Denson to folk musician Rodriguez. They’ve toured music festivals and venues around the world, known for their superb musicianship and uncanny ability to make an audience get up and dance.</p>

<p>Before I get started, I HAVE to take a moment to honor, remember and extol <strong>The Jacka</strong>. The Oakland Native was tragically gunned down one year ago, yesterday, February 2nd. Mob Figaz, the solo work, collaborative projects with Andre Nickatina, Freeway, Berner, Dubble-OO, Lil Keke, Messy Marv and so many more. He gave us a ton of music, was an influential member of the Bay Area’s scene and was taken far too soon.</p>

<p>As most of the United States knows, <strong>Super Bowl 50</strong> will be played in Santa Clara this Sunday, February 7th. What does that mean for the Bay Area hip-hop scene? Well Miguel, DJ Khaled, Fabolous, Travis Scott, Eric Bellinger, Diddy, Ne-Yo, August Alsina, Pharrell, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, French Montana, T.I., 50 Cent, Alicia Keys and I’m sure many many more will be joining some of our biggest names from Keak Da Sneak and E-40 to star-in-the-making Kehlani on stages across the Bay. I can’t tell you how many hip-hop artists will be out here performing, hosting events or just partying at your favorite club. Keep your eyes open; you don’t want to miss these chances!</p>

<p>Next up I got a new video from <strong>J.Lately</strong>. The well-composed video features J.Lately reflecting back on someone that plays a much larger role in his mind than they do in his life. Director Andrew Elsayid’s rain and low-lit video backdrop builds on the foundation that Oops darker production’ built. “How many mother#$%in songs can I write?” J.Lately and Della ask, admitting both regret and fault about things past, asking for a potential shot in the future. “All About You” can be found on the recently released album Let’s Just Be Friends. J. Lately was also recently named one of 2016’s Top 15 to Watch For by Da-What+Friends.</p>

<p><strong>J. Stalin and Philthy Rich</strong> stopped by Sway’s Universe while out in New York for an in-depth interview. I hope I don’t have to remind y’all about Sway’s hometown or that this is an all Bay affair. In addition to the standard radio interview discussion about the respective artists’ background, their upcoming projects and what the world has going on, J. Stalin and Sway dug a bit into the Bay’s history. These guys give us a very long list of talented artists from all around the Bay; Stalin admits that for the first time, he thinks, the movement is working together. Sway even confirmed that one of the main reasons he left the Bay Are in the 90s, after creating the Wake Up Show, was a lack of unity and backlash. If you have 45 minutes or need something to throw on while you work, here you go.</p>
<p>You can catch<strong> J Stalin</strong> live at Slim's on <a href="http://www.slimspresents.com/event/j-stalin-slims-w-aka-frank-trill-youngins-lil-yase/">Sat. March 15, 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’ll conclude with a Bay Area shoutout to another hip-hop educational group: <strong>HipHopForChange</strong>. This Oakland based organization uses hip-hop music and the surrounding culture to help combat socio-economic injustice. Their grassroots activism includes speaking engagements, educational discussions and workshops to engage in important discussion; HipHopForChange even raises money for efforts that help alleviate these problems too. To accomplish these goals hip hop concerts are produced, they broadcast on KPOO, and even release mixtapes with progressive messages. If you are looking for ways to get involved in using hip hop for good, <a href="http://www.hiphopforchange.org/">this is a great place to start</a>.</p>
<p>Tune in next Wednesday for Volume 3 of the Bay Beat. If you want something considered for a future issue – reach out on Twitter with the hashtag #TheBayBeat!</p>

<p><strong>Q102 – The Throwback Station</strong><br />
Since 2014, Q102 has been blasting old school hip hop through the Bay Area’s speakers at a consistently quality rate.   It is nice to have a radio station that is playing anything different than the popular rotation, no shots fired!, let alone 80s, 90s and 2000s hip hop/R&amp;B.  If you don’t know about the Bay Area’s role in hip hop radio history, please go check into KMEL/Sway &amp; King Tech and that era!</p>

<p><strong>The Thizzler</strong><br />
I’m sure there are other hip hop blogs dedicated to Bay Area hip hop but The Thizzler is the first one I knew of and one that has done a great job of promoting our music.  What started as Matt Werner’s personal blog now reports shows, introduces Bay Area Freshmen, releases mixtapes and more.  If a Bay artist releases a new track, I will bet that The Thizzler will let you know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Today’s Future Sound</strong><br />
These are the guys creating the next generation of Bay Area musicians. And the one after that. The Oakland based organization teaches music production, beat making and DJing to youth around the Bay Area. In fact they have put on workshops all over the country and executive director Dr. Elliot Gann recently traveled to Senegal for a program on conflict resolution and diplomacy in partnership with the State Department and the University of North Carolina. TFS hopes to further their mission based in the belief in “the power of music to transform and inspire youth to create positive change in their lives and communities.”</p>

The day I found out, I nearly fell out of my chair. I offered to do anything to help... serve bagels, pour coffee, etc.... whatever it took. That's exactly what I did (at the rather ungodly hour of 7am!)To be in a room with just a couple hundred lucky fans... and Bowie... was amazing. I also decided to be brave and brought along my copies of Ziggy Stardust and The Hunger soundtrack on vinyl. Having only worked here at Slim's a few months, I had no idea if I might be crossing any lines, but I was ready. So ready.</p>
<p>The interview &amp; performance were (of course) amazing. A car was parked and waiting in the alley and Bowie was soon to leave. I knew I had the green light when Dawn said "if you're going to do it, now is the time." I met him at the top of the stairs, said hello, thanked him for a wonderful morning and asked if he wouldn't mind signing my records. He joked that he had never seen The Hunger on vinyl - so of course I offered him my copy. Thankfully I got to keep it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was one of the best days... ever. I think of that morning quite often. The audio of that amazing morning surfaced on YouTube a couple of years ago and I've made it a habit of posting it on FB every year for his birthday.</p>
<p>Thank you, David Bowie, for... everything.</p>

Known in the Bay Area for their often raucous shows, Whiskerman is a Bay Area band that gives us hope for local live music (*please don't move to L.A.!). Now, with<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><i>NOMAD</i>, their new album produced by Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, Dept of Eagles), there’s no holding back. Whiskerman has taken to lush string arrangements framing bold prophetic lyricism in their most recent effort. Fronted by Singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Graham Patzner, Whiskerman utilizes the structure of a classic rock band to convey a timeless familiarity, luring the listener into a new mythological landscape with a story for our time. The songs of<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><i>NOMAD</i><span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>were written through the anxiety and uncertainty constantly revealing itself in our society towards the collapse of industrial civilization. Somehow they manage to make it all sound so catchy.</p>
<p>Whiskerman has gone through basically all of the growing pains a band can go through from their folkier self titled first album to their soul driven EP,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><i>BAD NEWS<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></i>Produced by Tony Berg<i>.<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></i>Drummer Nick Cobbett, Lead Guitarist/Sitarist Charles Lloyd and Bass player Will Lawrence, all active members of this growing machine for 5 years, bring a tight groove, powerful dynamics and virtuosic chops to the landscape of Patzner’s songs. They finally found a match in Jeff Saltzman, who worked closely with the band to push them from their rock and roll backbone into a grander more symphonic sound. Working with their new label, OIM Records, the momentum and ambition continues to grow for this humble quartet.</p>
<p>On Friday January 8 at Great American Music Hall, Whiskerman will have their Album Release Party. Featuring Papa Bear and the Easy Love &amp; Scary Little Friends - 2 more Bay Area bands that keep the flame burning, deep inside San Francisco.</p>
