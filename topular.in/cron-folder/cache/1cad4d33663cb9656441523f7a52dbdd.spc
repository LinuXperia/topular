On New Year's Eve I wanted to make a special meal for some dear friends. While my menu may seem complicated I can assure you it was all easy to make. In fact, I was seeing patients the morning of New Year's Eve. Here was my menu:<strong>
</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1885 aligncenter" alt="New Years Eve Menu" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2016/02/New-Years-Eve-Menu-e1454781812329-294x300.jpg" width="294" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I served the appetizers one at a time. While I was able to make the deviled eggs earlier, the scallops and shrimp had to be made at that time. No worries, these cook quickly plus it not only gave me the opportunity to have my girlfriends help me in the kitchen, but we were able to catch up on things that the men just were not interested in.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The dinner was a success. While I enjoyed every dish, by far my favorite was the berry tiramisu dessert. This dessert is light and so incredibly tasty with all those fresh berries. For those that dislike the traditional tiramisu with coffee and cocoa, this is the perfect alternative. The best news about this recipe is that it can easily be made gluten-free by substituting  gluten-free ladyfingers. Shhh, I made mine gluten-free and no one could tell the difference.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">INGREDIENTS</h4>
(1) 12 ounce package of unsweetened frozen berries

(1) 12 ounce package or container of frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed

1/3 cup of raspberry liquor (inexpensive one is fine)

12 tablespoons sugar

3 packages of ladyfingers or 2 packages of <a href="http://www.schar.com/en-us/products/us-cookies/ladyfingers" target="_blank">Schar gluten-free ladyfingers</a> (sold in grocery stores)

(2) 8 ounce containers of mascarpone Italian cheese (typically sold in the specialty cheese section)

1 cup of chilled whipping cream

2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, divided

1 cup thinly sliced strawberries, divided

(2) 6 ounce packages of raspberries, divided

(1) 1/2 pint of blueberries, divided
<h4>DIRECTIONS</h4>
Using a heavy saucepan, cook the frozen mixed berries and 6 tablespoons of sugar over medium heat. Stir frequently until the mixture is reduced and matches the consistency of jam. This should take approximately 15 minutes. Cool mixture.

While the mixed fruit is cooking, take the thawed raspberries and drain into a small bowl. Use a spoon to press on the raspberries to get all the juice. Throw away the raspberry solids. Add 1/3 cup of raspberry liquor to the raspberry liquid and stir.

Using a sharp knife (I used a serrated one) cut a ladyfinger to the length 3 inches. Quickly dip the cut ladyfinger into the syrup and place the flat side against the springform side, rounded side facing up. Repeat this procedure until the side is all covered. Now dip the ladyfingers and cover the entire bottom. You may need to trim some in order to fit. Set aside.

While the be berry mixture is cooling, add the mascarpone cheese, 4 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract into a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, whisk the mixture until it is blended and creamy. Set aside.

In another bowl, whisk the chilled whipping cream, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Begin whisking on low until the cream begins to take some form then increase the speed to high. Once stiff peaks are formed (when raise the whisk, a peak will form and hold its shape) stop whisking. Check frequently, you don't want to make butter by whisking too much. Fold the whipped cream mixture into the mascarpone cheese.

To assemble, spread half the jam mixture over the bottom layer of the ladyfingers. Now spoon half of the cheese mixture over the top and gently spread it making sure to cover all the areas. Sprinkle half of the blueberries, raspberries, and 1/2 cup of the strawberries all over the top, . Put the rest of the fruit in the refrigerator.

Dip the ladyfingers in the syrup mixture and layer over the fruit. Again, you may need to trim some ladyfingers to fit. Spread the remaining jam over the ladyfingers. Spoon the remaining cheese mixture over the jam and spread to completely cover. Cover the springform pan and place in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. I like having it sit overnight before serving so that all the flavors have a longer time to blend.

When ready to serve, using a plastic knife, carefully go around the springform pan side so that it will not stick when releasing the pan. Release the pan and decorate the top of the cake with the remaining fruit. Now you are ready to serve and enjoy this delicious variation of tiramisu.

I have one question, why? People do not have the same reaction when they hear the term diabetes, obesity, stroke…I can go on. Diabetes and depression have a lot in common…after all both are due to an imbalance of chemicals—insulin for diabetes and ones such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine for depression. You know what, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

Because of this stigma, people are afraid to seek help because they are afraid of being labeled “crazy”. The only “crazy” thing is that the stigma continues and that makes me very sad and angry. There are so many people that could be getting the help they need if it weren’t for this. I cannot tell you how many people I see who come in for their physical and if it weren’t for the fact that I ask about their mood, they would never share with me that they are feeling depressed. I have even had instances of asking and they say they are fine then proceed to cry and admit that they have been depressed for a long time. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1875" alt="enough is enough" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2016/01/enough-is-enough1.jpg" width="179" height="179" /></a>I do not have any problem asking my patients about depression, substance abuse, anxiety---any uncomfortable topic. Sure, it would be easier for me not to but is that fair to the patient? If I do not bring up the subject, and patients are afraid to bring up the subject, then everyone suffers. The patient suffers, the patient’s overall health suffers, and the patient’s relationships suffer. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

While there is less of a stigma than there was 10 years ago, this stigma still exists. I have thought long and hard to figure out how to abolish this. Again, most have no problem telling just about anyone that they have diabetes yet I do not know many that would say to someone “Well, I was just diagnosed with mental illness.” We have the ice bucket challenge for ALS, the many walks/charity events for cancer that millions of people participate in, but mental illness? I am sure there must be campaigns for mental illness too but nothing comes to mind because mental illness has a stigma. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

I have one question, why? People do not have the same reaction when they hear the term diabetes, obesity, stroke…I can go on. Diabetes and depression have a lot in common…after all both are due to an imbalance of chemicals—insulin for diabetes and ones such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine for depression. You know what, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

Because of this stigma, people are afraid to seek help because they are afraid of being labeled “crazy”. The only “crazy” thing is that the stigma continues and that makes me very sad and angry. There are so many people that could be getting the help they need if it weren’t for this. I cannot tell you how many people I see who come in for their physical and if it weren’t for the fact that I ask about their mood, they would never share with me that they are feeling depressed. I have even had instances of asking and they say they are fine then proceed to cry and admit that they have been depressed for a long time. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

This love affair with food was the catalyst for me to learn how to cook for the pleasure of it, not just for sustenance.

The truth is that gourmet food does not have to be overly expensive, it does not have to be found only in the best restaurants, and it most definitely does not have to be difficult to make.

When I go to a restaurant for the "food experience" I try not to order something that I prepare at home because I like to experience different foods or preparations. Now that I am gluten-free, it is always refreshing finding new food experiences.

A couple of months ago I went out to an Italian restaurant and their nightly special was peppers stuffed with Italian sausage and risotto. As I took each delicious bite, all I could think of was when I was going to make these at home. I finally made these last week and they were such a hit that I wanted to share the recipe with you.

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</span></h3>
4 large bell peppers--any color

1 pound of bulk Italian sausage--either mild or hot (I love the hot)

1 cup Arborio Rice (Risotto)

4 cups chicken broth, warmed

1/2 cup white wine (not a sweet one)*

1 TBS butter

1 TBS vegetable oil

1 medium onion diced

2 cloves garlic minced

1/2 tsp basil

1/2 tsp oregano

1/2 tsp salt

Fresh ground pepper to taste

1/4 cup grated pecorino cheese

1/2 cup grated mozzarella cheese

3 cups of <a title="Marinara Sauce" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/marinara-sauce-2/">marina sauce</a> or 1 jar of your favorite
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directions</span></h3>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees

Cut peppers lengthwise in half, remove seeds and its membrane. Leave stem on if you want a nice presentation.

Rub peppers with oil, place peppers with skins facing up in a 13 x 9 pan. Bake for 15 minutes or until peppers are beginning to soften. Remove pan from oven and take out the peppers. Put 2 1/2 cups of marinara sauce in the pan, put peppers back in with the inside facing up.

In a skillet over medium heat, saute onions and garlic until soft. Add in Italian sausage, basil, oregano, and salt. Break up the sausage into small pieces with a spatula. Cook until sausage is no longer pink. Set aside.

Place broth into a sauce pan and heat until hot, but not boiling.  Keep on simmer so it stays hot.

In another skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium heat. Once the mixture is hot, add in the arborio rice and saute for 1 to 2 minutes until you smell a nutty aroma. Do not brown. Add in the white wine. Stir until it is absorbed.

Once absorbed, put one ladle of broth into the rice. Stir frequently until it is absorbed. Continue to add broth one ladle at a time, stirring frequently, until all the broth is absorbed. You will notice the risotto getting creamier. Taste to make sure it is soft. Most of the time it requires the full 4 cups, sometimes a bit less. Remove from the heat.

Add the sausage mixture, cheeses, and 1/2 cup of the marina sauce to the risotto and stir well. Add ground pepper to taste.

Spoon mixture into each pepper. Cover pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for an addional ten minutes.

When serving, place a pepper on a plate and spoon over some of the marina sauce from the pan. Please let me know how you like it.

Taking this concept a step forward, if the “Easy Button" was possible then imagine if the infamous "magic wand" existed and once waved all wishes came true. Fantasizing these two things is fine, believing they have these supernatural powers is, well, outlandish.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1833" alt="magic wand" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/12/magic-wand-300x300.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a>While life would be so much easier if these two things actually did exist, I am glad they do not. I know that comes to a surprise to many of you, especially with everything I have experienced.  I have had kidney cancer, have chronic medical conditions that continues to affect my quality of life, I developed post traumatic stress disorder from my son’s health crisis...I could go on but I think you get my point. Yes, waving a wand to take away all these things would have been wonderful, however, what I took away from these life experiences were life changing to me in a positive way.

The truth is that I have learned so much from these hardships. Before these events the word "tomorrow" was used more often than the word "today". When I talked to or saw any of my family members and if I forgot to say "I love you" at the end of our visit, I thought that I would just tell them tomorrow. I do not do that anymore. I make sure they know I love them each and every time I talk to them.

Two years ago I started to write a letter to my sons on their birthday. This letter expresses how much I love them, how they make me proud, and some advice I have for them that I have learned throughout my life. I believe it is important to tell those that you love how they make a difference in your life. I mail this letter to them so that they have something tangible that they could always refer to if they ever feel the need to be with me, even when I am no longer here. While I am not planning on leaving this world any time soon, life sometimes has a different plan.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/12/being-strong-quote.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1836 aligncenter" alt="being strong quote" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/12/being-strong-quote.jpg" width="236" height="236" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I learned that I am a strong woman. I refuse to let these tough times overshadow all the good in my life. Do I sometimes go through "woe is me" days--of course, I am human. But I also work hard on reminding myself that I am strong and can make it through anything because I have made it through so much and still have my family, my friends, my sense of humor, my life.</p>
I do not want that magic wand or easy button. I hope that you can look at your life and find the strength from all your experiences whether they are good or difficult. However, if you do choose to buy one if it ever becomes available, can I maybe borrow it just once?

Taking this concept a step forward, if the “Easy Button" was possible then imagine if the infamous "magic wand" existed and once waved all wishes came true. Fantasizing these two things is fine, believing they have these supernatural powers is, well, outlandish.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1833" alt="magic wand" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/12/magic-wand-300x300.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a>While life would be so much easier if these two things actually did exist, I am glad they do not. I know that comes to a surprise to many of you, especially with everything I have experienced.  I have had kidney cancer, have chronic medical conditions that continues to affect my quality of life, I developed post traumatic stress disorder from my son’s health crisis...I could go on but I think you get my point. Yes, waving a wand to take away all these things would have been wonderful, however, what I took away from these life experiences were life changing to me in a positive way.

The truth is that I have learned so much from these hardships. Before these events the word "tomorrow" was used more often than the word "today". When I talked to or saw any of my family members and if I forgot to say "I love you" at the end of our visit, I thought that I would just tell them tomorrow. I do not do that anymore. I make sure they know I love them each and every time I talk to them.

Two years ago I started to write a letter to my sons on their birthday. This letter expresses how much I love them, how they make me proud, and some advice I have for them that I have learned throughout my life. I believe it is important to tell those that you love how they make a difference in your life. I mail this letter to them so that they have something tangible that they could always refer to if they ever feel the need to be with me, even when I am no longer here. While I am not planning on leaving this world any time soon, life sometimes has a different plan.
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/12/being-strong-quote.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1836 aligncenter" alt="being strong quote" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/12/being-strong-quote.jpg" width="236" height="236" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I learned that I am a strong woman. I refuse to let these tough times overshadow all the good in my life. Do I sometimes go through "woe is me" days--of course, I am human. But I also work hard on reminding myself that I am strong and can make it through anything because I have made it through so much and still have my family, my friends, my sense of humor, my life.</p>
I do not want that magic wand or easy button. I hope that you can look at your life and find the strength from all your experiences whether they are good or difficult. However, if you do choose to buy one if it ever becomes available, can I maybe borrow it just once?

Growing up, I loved Erma Bombeck. Even though are ages were separated by many years, me a naive teenager, her a middle aged woman, we both found humor in everyday life. I remember seeing her on some television show where she was talking about life and made it funny--even the difficult stuff.

I remember using her saying "If life were a bowl of cherries, what am I doing in the pits" whenever something went wrong--which was often--and made me feel just a little bit better. She was full of so many sayings all of which I could relate to. Some of my other favorites  are,  “Seize the moment. Remember all those women on the 'Titanic' who waved off the dessert cart” and “When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, 'I used everything you gave me.”

Little did I know back then that Erma Bombeck and Nancy Chodash would share the same philosophy. Live to the fullest, fulfill your dreams and no regrets because tomorrow doesn't come for everyone.

Empathy is the ability to step into the shoe of someone else and understand and share in those same feelings. This is different from sympathy which means to feel bad or pity someone's misfortune.  Why do some people lack empathy while others have a wealth of it? I do not know the answer but I believe <strong>most</strong> people are born with the capacity for empathy which further develops by nurturing and life experiences. I also believe empathy can be learned. For example, when a child is hurt, sad, or scared and having someone to comfort them helps that child learn to comfort others in distress. Discussing with children when someone is being victimized or discussing how that person must feel also helps cultivate this important trait in facilitating a successful personal and professional life.

Maybe I was born with a gigantic capacity for empathy but I also know my life experiences only furthered its development. When I was young I was made fun of because I had red hair and I wore glasses at a young age--kids can be so mean. When I see/hear bullying I still get a pit in my stomach. I worked in my father's podiatry office when I was growing up, I loved helping people and knew that medicine was my calling.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/"><img class=" wp-image-1798 aligncenter" alt="empathy" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/11/empathy-300x150.gif" width="270" height="135" /></a></p>
Being a health care provider and seeing so much in my career further fostered my empathy, however, having my own health issues and enduring the frustration of medicine as a patient was probably most significant influence to me. When I see my patients looking scared and feeling alone...I understand those feelings, I have been there, and I just want to help. I wish I had the magic wand, I wish I could "fix" it but I am not always able to. What I can do is let them know they are not alone and that I understand. While it may not cure them, it does offer comfort.

I stated earlier that sometimes I am cursed by having too much empathy. Yes, there are times I wish I could not "feel" so much, however, this is who I am and I would not change it. Sometimes it takes a toll on my mental health but then I remind myself that I am blessed to have empathy. I am not perfect, I do not always have the answers, but I able to understand the feelings of others which makes me a better mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend and provider. While some of my life experiences have been difficult, I would never trade them because they have made me who I am today, and I am okay with that.

I fell in love with baseball when I was 8 because of the Chicago Cubs. I remember watching the games on WGN TV channel 9 with my younger brother.

Looking back, I am a bit shocked that my parents let me do that, but I am glad they did. I knew all the players, all the rules and even brought my mitt with me hoping to get a ball. Yep, I was a tomboy and proud of it!

I never had anything against the Chicago White Sox, they just are not my type. It's the Chicago Cubs that give me that loving feeling and makes me want to be with them in both good and bad times. I do not know what the future will bring but I do know that this year the Chicago Cubs have made me proud--they have surpassed all my expectations for the year. No matter what happens during this post season they are already a winner in my book. You know, this year they remind me of when I watched my sons play baseball... a bunch of young guys having fun. <strong>Go Cubs Go!</strong>

What does that mean, you ask? Once a month, ChicagoNow bloggers have one hour to create a post and all must publish at the same time. The topic this month is to write about sleep and its impact on my life...well here I go!

I used to love to sleep. Before I had children I could sleep for hours and hours and through any kind of noise...thunderstorm, phone ringing, maybe even a siren. There is a reason why a woman is pregnant for 9 full months, to get ready for the lack of uninterrupted sleep. Sure, in the first trimester I was tired all the time and slept like a log, however, by the last trimester I had to wake up just to turn plus I had to go to the bathroom 1,000 times. I suppose this was my body getting ready for the fragmented sleep I would endure after giving birth.

I could hear every cry when they were infants and as they grew older and went out with friends, I was not able to fall into a deeper sleep until they were safely home.

Now my children are grown and live out of the house. One would think that a great sleep would be easily remembered and conquered, like riding a bicycle, however, there are too many obstacles--can you say menopause?

I then lay in bed convincing myself that sleep is really overrated, as I listen to my husband snore. You know, if I could sleep I think I know what I would dream about...wishing I could borrow my husband's testicles because he seems to be able to sleep through everything.

<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
2 boneless chicken breasts*
1 1/2 cups Italian bread crumbs or gluten-free Italian panko breadcrumbs put on a plate
1 egg, beaten
1 tsp water
2 large garlic clove, minced
1 green pepper, julienned
1 red pepper, julienned
1 medium onion, julienned
4 ounces sliced mushrooms
1 cup white wine (they sell bottles of white cooking wine or use your favorite one that is not sweet)
Juice of one small lemon
1 tsp basil
1 tsp oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt or more to taste
Ground pepper to taste
1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil for shallow frying

[caption id="attachment_1745" align="aligncenter" width="216"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/08/cut-up-veg.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1745  " alt="You can use any colored peppers, I like the yellow ones too." src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/08/cut-up-veg-300x168.jpg" width="216" height="121" /></a> You can use any colored peppers, I like the yellow ones too.[/caption]

*If chicken breasts are thick I cut lengthwise to make 2 pieces with even thickness. You can also pound the chicken breasts to equal thickness.
<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Mix egg and water until combined. Dip one breast in egg wash and then coat both sides with the breadcrumbs. Put aside until all breasts are coated.</li>
	<li>Heat large skillet (12" diameter) over medium heat until a few drops of water quickly sizzle off the pan and evaporates. Now add the 1/3 cup oil and swirl the pan to evenly coat the bottom. <strong>Do not do this with a nonstick pan since heating without oil will let off toxins. If using a nonstick pan, heat the oil in the pan for 2 minutes.</strong></li>
	<li>Place breasts in the oil and cook one side until lightly browned, approximately 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until lightly browned too. Depending on the number of chicken pieces you have, you may need to add a little more oil in the pan.</li>
	<li>Place the sauteed breasts on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb excess oil.</li>
	<li>If needed, drain olive oil to leave approximately 2 tablespoons.</li>
	<li>Make sure the oil is still hot and add the onion, garlic, peppers, and mushrooms to the pan. Season with basil, salt, oregano, and pepper. Saute for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, stirring the vegetables frequently until the vegetables are beginning to brown slightly.</li>
	<li>Now place the chicken on the bottom of the saute pan and put the sauteed vegetables on the top of the chicken. Pour the white wine and the lemon juice over the chicken. Cover pan and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>

For some serving suggestions, you can serve over rice or pasta, however, I like making sauteed spinach with garlic and serving over that. Please let me know how you like this recipe, I promise you that you will not be disappointed!

*If chicken breasts are thick I cut lengthwise to make 2 pieces with even thickness. You can also pound the chicken breasts to equal thickness.
<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Mix egg and water until combined. Dip one breast in egg wash and then coat both sides with the breadcrumbs. Put aside until all breasts are coated.</li>
	<li>Heat large skillet (12" diameter) over medium heat until a few drops of water quickly sizzle off the pan and evaporates. Now add the 1/3 cup oil and swirl the pan to evenly coat the bottom. <strong>Do not do this with a nonstick pan since heating without oil will let off toxins. If using a nonstick pan, heat the oil in the pan for 2 minutes.</strong></li>
	<li>Place breasts in the oil and cook one side until lightly browned, approximately 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until lightly browned too. Depending on the number of chicken pieces you have, you may need to add a little more oil in the pan.</li>
	<li>Place the sauteed breasts on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb excess oil.</li>
	<li>If needed, drain olive oil to leave approximately 2 tablespoons.</li>
	<li>Make sure the oil is still hot and add the onion, garlic, peppers, and mushrooms to the pan. Season with basil, salt, oregano, and pepper. Saute for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, stirring the vegetables frequently until the vegetables are beginning to brown slightly.</li>
	<li>Now place the chicken on the bottom of the saute pan and put the sauteed vegetables on the top of the chicken. Pour the white wine and the lemon juice over the chicken. Cover pan and reduce heat to simmer. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>

For some serving suggestions, you can serve over rice or pasta, however, I like making sauteed spinach with garlic and serving over that. Please let me know how you like this recipe, I promise you that you will not be disappointed!

What does that mean, you ask? Once a month, ChicagoNow bloggers have one hour to create a post and all must publish at the same time. The topic this month is to write about a time I lost my temper--well, here I go...

There are numerous reasons why people lose their temper but they all stem from one common element--anger that becomes so overpowering that all emotional control is lost. I do not lose my temper often, not because I do not get angry, but because I hate losing control of anything in my life, especially my emotions.
<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1734" alt="baby-temper" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/nancys-world/files/2015/07/baby-temper-195x300.jpeg" width="156" height="240" /></a>
Most of the time after losing my temper I feel embarrassed by the fact that I could not reel in my emotions. Losing my temper only feels good for a very short time because I could blow off steam, but it rarely benefits the situation at hand. There was one time, however, that my outburst caused my son and I to have a special moment.

I do not tolerate anyone slamming a door in anger. I have 2 children, both who learned at a young age that this behavior was not acceptable. If a door was slammed, I would tell them that they obviously do not know how to open or close it properly and that they would have to practice 20 times so that they could learn. I am pretty certain that each of my children only slammed a door a couple of times when they were young.

One day I was really stressed about something. I remember going upstairs and looking into my high school son's room and all I could see was a mess. Clothes all over, dirty dishes, I could not even see the carpeting.I had asked him to clean his room for a couple days yet a tornado going through his room could only improve it. Suddenly I just lost it. I yelled and I may even stomped my feet and then I did the unthinkable...I slammed his door.

I made it down the stairs when I hear him yell down...Mom, you obviously do not know how to open and close a door. Please come up here and practice by doing it 20 times. I looked up at him, thought for a second, and I realized that I too should have the same consequences for my poor behavior. I went upstairs, opened and closed the door 20 times, we both laughed, and he preceded to clean his room. We both learned an important lesson that day all because of my lack of emotional control. He learned how to defuse a situation and I learned that my children actually listen to me preach and that I must practice what I preach.
