Translated, that means she is working a lot more for the same paycheck. OK, she received a bit of an increase this year, but her first love and most important vocation continues to be spoiling grandchildren. We’re also happy to celebrate her five year survivor milestone on December 10th! Myself? I had a little adventure leasing one of the Modern Photo warehouses to the homeless who live outside all year. Enlightening? Frustrating? Political? Depressing? Uh, yes. I was so busy during the 2 ½ months I caught a case of walking pneumonia, but didn’t stop to see the doctor until the end of the ordeal. I survived and the homeless issue endures. Stay tuned. There is more to that story.</span></div><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Kyle still lives in Brooklyn unless he is traveling around the country doing video productions for a number of networks. He put nearly a year of time and effort into producing a wonderful CBS show on the Army/Navy football game played in 1963, just two weeks after the JFK assassination.

This July, he joined an orthopedic group outside of St. Louis as their pain management physician. Brooke has been busy doing a facelift on the home they moved to in Ladue. When she finishes, she plans on having another set of twins. Just kidding Brookie. Meanwhile, Parker (6) is conquering kindergarten and exploring a career in either sales or publishing with his first entrepreneurial effort...selling a comic book he wrote. Twin sis, Finley, is the budding artist and MiMi’s (a.ka. Julie’s) best friend. They have a real bond. Harry, almost four, just has fun. He lives in the moment. He’s what I want to be. Too late?

I've been busy-really busy. About three years ago I went back to the family biz after an 18 month hiatus to close it. That was not what I hope to do twenty years ago, but I'll spare you the details. It needed to be done. I thought I could do it in three to six months, but I couldn't have been more wrong. It continues.<br /><br />&nbsp;I filed a final tax return, paid the final invoices, continue to pay insurance premiums just in case someone came out of the woodwork with a scheme to sue me. But, the federal, state, and local governments want me to continue to pay up as we have for the past fifty-plus years. So, I keep biking (It's easier than parking a car)over to the City-County building, Indiana Statehouse, and the Homer Capehart (I met the goober during high school at the State Fair) Federal Building to show them that Modern Photo Offset Supply, Inc. was dead, dissolved, defunct, and that I am dizzy trying.   Nevertheless, the "official" letters continue. I paid an invoice from the feds last month for unemployment insurance for the last two months for the last two employees. They wanted $19.45 and another tax return while proving that I was deader than the Wicked Witch of the West. I sent a vial of blood as a bonus just in case.<br /><br />&nbsp;Where am I now? My two brothers and I still own the real estate that will be worth something someday. My wife still continues to achieve even though all she wants to do is be a teacher. My sons are incredible. All three are doing meaningful work. Me? I'm a grinder. I made a good living doing something most people never understood nor cared about. My grandchildren are smart and beautiful. And, I am financially secure assuming I do not live to 103 years of age. I am a truly blessed man.<br /><br />&nbsp;Oh, my dog Wrigley loves me, too. </div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2013/09/now-what.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2013-09-20T20:11:25.946-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-32422955305321032";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 20:41:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Twenty-Ten";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4289:"I’ve lived more years than books I’ve read.

We traveled to Hutchison Island (FL) to see Guy &  Marilyn, St. Louis multiple times to hold Finley, Parker, and our new grand baby Harrison-born 12/28/09, Cabo to antagonize our good friend Joey, San Francisco to experience new things with Jo & Joel, southwestern Michigan to antagonize Joey some more, north of Seattle to attempt being nice to Joey at her daughter’s wedding, Hawaii to see if Joey would actually pick us up at the airport, Napa (not the auto parts store) for an incredible weekend with Joel, Jo and Jo’s parents, St. Francis Hospital, and before the year ends, to Toronto.  Now, you’re probably wondering why I have included St. Francis as a travel destination. Well, that would be the same reason you take your Ferrari to get a tune-up every time it rains. You see, Julie’s mother is 99, approaching her 100th birthday in May 2011 and she just needed to have her bolts tightened up and fluids topped off four times this past summer. When you are a high performance vintage machine, a little maintenance is required. VROOOM!<br /><br />As for our three amigos, life has been kind, yet challenging for each of them. Kyle had a BIG year. He met an incredible woman in NYC named Casey, a.k.a. Cupcake, a nickname she earned at Joel’s wedding. After she finished her hand surgery fellowship, they decided to move back to her neck of the Canadian woods in August to a little town named Toronto. They just became engaged over the Thanksgiving weekend! Sorry ladies, he is our last available son. Kyle is learning the travails of being an ex-patriot and Casey is very busy starting her practice. <br /><br />Oh, did I mention Joel is married? He tied the knot May 1st with a remarkable lady, Jo Chien, in the Santa Cruz Mountains!  All who attended are sure that they will never again experience such a wedding and reception... which included the Stanford Dollies dancing to the Stanford  “Scatter” Marching Band, a show choir routine, a bhangra dance. an amazing Kyle-produced video and lots of overflowing laughter and love. If there had been an earthquake, I would not have felt it. Jo is an academic breast oncologist at UCSF and Joel continues to do well at Google.  We returned in October to spend the weekend with the two of them and Jo’s delightful parents, David & Chia-Chia, to visit Marin County and Napa. It is such a beautiful part of the country. I can see why people want to live there in spite of the taxes and the Terminator. If I had to work again, it would be a joy to work for/under/over/around either of them. It’s safe to say, “I’m not qualified”.<br /><br />Brian, Brooke, and our three grand kids are doing what a family does when Dad is in his third year of anesthesiology residency. Brian works long and extra hours, their phenomenal Mom improvises and optimizes the resources they have, and the kids stay healthy while loving Mom & Dad. It sounds like a simple formula, but it has a lot of moving parts. So, if the federal government wants to find a way to fix its finances, they should call Brooke. If it wants to show it cares, they should call Brian. If the government is looking for its future, the kids will be there to straighten things out in about twenty years. <br /><br />In closing, just like the Thunderbolt Kid, we have a great family, live in a great country, can freely worship our God, have great friends, the opportunity to grow, learn from our mistakes, and live a bountiful life. I could go on and on, so please read the book so I can keep this letter to one page and a 44 cent stamp. I’m not cheap, but I am German. Anyway, I gotta go. Julie is coming home soon from another easy day at IUPUI and I have so many things to do. She has no idea what it takes to run a household!<br /><br /><br />                                   Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2010/12/twenty-ten.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2010-12-17T15:46:59.996-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"127";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-7630398517547009824";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 05 Jun 2010 10:08:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Remodeling";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Kitchen Remodeling";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2623:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/TAo2dUAcgfI/AAAAAAAAAH4/n9JDxz9WU8E/s1600/lowes_masthead_logo.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 146px; height: 71px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/TAo2dUAcgfI/AAAAAAAAAH4/n9JDxz9WU8E/s320/lowes_masthead_logo.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5479251773864313330" /></a><br />We live (when we aren't sleeping) in our kitchen, so I imagine if you are going to splurge, it might as well be where you keep your pots & pans. <br /><br />My first kitchen re-do happened in 1972. I was fresh out of college and had no business getting a house, but my father helped me buy one. He had just hired me as a neophyte and he liked his salesmen in debt. Anyway, the house needed some TLC and my idea of remodeling was a gallon of paint and a couple of scratch & dent appliances. Done! How nice does a kitchen need to be to grill a hamburger and fry a breaded tenderloin?<br /><br />Then, I got married. I was able to keep the genie in the bottle by buying new homes over the next 36 years which had nice kitchens, but never "the kitchen". Then, I weakened. I let the genie out to help us buy some new counter tops. The levies were breached! It became a total tear out.<br /><br />After kicking the tires at a couple of kitchen "specialists" (a.k.a. "We know you have a wife and we are going to take ALL of your money") we ended up at Lowes where the corporate saying is "Let's build something together". The only thing I was building was some marital tension. Let's just say I lost the argument two months earlier when I mumbled "counter tops".<br /><br />So, for the past month we have been living in transition. Julie has been packing her lunch pail heading off to the salt mine while I have been babysitting the contractors while "We are building something together". First, I need to say that everyone involved has been very nice and knowledgeable with their assigned tasks. However, this must be the industry were they employ all of the adults with attention deficit disorder. They show up late, leave frequently, forget necessary items, and generally make a German-heritage obsessive compulsive person like myself-NUTS!<br /><br />We are now in our 6th week. Our kitchen is functional, but not yet finished. Most of what is left is cosmetic stuff that should be done by the end of the week. But now, the Mrs. is changing the room colors. That is equivalent to BP trying to find a new way to stop "The Leak". I'm betting BP will finish first.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2010/06/kitchen-remodeling.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2010-06-05T08:30:17.820-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:103:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/TAo2dUAcgfI/AAAAAAAAAH4/n9JDxz9WU8E/s72-c/lowes_masthead_logo.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-9113885973552110941";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 05 May 2010 13:18:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Guardian Angels";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3067:"<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/S-Lh1SGY0bI/AAAAAAAAAHo/zWhh7IwJ5P0/s1600/Angel+Wings.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 104px; height: 104px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/S-Lh1SGY0bI/AAAAAAAAAHo/zWhh7IwJ5P0/s200/Angel+Wings.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468181203089150386" /></a><br />My dear Mom who passed away due to cancer in 1987 believed in guardian angels. She always felt that our family had been protected by a power greater than our own common sense. Most likely she was right. Our family has been blessed with good fortune for years. It's not that we haven't had our share of challenges, but when we needed divine intervention things have worked out.<br /><br />Anyway, when Mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer she was needless to say greatly disappointed that she would not be on this Earth to see her grandchildren grow up. So, in her last months she promised her six children that she would be the Meek clan's guardian angel. Most people would think that was a sweet gesture and then would forget about it.<br /><br />However, Mom frequently sends reminders she is watching over us.<br /><br />For example, two years ago at Brian and Brooke's wedding rehearsal dinner on the beach at Daufuskie Island, a double rainbow rose up above the ocean as I was toasting their marriage. And last week, in the Santa Cruz Mountains on a perfectly calm day, as Jo and Joel stepped forward to the spot where they would become a couple forever, a breeze blew directly through them raising the veil on Jo's dress. I looked around us and nothing else was moving. The redwoods were still, the lake was calm, and my eyes were wet. Julie, Nancy, Donna and Joe also interpreted this veil-lifting breeze as Mom's presence. It was just Mom's way of telling us she was there.<br /><br />The rest of the day was equally remarkable. but I would refer you to Brooke's blog at www.thethreeolives.com. She captured the moments beautifully.<br /><br />Needing, but not wanting to, Julie and I took off Monday morning on separate flights (to save a couple hundred bucks) and I had the pleasure of being on the same flight as Julio and Marilyn Fernandez. I've known Marilyn since carhops were on roller skates, so we had quite a chat. Nevertheless, my flight was routine and arrived on time in Indy. I contacted Julie and confirmed she was on time in Chicago an hour behind me. When my phone rang at her scheduled arrival time I assumed she was on the runway in Indy, but that was not the case. Her plane had returned to Chicago to make an emergency landing. The plane had lost the computer that controlled the landing gear. The crew went into full emergency mode just like the "Miracle on the Hudson" only this one was on concrete. Julie thought she was going to die. But the back-up computer worked, the landing gear came down and she eventually returned home safely on a different plane.<br /><br />Mom was there.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2010/05/guardian-angels.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2010-05-06T17:29:15.029-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:95:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/S-Lh1SGY0bI/AAAAAAAAAHo/zWhh7IwJ5P0/s72-c/Angel+Wings.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-1197318212193833477";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 Apr 2010 00:07:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"10 Things That Make Old Men Grumpy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:417:"1) When they realize that they are older than AskIndyTed<br />2) Women (except Mom)<br />3) Taxes (see #4)<br />4) Obama <br />5) Pencil-necked bosses whose only skill is producing spreadsheets<br />6) Rush hour traffic <br />7) Liberals (see #4)<br />8) Going to work when you don't care anymore<br />9) When your favorite college football team loses the BCS Championship <br />10)Infrequent blog posts by AskIndyTed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2010/04/10-things-that-make-old-men-grumpy.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2010-04-27T09:19:39.387-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-7198391032882771322";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 24 Apr 2010 15:07:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Blog Block";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1471:"Some have asked why I haven't posted recently. Well, it hasn't been for lack of material. With taxes (property, inheritance, income,sales, VAT, etc.), healthcare reform, financial reform, government deficits (local, state, federal, and any sovereign nation without an oil well), and dog-owners not picking up their best friend's #2, I could have posted daily.  But, who really wants to hear about all of that negative noise.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all of these happenings have affected my mood to write. I needed inspiration, a lightening bolt, a sign from the heavens, stronger coffee...Something! I was neither depressed nor inspired. I was mired in winter, another miserable season of basketball from IU and the Indiana Tax Pirates, uh Pacers. The Colts didn't show up for the Super Bowl, but Julie's bronchitis did-twice. Personally, my life was fine, but things around me were kind of out of kilter, broken, busted, out-of-time, cattywhompus, in a fog, screwed up, and otherwise sliding sideways. <br /><br />Well, it's time to fill my BVD's up with ice and snap out of it, throw some cold water in my face, and a whiff of smelling salts!

I would guess not, since it is rare to see more than a few folks camped in front of any of the nine screens, regardless of the movie. If movie theaters across the country are struggling to fill the seats, this one is in a coma on life support. <div><br /></div><div>So, why would my sweetie and I frequent a place where so few tread? The obvious reason would be the proximity from where we live which is less than a mile. We can walk if the weather is nice or drive and park for free (the theater stamps your ticket for 3 free hours) while leaving the umbrella &amp; overcoat at home. The other is to see a man who is always there. I do not know his name, but he defines the phrase "work ethic" like no other.</div><div><br /></div><div>His job is simple, but not easy. His task is boring, but rewarding. He needs to do little, but it requires considerable effort. He is not the boss, but you won't see the movie without his permission. He is the ticket taker. He is also severely disabled. I do not exaggerate when I tell you that all you can see of him is his face, feet, hands, and the rest of his twisted body in between, sitting in a wheelchair. He has difficulty raising his head and it requires considerable effort for him to tear the ticket stubs in half. But, he always greets you in a deep graveled voice, directs you to the correct theater, and tells you to enjoy the movie. Afterwards, on your way out, he thanks you for coming and asks for you to come back soon. You leave being appreciated, a mistake so many failing businesses have yet to learn. </div><div><br /></div><div>If more Americans gave 100% effort like him, we would not be questioning the future. We would be looking forward to it and enjoying our abundant lives. And, sometimes, taking in a flick.</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2010/01/circle-city-ambassador.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2010-01-10T11:44:06.246-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:92:"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__PybXc8C9yo/S0oDylXLF-I/AAAAAAAAAHA/uuIux1yf4PI/s72-c/j0403704.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-2301668296325558428";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 19 Dec 2009 19:15:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Bobby Knight";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Knight is Talking, Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1686:"Bobby Knight is coming ever so slowly out his shell and back to the State of Indiana. He was in town this week for an ESPN broadcast of a Butler game (the current favorite team in Indiana-uh, sorry Purdue). While here, he accepted an opportunity to speak at the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, not to be confused with the IU Hall of Fame that he recently snubbed after being inducted. Get over it Bobby.  Myles unfortunately, prematurely passed to the hereafter and everyone else who tried to modify your behavior is vamanos! As he was speaking, Bobby was the charming, somewhat foul-mouthed, PG-13, rule one violator (takes oneself to seriously) that he typically portrays.<div><br /></div><div>However, one sound bite by Bobby broadcasted by the local media was dead on true. The NCAA rule book has grown so verbose yet vague that compliance has become an issue of begging forgiveness rather than asking for permission. If one wanders "outside the lines", it merely takes a phone call to your attorney to negotiate your severance and next (bigger &amp; better) contract. </div><div><br /></div><div>Bobby took a direct swipe at John Calipari, the current Kentucky mentor, who has left his last two (three if you count the NJ Nets) in ashes. I witnessed Calipari's current stable of thoroughbreds last week against IU. It was boys playing men. Matter of fact, if I was Larry Bird, I would have traded the UK team straight up for the Pacers.

I have a beautiful wife and a wonderful family. I live in a comfortable home regardless of the weather, have charming neighbors &amp; great friends, and my dog loves me. I have savings, health insurance, more clothes than I need, enough electronic devices to start a pawn shop, and can travel anywhere on the three B's (bike, bus, and beemer).<div><br /></div><div>What do I need? Not much, actually. I was thinking of chucking my mobile, but the little lady wants to be able to track me via GPS should I hike the Appalachian Trail or have a sudden onset of Alzheimer's. I could use new exercise clothes. I have some now, but one of my charming neighbors thought my black baggy outfit made me look like M.C. Hammer. I could use a backpack to carry "whatever" while I tool around downtown on my bike. I guess I could use a plastic bag, but that carries an entirely different identity downtown. However, if I get none of these, it's no big deal.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, what do I want for Christmas? I want my soon-to-born grandson to be healthy. I want the wars wherever they are to end. I want everyone who wants a job to have one that fits their skills. And, most of all I want to stop wanting. I will need to learn to accept what I have is enough and trust the the Good Lord will give me what I need.</div><div><br /></div><div>That being said, here's hoping you get what you want or better-what you need this Christmas.<br /><div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://askindyted.blogspot.com/2009/12/what-i-want-for-christmas.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"noreply@blogger.com (Ted Meek)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2009-12-13T10:13:14.194-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1562057582089586392.post-432367382400224425";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 08 Dec 2009 00:43:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Christmas";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"Happy Holidays from Downtown Indy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4494:"<span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  ;font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px;"><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">It was the best of times.

Whoa! Wait a minute. That's the worst of times? It sure felt like it at first for me and the kids, but we cannot begin to tell you the love and support we received from so many friends and family. Every time we had a need, someone was there. Julie experienced all of the ups and downs...surgery, chemo, radiation, and the associated fatigue one would expect. However, she also felt blessed to have found "it" early, had great doctors (including Jo, Joel's fiance', and Brian), great caregivers at IU, and hundreds of prayers on her behalf. She is still a quart low in the energy department, but still does more than two people drinking Red Bulls. She is continuing to become more deeply involved at the IU School of Nursing. Somehow, I knew that was going to happen. But, she is in the right place at the right time for the two of us. IU and the health care world are fortunate to have her passion and expertise. </div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><br /></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Myself? I retired on Sept 30th (thank you my love). After 37 years in the graphic arts biz, I was "well" done. I am just getting into my new life, so allow me some time to decide what I plan to do. Right now, I rant on my blog, AskIndyTed, and do whatever Julie thinks I am qualified to do. So far, cooking is not one of them. I still fantasize about walking the Appalachian Trial.

He moved to Brooklyn last year and is exploring the possibility of owning rather than renting. If anyone has info on Kyle, please let us know. He likes to keep us all guessing. All we know is he's single, handsome, talented, charming, and a wonderful son. Look for his newest production on CBS College Sports (Dish Channel 152) on December 18th. The show is about Billy Cannon who won the Heisman in 1959 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

She is a breast oncologist at UCSF Medical Center. Google her and be amazed. Speaking of Google, Joel continues to play an important operations management role for Google Apps. This letter is a Doc which is one of the Apps. Confused?  Google it. You'll find the information. Moving on, they are getting "hitched" (Do they say that in CA?) on May 1st in the Santa Cruz Mountains. If you didn't have the opportunity to meet Jo's family at our home over Thanksgiving, they are a delight! Don't Google them. There is way too much info on their accomplishments.

Let me just say that B &amp; B are doing a great job. Brian continues his anesthesia residency with the possibility of focusing on pain management. Meanwhile, Brooke continues to be a great Mom and more. I haven't seen the likes of her since my own Julie.

border="0" alt="" /></a><br />No, that isn't a typo. I am talking about what I have had some difficulty with from time to time. You see, I've become a bit of a curmudgeon in my later years. I imagine it is a bit of an aversion to experiencing disappointment. Please understand, I just retired as a salesperson. In sales, rejection is a daily occurrence and you become a bit hardened as a means of self-preservation. Sometimes, after a long hard series of rejections, you are just not a lot of fun. <div><br /></div><div><div>But, I'm  getting off the subject, which is to find a way to become a "light" instead of a Captain Dark Cloud. This past weekend, I had my very own "It's a Wonderful Life" experience. You see, I have been in a royal funk over the past few years--frustrated with the way "things" have turned out. There's no reason to re-hash my past. Let's just say it was not what I had envisioned for myself. </div><div><br /></div><div>Then, last weekend, we threw a party!</div><div><br /></div><div>Over a hundred friends, family, and neighbors came to our home to celebrate the engagement of Joel (my second oldest) to a wonderful woman named Jo. It was quite an event in our small downtown condo. There was conversation, laughter, hugging, kissing, great food, stories, and me--feeling just like Jimmy Stewart at the end of the movie. It does not matter what has happened in your life. It only matters that people care. </div><div><br /></div><div>So, feeling a little down? Hug someone.

And, I must say, London seems to really have its act together. The city is absolutely beautiful, rich with history, fast-paced (I've never seen people walk that fast), polite, well-dressed, and VOID of litter. I'm not kidding! No trash anywhere except in the few hard to find trash receptacles. <div><br /></div><div>Why would I notice? Because, I live on a busy city street in Indy when folks seems to think it is quite appropriate to toss whatever they like on the ground. What is even more amazing is that most litter is comprised of a fairly limited variety. So, here's my list and a few suggestions.</div><div><br /></div><div>1) Cigarette butts. Please swallow them when done. I feel like I'm touching your lips every time I pick one up.</div><div>2) Snack bags. Do you realize that the half-life of a snack bag is longer than a human life? Stop eating this crap and you'll live longer in a cleaner environment.</div><div>3) Candy wrappers. Eat all of the candy you want. My brother is a dentist and he could use the business, but please stick the wrapper in you pocket and let your dog sniff it when you get home.</div><div>4) Hostess Twinkie, Ho-Ho, Cupcake, and any thing with a creme or fruit filling wrappers. Have you ever read what is in them? Your first clue should be the way they spell "creme". It's not really cream. It's an emulsion of chemicals they had leftover after making window caulk. Is that what you're doing? Caulking your pie hole?</div><div>5) Soft drink bottles. If you're thirsty, drink water. When the bottle is empty, fill it up and use it again.</div><div>6) Plastic shopping bags. Instead of taking out the aforementioned items and throwing them on the ground followed by the bag, keep the bag. Then, put your trash in it and carry it to the closest receptacle.</div><div><br /></div><div>Better yet, don't buy any of these diabetic/heart disease time bombs.

The office is only three blocks away, but it was a one-way strut into retirement from working and having my own set of wheels.<div><br /></div><div>However, I have a couple of sons who have shown me the light of living without owning a carbon dioxide-belching American icon. </div><div><br /></div><div>My oldest, Kyle, lives in New York City where having a car is more of an inconvienence and expense that he can live without. Besides, the Metro can get you anywhere in about thirty minutes if you don't mind walking a couple of blocks to the station only to descend into a grimy subterranean and somewhat odoriferous underground. But, it works and it's cheaper than  a taxi. </div><div><br /></div><div>My other son, Joel, lives in beautiful and just as pricey San Francisco. You can get around in the Bay Area in a car as long as you do not need to park it. Parking is a sport in San Fran. You must be able to track Google Maps on your iPhone, talk to the old man(that would be me), and drive 80mph without having a high-speed collision in the morning fog. He prefers the Google Shuttle and it's free(that's my boy!)! When he needs a car, he either rents one by the hour or mooches his sweetie's wheels.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, what am I to do in Indy? We have no subways or shuttles (unless you live in Hamilton County), but we do have IndyGo. It can take you anywhere as long as you are not in a hurry and you need to go to a suburban mall. IndyGo is an incomplete answer to Indy's urban sprawl and low population density, but I am getting off the subject. How do I get around town? </div><div><br /></div><div>On my bike! Indy is not New York or San Fran, but just about everything you need is within a 10 minute ride on a bicycle. The streets are wide and the sidewalks are plentiful albeit illegal as I found out on a Sunday while cruising around downtown before a Colts game. I almost received two tickets from the police because I wasn't willing to play chicken in the street with a bunch of drunks driving scores of re-cycled school buses painted blue with "Go Colts" painted on the side. </div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, it's good exercise and it makes the neighbors giggle when I peddle by.

Remember when the Hoosier/RCA Dome was built in the early '80's? Well, our fair Mayor Hudnut felt, and rightfully so, that Downtown Indianapolis needed a kick in the pants. So, he proactively proposed building the Dome with the enormous help of the Lilly and Krannert Foundations even though we had no promise of landing the Colts or numerous NCAA events. It cost the city less than $40 million (and a 1% restaurant tax). It was a GREAT deal. The downtown immediately began to change for the better. On the bad side, we also got the Irsay's. Mayor Hudnut also made the choice to use union labor on the condition that they promised to never strike as a tool to negotiate during its construction. </div><div><br /></div><div>However, just like the greedy bankers in NYC, the locals saw an opportunity to squeeze a lot of cash out of the local citizens of Indianapolis. Soon after the dome, we landed the Pan Am Games in 1984. Subsequently, we built the Natatorium, the Velodrome, the Track &amp; Field Stadium, and upgraded numerous facilities using Hunt Construction and Wilhelm Construction, the same folks who built the Dome. </div><div><br /></div><div>In the meantime, the bonds for the Dome were being paid down rapidly by the 1% food tax, so Hudnut decided to roll them over and add onto the Convention Center. Thus, since it was connected to the Dome, the tax would not expire and Hunt, Wilhelm, and the unions had a meal ticket extension. Not to drag this out, but we soon had new buildings all over the IUPUI Campus, Conseco Arena, Lucas Oil Stadium, a new billion dollar airport terminal, and a new $300 million addition to the convention center being built on the land where the RCA Dome once stood with a $48 million debt that was built in 1980 for less than $40 million. Hmm, something stinks.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, we have forked over about $25 million to help a billionaire build a new hotel across the street from the convention center. So, what do all of these projects have in common? Nearly all were all built by Hunt or Wilhelm with union labor at increasingly ridiculous costs. Moreover, none of these government funded buildings pay a dime in taxes. Meanwhile, the hotel, rental car, local income, property, and food taxes have all increased dramatically as people like the Irsay's have increased their wealth. The Colts are now valued around $1 billion. Next time they threaten to leave, I'll help load the Mayflower van.</div><div><br /></div><div>Which brings me to Wi$hard Ho$pital's proposal to build a new $700 million facility. The current building is tired and out-of-date. But, the city would be the guarantor of $600 million of new bonds. Looks like Hunt, Wilhelm, and the trade unions are going to have plenty of work. The taxpayers? They are getting lots of new debt and taxes, but we get to vote on this one. </div><div><br /></div><div>I hope to see you at the polls on November 3rd.

College football (IU-ugh!), sleeping in (with my sweetie), eating breakfast out at your favorite restaurant (City Cafe'), working in the yard (Not me!

So, what is Saturday when you "drop out:? Well, yesterday was the day after Friday, today is Saturday,and tomorrow will be the day before Sunday .I still feel as if two days from now it will be Monday and you all know that Monday is not a favorite of the masses.

I just became aware one day that I existed.  There were rules, and I was breaking them. School was challenging yet things came to me with relative ease. I never had much money only to realize I had everything I needed. I guess my largest obstacle was finding my soul mate and lo and behold she arrived two months after I started to work. It may sound like I am simplifying things, but this is a blog-not a book. </div><div><br /></div><div>At the age of twenty-one I started to really work for a living. I always had jobs, but that was just for mad money. This time it was for real. I needed to pay my own way. There wasn't a lifeline back to Mom and Dad when I was short a few bucks. It was stressful to learn a career, pay the bills, and be madly in love all at the same time. Then, before I can say "Jack Sprat", I'm married with three kids. Guys are built to take on things one at a time. That's at least four things! Once again, I'm simplifying, but that's another book.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fast forward to today. I'm retiring this afternoon. I have handed off all of my work to others, it's 3PM, and I have two more hours to go. Come 5 o'clock, I will turn in my car keys and credit cards, but I'll hold onto my cell until it stops ringing. What now? What in the Sam Hill am I going to do with the last chunk of my life? I have some ideas like mentoring some of the kids who find it unnecessary to finish school, aka...life chunk numero uno. I will need to change my perspective from "Leave it to Beaver" to "South Park". It's a big shift from the Beav and Wally breaking a window to Kenny getting killed every week. </div><div><br /></div><div>Should be interesting.

The last decade in the printing supply industry overall has been more like the "agony of defeat". <div><br /></div><div>Just like all industries that come and go over time, the process of putting the printed word on a piece of paper is becoming dangerous to your wealth. I do not need to tell you what technological wonders have occurred in the past twenty years.  But all those innovations have <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">diminished</span> a wonderful business that was started by my father around the time of my earthly arrival, right smack dab in the middle of the twentieth century on July 1, 1950. That business, Modern Photo Offset Supply, has provided a wonderful lifestyle for our entire family over the last six decades. And, the company will continue to operate under my two older brothers as long as someone continues to read newspapers, clip coupons, mail Christmas cards, or ask for a brochure at Government Motors rather than checking out the website.  So it's with lots of memories, lots of gratitude and lots of anticipation for what lies ahead, that my last day will be September 30th.</div><div><br /></div><div>So what's next?

So, maybe I can help some kid who doesn't have a father figure in his or her life. The new buzz word is "mentor", but that sounds like I would have all of the answers. I don't. </div><div><br /></div><div>Nevertheless, I think I can help. Currently, only 22% of the males in IPS graduate in four years.
