How much have I missed? Well, we saw the Hawks drop some games, then win some important games, and then drop a downer last night in Detroit. They lost to a Red Wings team that didn't have half their team including one greatest player in the league and their star goaltender. There were many holes, but most of it comes down to work and effort from the Hawks, because puck support was nowhere to be seen.

So, why do the Hawks drop some games they shouldn't, thenvplay a great game against the Avs only to drop a point, and win against the Bruins and Ducks, only to drop a big game in Detroit? I get a lot of arguments when I point the finger at Q, but here we go.

Let me start by saying that I could care less about losing games in January, especially if they win in the playoffs. I do have perspective, and am optimistic. But, I'm a blogger and this what we do.

The ways in which the Hawks often find themselves in trouble are constant complaints of this blog, and for questioning the coaching going on. This brings me to what I think the best attribute of Q's coaching is. The atmosphere of calm. One of the greatest aspects of this team is their composure and ease towards dealing with pressure. I just don't think they feel it anymore, and Q has a lot to do with it. You have that to thank for the best 17 seconds in Hawks history. Q brings composure and trust in certain players.

This has a lot to do with why the Hawks drop insignificant games in January, only to raise their game against the Avs, Bruins and Ducks. So, what about yesterday? This was a big game, against a big foe, and a limited occurrence these days. Jump out to an early 2 goal lead against a struggling, injured team you want to beat, and then blow it. Not good.

Here's where you get into the real issues of this team, and why I find the best reason for Q's winning record to be the great rosters he has had the luck of coaching. When the effort is not there, and the roster isn't covering up the faults of this team, they are very vulnerable. I'm talking about a 4th line that hasn't done very well in puck possession at all, the low minutes or benching of players who thrive at puck possession. I'm talking about the plain horrible defensive positioning this team displays when their opponent can lead in puck possession, and the terrible lack of support from any line besides the Toews' line.

Not only was Q outcoached last night, as he often is against Babcock, but a minor league team out smarted and out hustled his allstar roster. Shaw and Saad were hustling, but they weren't moving the puck correctly, or going to the right areas of the ice to support the transition into the Wings zone. Why is this? Where is the coaching? Kane was swarmed every time he had the puck, because Babcock saw his linemates not opening up the ice correctly. The only way to handle Kane is to swarm him and take away all of his space that other teams give up easily. You might question Pirri's efforts, but he was always in the right place at the right time which didn't allow teams to do this.

I hate to gripe about Saad, because he is a monster of a player, as is Shaw, but intensity is nothing without head's up movements and going to the right areas of the ice at the right times.

One might expect the defensive positioning to be the strongest element of a team coached by a defensemen, but this is the Hawks worst characteristic, and the Wings also exploited that last night. They got pucks deep, and kept them there, having all day to set up their point, or wait for the Hawks to get out of position. Sure, this was exacerbated by Oduya's rough play lately, and especially last night, but it isn't only him, and his wingers could do him a favor by staying in the zone a little longer. There was one play where I saw Hossa flee the zone when Oduya had the puck, and the Wings noticed the Hawks were a man short in the zone and pounced. They ended up with a prime scoring chance as Hossa made his way back into the zone for the faceoff.

I saw support against the Ducks, but it was completely absent from last night's game. This is far too common of a theme, and if they play any team in the playoffs that can find a way to keep pucks deep, they will be in trouble. I mean, maybe we can knock this off to always being on the offense, but that's just making excuses.

Hjalmer was interviewed between periods against the Ducks and he mentioned support and positioning as the greatest reasons they win or lose. When you tear down the star talents of the NHL, all that is left is playing hard, playing positioned with a purpose, and supporting your teammates. We saw what happens when one team does it, and the other doesn't last night, regardless of talent level.

When they want to win, it seems like the Hawks can pull it out no matter what. They have that much skill. They couldn't do that against the Wings, and this was even with a really shaky goaltender in net. I would really like to see the Hawks clean up some of these big holes in their game, because what just happened might start happening a little more often going forward.

P.S. I thought Kruger played great and has all year. This is only greater concern for what Bollig does when he doesn't have the puck, because that line is struggling.

And, why can't Kaner just do his slow down quadruple quick stick handling move every shootout attempt? It is the only thing that works for him, and probably would have taken that extra point.

Also, Darren Helm is my favorite player that doesn't wear a Hawks uniform. Has been for a while, and I don't say that enough because he plays for the Wings. He's Stalberg with more hockey smarts and purpose, and he owned the Hawks all night long.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Hostile Hawk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5924:"Peeking my head out of the mountainous pile of educational work that is my life these days, I bring to you a post with ponderings of the Blackhawks and coach Q as of late.

Especially when you don't have cable TV. Thankfully, I own a cafe and one of the few rewards of that is having access to said internet and the world.

I mentioned in the last post that the Hawks weren't looking so great, and then they went and lost another game, and in regulation this time. Nope, it hasn't been the best hockey we have seen this year, and I think you can officially say the Hawks have been slumping since the holiday break.

I suppose you could use the break and looming Olympics as justification for a good time to drop the intensity a little, as Iplaguitar mentioned recently in a comment.

One of the few saving graces has been the play of Brandon Saad who has been moved around a bit in what seems to be an attempt to give 2 different lines the benefits of his presence. It is certain that the US team will miss his contributions if he really doesn't play in the Olympics. He can do just about anything, and he does it well, as seen by his movement around the lines while only being a rookie.

Another thing to be happy about was Kruger's presence on the 2nd line against the Rangers. For some reason, Q needed to see Handzus on that line for just a few more shifts before again realizing that he is furthest from the solution to the 2nd line center concerns. Not that he was any worse than usual, but the Hawks continued to have their really bad starts to the game which has been one of the elements of their late December, early January woes. In comes Kruger, and he might have given his best performance of the season in the role. No, his lacking offensive skills weren't exactly pretty, but he was there to make a play, kept up with and got the puck to the right people. While I don't see him as the longtime solution, he proved to be a better option than Zus for now.

Another element that poked its head out as a positive over the past weeks was a couple of strong moments from the goaltending. Raanta's shutout being the highlight, which was exactly what the Hawks needed to pick up a win during this drought. However, while Crawford has had some really strong periods, his performance hasn't been enough to grab a few more points while his team suffers. I hate to say it, but this is just an example of Crawford's abilities. He isn't the goalie that is going to steal a lot of games, and he is only as good as his team.

Bickell's play has been another source of frustration, but that changed against the Rangers. The 3rd line, thanks in part to Saad's return, was the best line for the Hawks. Anyone else missing Stalberg right now, or Frolik for that matter? All to sign Khabi.

Besides bad starts to the game, 2 of the biggest issues for the Hawks lately has been their sloppy mistakes when making or not making passes, and their lack of defensive responsibility. The Rangers for one, took advantage of the tendency for Seabs and Keith to pinch on more than a few occasions, and the usually superb back-check of the Hawks was nowhere in sight.

This whole slump could come down to focus and intensity really.

Back to that 2nd line center thing. In the past, I would have become a little ill at the idea of Kruger in the that role. By most measures, he is not one. However, he has gone from 71st in face-offs within the NHL to 10th, and this used to be one of his biggest concerns. And, while he isn't going to finish many plays for the Hawks, he might not need to when playing with Kane and Saad/Versteeg. He really just needs to provide the defensive positioning he does, get them the puck, and then keep up.

But, one of the problems is now what to do with Zus. He found himself on the 4th line, and while Smith has been playing some smart and hard hockey, Zus really makes that line slow. Smith is not the quickest player, and nor is Bollig. This could be a problem, and maybe even provides a larger reason to bring Morin back, who happens to be the Hawks leading puck-possession player according to the stats this year.

And that's just it. Here we are, scraping at a 2nd line center and looking at a rough 4th line because Q seems to refuse the plethora of young talent in the system in order to play his veteran. If we had spent this half of the season developing the talent, we might be in a better place right now. The result is a team in a slump (no biggy, but still), a 4th line that will not eat up many minutes, which leads to more minutes for the top 2, and they are all in the olympics.

All of this talk could be pointless come next year, as Teuvo Teravainen comes into the mix. He destroyed in the Junior Olympics.

Maybe tonight will present a better picture, and in the end a slump isn't that bad. We don't need the Hawks to finish in first place. We need them to be healthy and reading for another Cup run.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Hostile Hawk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4855:"Not having internet at home is harder on my life than it should be.

But, one of the problems is now what to do with Zus. He found himself on the 4th line, and while Smith has been playing some smart and hard hockey, Zus really makes that line slow. Smith is not the quickest player, and nor is Bollig. This could be a problem, and maybe even provides a larger reason to bring Morin back, who happens to be the Hawks leading puck-possession player according to the stats this year.

And that's just it. Here we are, scraping at a 2nd line center and looking at a rough 4th line because Q seems to refuse the plethora of young talent in the system in order to play his veteran. If we had spent this half of the season developing the talent, we might be in a better place right now. The result is a team in a slump (no biggy, but still), a 4th line that will not eat up many minutes, which leads to more minutes for the top 2, and they are all in the olympics.

All of this talk could be pointless come next year, as Teuvo Teravainen comes into the mix. He destroyed in the Junior Olympics.

Maybe tonight will present a better picture, and in the end a slump isn't that bad. We don't need the Hawks to finish in first place. We need them to be healthy and reading for another Cup run.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

That game displayed some sloppy hockey from the Hawks. Thanks to Raanta's rebound, and his shutout against the Kings, the Hawks won a 1-0 game that didn't exactly present the best Hawks hockey, but it was solid. They came back after falling behind 2 to the Islanders, but lost it in OT. The Hawks allowed the Isles to beat them at their own game for the bulk of that performance. New Jersey was giving the Hawks a run for their money, and only after the allstar Patrick Sharp decided to net another hat-trick was that game decided. Cut to last night where the Hawks dropped the shutout (for the 4th time in a row now) in a game that saw the Sharks direct 42 shots on net. No sir, the Hawks have not looked good for over a week now.

A few of these recent games have been a snooze fest in which the Hawks couldn't get much going. Last night was no different. I blame positioning and passing in large part, although it also looks like the Hawks are a little flat footed. It has caused some shifting in the line-combos by Q, most notably, the consistent demotion of Versteeg, which caused Kane to see 5 different line-mates in a couple games, and Bickell to only register 5 minutes of icetime last night. That last stat becomes a little more concerning when you see that Smith and Bollig only had 8 minutes each. Yep, that leaves Kane to accrue over 22 minutes in a game that ended with a loss and no Kane on the scoring sheet. Remember, the #1 goal should be to keep this team healthy.

If I can recall correctly, Smith had 2 shifts in the 3rd, Bollig had 1, and Bickell sat the whole period out.

The Hawks have only won 4 games that have gone to OT, which is out of a possible 13. What gives with that stat?

What aches me a little bit about the Bickell icetime is that Q pretty much admitted it was in reaction to a goal being scored while Bicks was standing still. Yes, not a good effort by Bicks there, but I have seen Handzus do the same thing numerous times.

There was only 1 penalty in last night's game, and it was to Bollig after trying to get Brown to fight after he made a dangerous hit on Oduya that went without a call. You could argue that the game-tieing goal by Burns shouldn't have counted after the cross-check he laid on Hjalmer to be open for the pass (although that still was a hell of a pass from Thornton). Shaw was blatantly pulled down trying to exit the zone once. Yeah, you could make a case that no-calls hurt the Hawks last night, and that they need a power-play goal to decide games, but that doesn't excuse the weak play for most of the game. Because, otherwise, it was a fairly clean game

(However, I would like to note that Bollig can't even get players to fight him, and that the dangerous hit happened right in front of him. So, does having an "enforcer" really help? And, would Morin be a better option to play?)

So where have the Hawks been going wrong lately? Well, besides a lack of clean passing since the short break, I feel like other teams have been up to the challenge of trying to slow the Hawks entry into the o-zone and then working their butts off to win battles in the corners. This, along with really careful and smart defensive positioning has put out a lot of Blackhawk fires. Part of it is surely the chance to beat the best team in the NHL and how everyone else brings their A-game against them.

The other issue, is that the Hawks haven't exactly matched it. Their allstars have gotten them out of it a few times, or been the difference here and there, but if you just take Sharp's scoring out of the equation, then the Hawks are looking at a really bad run here. IMO, the Hawks defensive positioning has been the achilles heal. I almost pull my hair out watching all of the blown coverage (But, Bickell is the only one who gets sat). Keith's speed and skating ability, along with the efforts of Hjalmer &amp; Oduya's great work, and Seabrook's ability to get the puck out with a good pass have gone above and beyond to mask what otherwise has been really shotty coverage by the Hawks. This has been a big difference. Just look at all of the quality chances their opponents have had against them in recent games.

This is a testament to the performances of the goaltenders, minus Raanta's brainfart against the Blues. And, if you haven't already heard my opinion on the subject, I think Raanta should stay with the Hawks and allow a Crow-Emery situation to blossom again. The competition is good for both of them, and the time off between games will do wonders for Crow. And of course, Raanta earned it.

I want to go back to the Islanders game for a moment.

This game saw a good start by the Hawks, but this start (which we have become used to) hasn't been the case lately. I feel like the Hawks aren't coming out of the gate with as much energy as we are used to. Of course, Bickell was at the hand of a turnover that helped the Hawks to be trailing after that period.

The problem for me was how much the Hawks lost control after that period. The Isles stepped it up, realizing they could win the game, and the Hawks lost all concentration. Again, they are just giving other teams way too much space from bad coverage, positioning, and a lack of battle in the corners. Their opponents, and the Isles did it here, are taking that space away from the Hawks. A ridiculous amount of chemistry from the core that has played together for so long now, and their superior talent has showed up from time-to-time which has kept these games close.

But, even the Toews line has been guilty of blown coverage, which was beyond obvious in the Isles game and is why I wanted to comment on it. What gives? And speaking of Toews, their were rumors that he was injured, and then he scored a few goals silencing it, but have you seen him beat anyone lately? Sure, he still has the upper hand in the corners, but he is even losing some of those battles lately. I remember a Toews that could blow past a defender to create room, and it hasn't been the case lately.

Adding to that thought, Hossa has been subpar for a while now. It might be time for his annual injury to give him the time off he needs. I say it a lot, and will continue to do so, Hossa can't play top line minutes every game of the season. My guess is that Toews has a minor injury that refuses to heal.

The other issue with this game was that Kane's line was choked pretty well all night. This is what brought us to seeing Saad moved into Versteeg's position and then Shaw to replace Zus. Saad shows us that when given the opportunity, he will most likely take it, and he added a little needed jump into that line. But, I feel like Versteeg understood Kane better and placed himself in the flow more efficiently. Switching Shaw for Zus definitely added speed to the movement last night, but again, I don't think anyone understood each other which left Kane looking a little frustrated and without a point. I say stay the course on this one for a bit, and give it some practicing time.

Oh my did Q smirk when being asked if he had wanted to switch Versteeg and Saad for a while now. It would seem there is again, a difference of opinion between he and SB about how Versteeg should be used and Q was just waiting to kick Kris down a tad. Lucky for Kris, Bicks is Q's current whipping boy. Bollig can do no wrong.

Sorry, a lot said here, but I missed a few games.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Last Minute Add:</span></strong>

I just read over at the Committed Indian that Kane has scored 0 times at even strength when Handzus was out with him! ZERO times! Holly tarnations Batman, that can't be true, but apparently it is. It was also mentioned that Shaw's presence at center has had the best results on Kane's scoring, although Pirri has been the center for the most of Kane's even strength goals. The numbers back-up the observations. Enough already.

Also, I forgot to mention that I felt last night was an example of getting out-coached a bit. San Jose was killing it at match-ups, as McLellan had his way with Q. Plus, San Jose seemed to win every important face-off which was followed by a well run play by the Sharks. In fairness, Hjalmer's goal seemed like a run play as well.

Most importantly to us and most shocking is that our very own Saader did not make the Olympic team, despite being a heavy favorite from the panel making the choices. Not so shocking was that Leddy also missed out on a spot, although the team is weak on the defensive roster, including a hole in puck moving ability, you really couldn't see him making it. The biggest shocker on the D, is that Jack Johnson didn't make the team, which is going to hurt the team IMO. Brooks Orpik took his spot which was not a wise choice.

It should also be mentioned that Sharp easily made the Canadian team, and that they have Keith and Doughty slated to play alongside each other. That is going to be a quick moving D. Seabrook also made the team, but is currently slated on the 4th pairing.

Back to Saader. I find it hard to swallow that Seabrook made the Canadian team while Saad missed out on the American roster. Another absent player from the roster sure to garnish some criticism is Bobby Ryan. I however agree with this choice, Ryan doesn’t bring the intensity they are looking for. Apparently, there were 4 players buying for 2 spots on the team. Bobby Ryan, Saad, T.J. Oshie, and Blake Wheeler of the Jets. I am a fan of Oshie, but can’t believe he and Wheeler made it over Saad. It would seem that the coaches favored those 2. I think the coaches don’t understand what they are losing in Saad's 2-way, hard-nosed, and extremely smart play. Saad has shown he can play anywhere and do everything. The intensity he brings, and how hard he is to play against will be missed. Plus, he has nothing to lose being that he is still a rookie. Reading through the decision process, Saad was a favorite through the talks and just lost it to a personal opinion by the coaching staff. If it had been up to the selection panel alone, Saad makes the team, as he was the favored player through most of the talks up until the last day. Weird, but I have a feeling Saad makes that trip in the end.

Maybe the Olympic team's loss is the Hawks gain, because it keeps 1 of our great players from getting injured.

So, the Hawks have 4 players on team Canada, Hjalmer and Oduya will make team Sweden, Hossa and even Handzus will make team Slovakia, and Kaner is on team America. 9 players, which include almost all of the top 2 lines right now, minus Versteeg.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Hostile Hawk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2775:"For a good read on the selection process and the list of players who filled out the roster in the end, check this link out: <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/hockey/story/_/id/10195703/how-us-hockey-team-bound-sochi-olympics-was-named" target="_blank">USA Hockey Story.</a><a title="USA Hockey Story." href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/hockey/story/_/id/10195703/how-us-hockey-team-bound-sochi-olympics-was-named">

So, the Hawks have 4 players on team Canada, Hjalmer and Oduya will make team Sweden, Hossa and even Handzus will make team Slovakia, and Kaner is on team America. 9 players, which include almost all of the top 2 lines right now, minus Versteeg.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

The team, and Raanta bounced back from a weak performance in a big way, which shows them taking 5 out of the possible 6 points in this 3 games in 4 days stretch following the holidays. Not bad at all, especially when considering the opponents they faced. (Should have 6 of 6 points)

Games like this aren't very fun to watch, but again, the Hawks proved they can win the Kings way, and they have more than proved they can win their own way throughout the season. Besides a few bad positioning moments, the Hawks weren't far away from being perfect. I would argue that this game was a little too close for comfort and that the Hawks find a balance between still forcing the offense without cheating on their D, but you have to be happy about the outcome. The way the Kings play puts a damper on utilizing a backcheck which is the fuel for the Hawks offense. So there you go.

Someone I like to pick on this year, and last year, and the year before is Brent Seabrook. Besides his shotty play through the year, I have a problem with how much he is promoted in the media for his "great" play, because of his stats. Just remember that Hjalmer and Oduya have been getting the toughest assignments and hardest shifts. This has allowed for Seabrook and Keith to exploit their offensive talents, while masking Brent's defensive laziness. This game was a little different however. I thought Seabrook had an inspired effort and used his body to be a difference maker, which is something he doesn't do enough. Honestly, in the past 10 games or so, Seabs has been strong in at least 7 of them.

Now, I read a comment by someone somewhere that touched upon what I just mentioned. Could it be that Q has purposefully put Keith and Seabrook against other team's weaker offenses in not only an attempt to shield them from defensive follies, but also to allow their offensive talents to shine? It has also been common for 7 and 2 to play against other team's 4th lines with our very own 4th line. I like this thought, but just wish Eddie O would do a better job of mentioning the work load of Hjalmer and Oduya. All of the work, none of the glory.

Sure, Seabrook was the one who caused the penalty shot for Brown, being that he was the last D-man back and the one who put his stick on Brown's hands. But, as it was mentioned elsewhere around the interwebs, Handzus was actually the one who was out of position on that rush that allowed Brown to slip past the whole team untouched. Sorry, I have to point out when Zus makes costly mistakes.

Another inspired effort from Saad. I would go so far as to say an inspired effort from that entire line. Not shocking seeing that these are the types of games where their skills can be better utilized. I thought Shaw made some great plays throughout. It is just expected of Saad at this point.

Unfortunately, Kane's scoring streak came to an end. Hey, the Hawks won without Kane or Sharp scoring!

Better job by the PK. I'm still not okay with Bollig playing here, and find it hard to understand how his mistakes are completely ignored, though he is playing hard and making the best of his abilities. Bollig had more ice than Bickell did, and I am still waiting for Versteeg to take that PK spot from Bollig. Worth mentioning as well, is that the hit Bollig laid out on Doughty should have resulted in a Kings power-play, which was not a good time for one. Yes, when a team plays like the Kings, they ask for it a little, but that hit was dangerous for Bollig to make.

Another game where Ben Smith was taking some of the more important face-offs, and he almost never cleanly lost one. He fights so hard that his losses end up a battle for the loose puck.

And back to Raanta. He made some big saves and finally broke his 2 goals against theme, coming off of his worst showing no less. With little time in the NHL, he has really made a good impression and has shown to be a quick learner. Sure, those angles are still killing him, but like we have said here before, the good seem to outweigh his needed improvements, which will most likely come.

So, the question becomes, what should Q do with him when Crow comes back during the next trip? They could send him back down to Rockford and let him work on his needed improvements with a little less pressure, freedom, and more ice-time. LaBarbera would then be the back-up.

I say keep Raanta up here, and let Crow ease back in. The main goal is to keep this team healthy, and days off help that along. I have little doubt that Crawford was so strong in the playoffs because of the many games off throughout that season. Switching between Raanta and Crow would end up being a plus for both goaltenders IMO. Raanta will have less pressure, Crow will get his rest, and Raanta will continue to work on his play against NHL caliber players. It should not be overlooked, the effort Raanta has shown after getting thrown into this situation, and it should also be rewarded.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Hostile Hawk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5375:"Thanks to a wonderful and determined goal by Saader, the Hawks proved that they can win tight defensive games, and that Antti Raanta can provide the shutout necessary to do so.

Since I didn't post after the big win, I find myself in an interesting position of critique. There was a lot to praise, and a lot to complain about from a Hawks fan perspective. What I am left thinking the most is that the Hawks have had the same little holes in their otherwise superhero-like exterior through the course of this season, and even before it. These issues might end up being a problem by the time playoffs roll around, and they might not be. The strength of this team most definitely has it in them to overcome their shortcomings, and Patrick Sharp scoring 4 goals in 2 nights while Kaner continues his point streak are 2 of those strengths.

Okay, so the Hawks blow the Avs out of the water thanks to Sharp's hat-trick. We have spent quite a bit of time promoting the awesomeness that is Sharp this season, in every aspect of his game, so I don't need to say much more here, but if this guy is not on the Olympic roster then there are some serious issues in the selection process.

And while we are on the subject of players buying for a spot on the Canadian roster, how's about that Seabrook? It kills me that Seabs has been racking up points and killing it in the plus/minus department, because others have such an argument against my contempt for his play this year, which has been better than last year, and has also been better in the past 5-7 games, but not last night. Yes, he has great vision with the puck, can make a great breakout pass, and pinch at the right times, but he costs the Hawks far too many goals and scoring chances against for just plain brainfarts and lack of effort.

Raanta was not good last night, and he allowed his customary 2 goals against to an Avs team that should have been shutout, but he doesn't even have to screw that equalizing goal up if Seabrook can clear the puck on his 2 tries, and not let a slow skater blow past him. Raanta, same issues as before. Get out of your net and learn the angles better. You aren't big enough to not do it. I suggest a few nights of watching Jonathan Quick videos and how aggressive he is on shooters and the puck. I was burned last night after talking Raanta up to friends, not that I don't acknowledge the work he needs. At the end of the day though, goaltending has not been a friend to the Hawks.

Friday night's and the heavy list of injuries to the Blues set up a pretty good scenario for the Hawks. A 1st and 3rd period 2-goal lead presented a must win situation, and being the powerful team the Hawks are, it should have been easy to squeeze the Blues out. But, they didn't, the players got lazy, and so did the coaching staff. Bad match-ups in the end, and bad management of the lines and players helped blow this game.

Giving Smith more ice-time, I'm all for it. The kid does everything right, and what do you know, he also seems to kill it at the dot in important situations. Somebody who wasn't winning important face-offs was Shaw. So, I find it curious that Shaw was sat in the 3rd to play a Kruger/Smith/Saad line in the 2nd game in as many nights only to put Shaw out there for an important face-off in the defensive zone.

So, Shaw, Bickell, and Bollig all get sat in the 3rd period, again, in a back-to-back game situation when Q's main goal should be keeping his stars healthy all year. Okay, does that mean Q agrees that we would be better off having Morin up, a player that kills it in puck possession stats and in generating offensive chances, instead of sitting Bollig for an entire period? The Blues are the one team we should have a player like Bollig for, and Q can't even play him with a 2-goal lead in the 3rd.

It was a rough night for all, but small choices, and little plays were the difference last night. The Hawks have the skill to overcome these oversights, but wouldn't it be better not to see them at all? Still, 3 points in 2 games should be considered a victory even if they gave 2 points away to their biggest threat in the league.

Leaving you on a high note: That play in the Avs game, when Sharp came from behind Matt Duchene (one of the fastest skaters in the league) on the breakaway, lifted his stick, cleanly took the puck and turned it around for a stretch pass to put put Toews in on a great rush for an easy goal was one of the sickest plays of any Hawks this year.

Reasons for not getting time to talk about the Hawks include the pre-winterbreak rush at school and the many outside educational projects I have going on. One such project includes creating the biggest Illinois high school art show ever. Vegas is busy working on his higher education, and so it leaves us with little hockey time. I'm not even playing hockey right now.

So, it would seem posts are going to be fewer and further between these days. Might not be the game-to-game recaps of the past, but I will get here as often as I can to talk about my Blackhawks observations.

Shall We:

In case you didn't already know, the Hawks have one of the best back-checks in the league if not the best. It probably isn't mentioned enough that this is might be the greatest aspect of their game. Obviously stemming from their speed, the Hawks are relentless on opponents breakouts through neutral ice, and this is often the vehicle for a lot the offense they provide. BTW, I do give Q some credit for this approach to their game, but again, the roster is the source.

This helped squeeze the life out of the early goings of the game, because NJ is a pretty sound defensive team. Unfortunately for the Devils, the Hawks forecheck and offensive pressure proved too much to handle, and things started to open up after Sharp's first goal on the night.

With the help from the back-check causing NJ turnovers in the neutral zone, the Hawks held the Devils to 1 shot through 18 minutes of play and only 2 through the 1st period. As the Hawks offense started getting through the Devils barrier and the forecheck sustained that offensive pressure, we started to see just about as clean and clear of a win you could hope for heading into break.

As crazy as it sounds, this was not good enough to keep the Hawks on top of the league and conference as Anaheim went 9-0-1 in their last ten games and now have 1 point on the Hawks. A little segue here; I read an article on NHL.com before the Toronto loss that talked about the ridiculous record the Hawks have had in their previous 82 games. If it were a full season, it would have been one of the most dominant performances in the history of the NHL, behind of course, the Red Wings. Not to be outdone, the Ducks have had an almost as impressive record through the same space of time. Just saying, the Hawks would have finished with 128 points in an 82 game season, only 3 points behind the amazing 131 point season of the Wings. Both the Ducks and Hawks could very well top that this season.

Back to recent observations. Okay, let's get right to Sharp and Kane who are playing some unbelievable hockey these days. Sharp netted his 18th of the season and 10th in 14 games. Kaner netted his 22nd of the season and 49th point. What's that I hear, a 100 point season coming? Enough has been said about the seasons these 2 are having, but what is most impressive to me is their play when they don't have the puck, and the fact that Kane's goal was the result of over powering another payer to pick-up a garbage goal.

And I have to point it out that Handzus was not on the ice for Kane's goal which was the result of an amazing forecheck by Verstud. It is crazy when you look at Zus' numbers, because they are pretty harsh, while Kane's and Versteeg's are great. Not only do the numbers show some weak performances by Zus, he also missed a wide open rebound opportunity in the 1st period after a Kane rush, he allowed a great NJ scoring opportunity before that by failing to keep the puck deep and falling down, and he was in the slot when a loose puck was picked up by NJ for a goal against.

I know it is covered by all the goals and offensive generation by Kane, but Zus is not playing well. I had to laugh when Eddie mentioned what Zus said about why Q is such a good coach. "Because when you're playing well, you play, and when you're not, he tells you."

Back to Versteeg for a moment. Yes, that play to steal possession deep in the NJ zone and feed Leddy which resulted in Kaner's goal was a sick play, and Versteeg deserves a lot of credit. But, plays like that from him are becoming more and more frequent as Kris begins to find his place and role on this team, and playing with Kane. Good things.

The Hawks actually scored 2 goals off of amazing forechecks like the Versteeg one. Not surprising, the other because of Saad.

I have harped a lot on Seabrook this year, and I still think he deserves it, but he has been looking better in the past 5 or so games. Unfortunately, that 2nd goal against, involving that loose puck, falls heavily on him. Then on Zus IMO.

Hey, Bickell was given too much time to let his wrister go, and that's what happens. I like how that line balances out, even though I'm not sure Saad belongs on the 3rd line.

Overall, a very solid win, sprinkled with a lot of goalposts hit by the Hawks.

Other thoughts:

Okay, that 4th line has been playing against other team's top lines and it is really worrying me. Sure, the Hawks are winning, so it isn't a big problem, but their numbers against these lines suggest that they should be getting lit up. Which means, we are lucky they haven't been lit up. Last night, they didn't play against NJ's top lines, and they were still outplayed. In fact, they were the only line outplayed. I don't think that Smith is the problem, because frankly, the kid is a beast and does almost everything right.

There have been talks about Keith getting the Norris this year. I have to ask how he could when another D-man on his team is playing the toughest minutes? Hjalmer and Oduya have been getting the roughest assignments and have been playing brilliant shut-down hockey. This cannot be overstated.

I have been worried from recent performances that Leddy just isn't up to physical challenges.

The Hawks don't seem to win when their power-play doesn't score. Going 0-4 in the Nucks game is the reason they lost. Props to Vancouver for playing an excellent shut-down game though. The Hawks had very little space.

Raanta's atheticism outweighs his problems IMO. His issues have a lot to do with playing the angles right, and that has a lot to do with not being used to American hockey. He also has concerns with having players all up in his crease and face. However, he seems to be getting better at seeing pucks through that traffic and dealing with it. A handful of goals were the result of his angles though, and if he was putting himself in the right positions, the pucks would start hitting him instead of squeaking through sides. It starts with coming out of the net a little more.

My question is then, how does he stack-up against Crow? There has been enough of a sample on Raanta to start talking about it. Raanta's numbers are better, and he has more potential to get better. Do we, and should we have a goalie controversy on our hands once again? After the Christmas break, the Hawks have a quick and tough 3 games. Raanta's performance through this should say a lot. My advice to Q is that when Crow comes back, he should play them like he did Emery and Crow last year. This will only result in good things.

Reasons for not getting time to talk about the Hawks include the pre-winterbreak rush at school and the many outside educational projects I have going on. One such project includes creating the biggest Illinois high school art show ever. Vegas is busy working on his higher education, and so it leaves us with little hockey time. I'm not even playing hockey right now.

So, it would seem posts are going to be fewer and further between these days. Might not be the game-to-game recaps of the past, but I will get here as often as I can to talk about my Blackhawks observations.

Shall We:

In case you didn't already know, the Hawks have one of the best back-checks in the league if not the best. It probably isn't mentioned enough that this is might be the greatest aspect of their game. Obviously stemming from their speed, the Hawks are relentless on opponents breakouts through neutral ice, and this is often the vehicle for a lot the offense they provide. BTW, I do give Q some credit for this approach to their game, but again, the roster is the source.

Not much else to say about this one. I'm not sure if the team finally practiced our not, but they at least had a couple days off before needing to head to Toronto. If they keep a focus, that is a game they should win.

Yep, it was that kind of a domination by the Hawks. More important than purely overwhelming with offensive skill, the Hawks skated hard last night. Roussel might want to take note that giving the Hawks a reason to play hard when your team is the Stars might not be such a great idea. There were few battles lost by the Hawks through the full 60, and they stole more than a handful of pucks with an ease that was almost ridiculous.

It should be pointed out that Dallas was without 3 of their top defensemen, and that this most surely allowed the Hawks more freedom to the net than would have been the case. It also aided in some of the many defensive turnovers by Dallas, resulting from a strong backcheck and forecheck pursuit by the Hawks forwards.

My first item to discuss upon reflection of this game is the play of the newbies. First on that list is Jeremy Morin. Maybe the only reason I can sleep knowing that Pirri was sent back down is that Morin deserves to be here more. The kid is doing everything, and all of it right. The first Saad goal was the result of a play made by Morin. He aggressively stole the puck from Dallas deep in the Hawks zone, and drove the puck all the way to the other end hard. Saad eventually made a great keep, getting the puck back to Morin who made a strong pass to a pinching Kostka. He throws the puck at the net, Shaw drives in to pick up the garbage like he does, and gets the puck to Saad who puts it home. This is a great example of an effort from an entire line and it started with Morin. This was not the exception in Morin's play however, and I'm not sure how he avoided scoring a goal or 2 on the night. His presence has been very important to that line's production and strength. Once again he managed 3 shots on net with the least amount of ice-time on the team.

Ben Smith hasn't been too shabby either. I have made the comment before, and I really mean it when I say that he is making that "4th" line successful. I also think Q is being a little too confident in that formation of Kruger, Smith, and Bollig, but nothing has gone wrong yet. I would note that this line had more ice-time than the Shaw, Saad, Morin line, and Bollig was on the ice more than Saad. I guess in a blowout it doesn't hurt to rest the better players, if that was the reason, but it worries me. Also worth noting, Saad scored twice in only 10 minutes on the ice and is a beast defensively. Anyhow, Smith's hard work and smart sense for the ice has been priceless and allowed Q to play Bollig much more than any of us wants to see.

That brings us to Antti Raanta. So 2 goals against per game is kind of his NHL thing? That last one against seemed willed into the net by some curse against him. The final seconds ticking down, and Shaw tries to make a pass in the Dallas zone that allows the puck back into the Hawks zone, the officials miss calling a blatant too many men by Dallas, who end up with a prime scoring chance and rightfully get it past Raanta. Brain fart by everyone on the ice and Raanta losses the chance to get his goals against below 2. His first goal against was the result of his own brain fart as Raanta seems consistently guilty of one of those per game as well. Nothing a little focus and confidence won't fix. And as he is guilty of a softy every game, you can also bet he will make a few highlight reel saves. It would seem that the possible gain from his athletic abilities far outweigh his few concerns in net. I look forward to watching him clean up his rusty spots and turn into a stellar goaltender.

Hey, Sharp scored 2 beauties! He continues to fly high, as does Keith who made that ridiculous pass to Sharp for his second goal. And since I like to harp on Seabrook when he commits his continuous crimes against hockey, I should point out that he had a very strong game. Maybe not that hard when the entire team is firing on all cylinders, but he still made some great plays last night. And BTW, he is second in the league in plus-minus. Somehow, the guy who is the biggest reason for that isn't even in the top 5, though he is close.

That brings us to Patrick Kane, who is now second in the league in scoring with 40 points in 33 games. His 17 goals are good for 4th in the league. Can I see a 100 point year from Kaner? Either way you look at it, Kane is playing the best hockey of his career, which places him right on the top of the league. I might start calling this the year of Kane, which is following a pretty darn good year for him. Adding a Gold medal to the mix, and another Stanley Cup would solidify that.

Oh, and the Hawks couldn't score on a 2 minute 5-on-3, though they saw some prime chances. They did however pickup a PP goal later and were perfect on the kill which was utilized a bit too much, especially when you are blowing the other team out.

The Hawks have a struggling Philly tonight. Another one of the many back-to-back games for the Hawks and second of three in this month. Since the top 9 forwards had low minutes last night, you would hope they have just the right mix of energy for that contest.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Hostile Hawk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5305:"A 6-2 win that could have looked more like an 8-0 win if Raanta wasn't guilty of 1 softy per game, the officials made the right call before the Stars last goal, and if Bollig could hit an empty net.

This was not the exception in Morin's play however, and I'm not sure how he avoided scoring a goal or 2 on the night. His presence has been very important to that line's production and strength. Once again he managed 3 shots on net with the least amount of ice-time on the team.

Ben Smith hasn't been too shabby either. I have made the comment before, and I really mean it when I say that he is making that "4th" line successful. I also think Q is being a little too confident in that formation of Kruger, Smith, and Bollig, but nothing has gone wrong yet. I would note that this line had more ice-time than the Shaw, Saad, Morin line, and Bollig was on the ice more than Saad. I guess in a blowout it doesn't hurt to rest the better players, if that was the reason, but it worries me. Also worth noting, Saad scored twice in only 10 minutes on the ice and is a beast defensively. Anyhow, Smith's hard work and smart sense for the ice has been priceless and allowed Q to play Bollig much more than any of us wants to see.

That brings us to Antti Raanta. So 2 goals against per game is kind of his NHL thing? That last one against seemed willed into the net by some curse against him. The final seconds ticking down, and Shaw tries to make a pass in the Dallas zone that allows the puck back into the Hawks zone, the officials miss calling a blatant too many men by Dallas, who end up with a prime scoring chance and rightfully get it past Raanta. Brain fart by everyone on the ice and Raanta losses the chance to get his goals against below 2. His first goal against was the result of his own brain fart as Raanta seems consistently guilty of one of those per game as well. Nothing a little focus and confidence won't fix. And as he is guilty of a softy every game, you can also bet he will make a few highlight reel saves. It would seem that the possible gain from his athletic abilities far outweigh his few concerns in net. I look forward to watching him clean up his rusty spots and turn into a stellar goaltender.

Hey, Sharp scored 2 beauties! He continues to fly high, as does Keith who made that ridiculous pass to Sharp for his second goal. And since I like to harp on Seabrook when he commits his continuous crimes against hockey, I should point out that he had a very strong game. Maybe not that hard when the entire team is firing on all cylinders, but he still made some great plays last night. And BTW, he is second in the league in plus-minus. Somehow, the guy who is the biggest reason for that isn't even in the top 5, though he is close.

That brings us to Patrick Kane, who is now second in the league in scoring with 40 points in 33 games. His 17 goals are good for 4th in the league. Can I see a 100 point year from Kaner? Either way you look at it, Kane is playing the best hockey of his career, which places him right on the top of the league. I might start calling this the year of Kane, which is following a pretty darn good year for him. Adding a Gold medal to the mix, and another Stanley Cup would solidify that.

Oh, and the Hawks couldn't score on a 2 minute 5-on-3, though they saw some prime chances. They did however pickup a PP goal later and were perfect on the kill which was utilized a bit too much, especially when you are blowing the other team out.

The Hawks have a struggling Philly tonight. Another one of the many back-to-back games for the Hawks and second of three in this month. Since the top 9 forwards had low minutes last night, you would hope they have just the right mix of energy for that contest.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

The Hawks played well as was expected, and ended their little drought with a big win.

It didn't help the Panthers that they played the night before and their back-up Clemmensen got the start against a powerhouse offense, which pretty much delivered on it's expectations. One of the things that I would like to point out is that the Hawks had some good movement out of their own zone, because of short quick passes. They looked much, much better than in the past few games, and this was a glaring difference for me. We don't need stretch passes all of the time. Not only did it result in goals, but it kept everyone closer to their D-men who have been getting caught alone far too often.

Of course, it was nice to see Shaw back in action. I'm not sure we give him enough credit, and we give him a lot of credit. And, I would like to add my enthusiasm for watching Morin play. There is definitely a point to be made that he deserves to be here more than Pirri. Too bad he isn't a center, not that Q wouldn't try it.

While on prospects playing regularly, I can't help but feel Smith is keeping that 4th line from busting down. Q might be getting over-confident in them, but Smith works hard enough for everyone.

And then there is that Crawford injury that is overshadowing the whole game. Q said, it isn't terrible, but Rockford goaltender Kent Simpson was recalled today. Oh man, that Khabi deal just looks worse and worse as the season goes on. Can't say we didn't see that coming. And, the Hawks are kind of stuck here. If Crow was to remain out for a long while, the Hawks really don't have any purchasing power since the Versteeg deal was made. We got Kris cheap, but not cheap enough to afford a decent goaltender.

In steps Raanta much quicker than anyone, including himself, thought. You got to hand it to him, he handles the situation well. As a supporter of his potential, I can't say I'm overly enthusiastic about the situation. Raanta has had some rocky moments, and given up some weak goals. However, he has made some highlight saves and he's consistent. In all of his games, Raanta has given up 2 goals and sported a .922 save percentage. That's not bad at all.

The good news is that his issues are very serviceable, and have little to do with mechanics. He obviously needed more time to get used to American hockey, but let's hope he is a fast learner. Raanta has it in him to be great. Sure, his puck management skills in close are rough, but he also shows a natural skating ability mixed with good puck control outside his crease. His only issue is managing the puck, and using his stick as an extension of his body in tight situations, especially to cover his 5-hole. Throw in a little positioning concerns. But that's all that seems to be worth mentioning. Overall, he is a very athletic goaltender who is confident on his skates.

<em><strong>And then there is</strong> <strong>this:</strong></em>

Speaking of injuries, has anyone seen the debacle that went down between Boston and Pittsburgh? If you haven't, resident thug Shawn Thornton yanked Brooks Orpik to the ground from behind, sucker punched him in the head a couple of times, and Orpik was carried off in a stretcher. That is about as sugar coated as I could describe the felony Thornton committed. This came much after a hit Orpik had made on Loui Eriksson, which seemed legal, just hard. Thornton tried to start a fight at that time, and Orpik declined, as he should, because fighting is barbaric and laying body checks is hockey.

Anyway, later on in the game, Brad Marchand fell to the ice after being tripped by Crosby, and James Neal of Pittsburgh very obviously skated his knee into the back of Marchand's head intentionally. A scrum ensued at the other end of the ice, which is when Thornton decided to abuse a completely defenseless Orpik.

We are left once again watching a player carried off in a stretcher because of the disgusting antics of so called enforcers and cheap shots. Since the NHL is currently looking at a lawsuit surrounding concussions, one might expect them to attempt regulations that would keep them from looking foolish and embarrassing. Neal has already been suspended for 5 games. It is my opinion that Thornton shouldn't play hockey for the rest of the season. I also think he should face criminal charges. It was that bad.

Cut back to the Hawks game last night, when Bollig fought Florida's Barch after a hard hit on Kruger. This was the second really hard hit on Kruger, and both seemed legal to me. In fact, Kruger's attempt to avoid the second hit made it look worse for him. Okay, so here we go. Did Bollig's presence on the ice keep Kruger from getting nailed? No. I ask as I have many times before, what purpose this idea of an enforcer has in policing hockey? I'm not trying to throw Bollig under the bus, and am in no way comparing his fight with Barch to what Thornton did. But, I did take offense at the way Bollig performed like a wrestler after his fight, trying to get the crowd going. You know what gets me excited about hockey? Watching good hockey.

Again, I think Bollig has done well this season, and I'm not throwing him under the bus, but these fights are sideshows that don't belong in this sport anymore, and how neanderthal to suggest it the game more safe. Enforcers don't keep injuries from happening, they cause them. The idea that Orpik should have to fight Thornton for making a good hit is ridiculous. The idea that Bollig on the ice keeps Kane, and guy not even on his line from getting hit hard is just as ridiculous, because he can't even keep the guy on his line from getting destroyed. Because that's what stopped Torres from being a goon, right?
