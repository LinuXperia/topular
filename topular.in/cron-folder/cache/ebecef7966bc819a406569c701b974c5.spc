<p>    Once again my friend Paul Ogden has written an inaccurate assessment of the jurisprudence of those with whom he disagrees.  Mr. Ogden prefers the originalism—a term, apparently, he does not like—of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.  Any theory by which one construes our Nation’s Constitution, its interplay with statutes, the constitutions of the 46 States and four Commonwealths (Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Massachusetts), their statutes, as well as the various treaties into which the United States has entered, and other matters, are easily determined by taking the WABAC Machine to 1787 and looking at the Constitution through the eyes of the white, male landowners who convened in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 to act outside the charter given them by the Congress to make corrections to the Articles of Confederation. <br/>    What those men did, of course, was write the Constitution.<br/>    Today I will not address, again, the shortcomings of originalism. I did so in Sunday’s blog.  Mr. Ogden can fire up his Commodore 64, set his land-line on the rubber modem, dial up the internet, and read that blog. (Okay—I am the neo-Luddite.)<br/>    Instead, I want briefly to address his claim that those who oppose originalism have only an ad hoc method of judicial interpretation of the Constitution.<br/>    I have quoted previously from “Constitutional Interpretation,” 3d ed., 1983, p. vii, by Ducat and Chase:<br/>      “Constitutional interpretation is not a static enterprise which presents the prospect of furnishing correct, certain, or ultimate legal answers to political problems but, rather, one of a continual adjustment of tensions through a process of unending dialogue among judges of fundamentally different political faiths and experiences.”<br/>Interpretation of the Constitution consists of various elements.  Of course the words of the Constitution itself are important. What the Framers intended, however, does not control, necessarily, what the words mean today.  <br/>    One significant series of events consisted of the way in which the Constitution effectively protected the institution of slavery, the decades between the ratification of the Constitution, the Civil War, and the so-called Civil War Amendments.  The Fourteenth Amendment fundamentally altered the concept of federalism and gave protection to citizens of their rights to due process of law in the event a State sought to deny the person or class of persons that due process.  In other words, the Federal government trumped the governments of the States.  One must consider such developments when one interprets the Constitution. <br/>    Another element of interpretation of the Constitution is the passage of time and the evolution of our society.  There were some 60-plus offenses punishable by death in the time of the Constitutional Convention.  A seven-year-old child could be subject to the death penalty.  Our society has advanced.  Only two (2) offenses, to the best of my knowledge, are punishable by death in the United States today.  One is murder—with special circumstances.  The other is treason.  <br/>    A lot of people refer today to the idea that “unelected” persons—especially justices of the United States Supreme Court, and judges of the United States Court of Appeals and the United States district courts, all of whom are appointed for life—should not make decisons that affect us all and so significantly.  There are two (2) points to consider.  First, one the Framers of the Constitution—the people to whom, presumably, Mr. Ogden would look to guidance as to what the people who wrote the Constitution meant as they were the ones who chose the words employed in the document—Alexander Hamilton, wrote six of the last of the 85 essays of The Federalist Papers, the essays written to persuade the public to support the Constitution, specifically about the courts.  As one of  Hamilton’s biographers wrote:<br/>    “Throughout [Hamilton’s] career, he showed special solicitude for an independent judiciary, which he thought the most important guardian of minority rights but also the weakest of the three branches of government: ‘[It commands neither the press nor the sword.  It has scarcely any patronage.’  He was especially intent that the federal judiciary check any legislative abuses.  In [Federalist Paper] number 78, Hamilton introduced an essential concept, never made explicit in the Constitution: that the Supreme Court should be able to review and overturn legislation as unconstitutional.  At Philadelphia, delegates had concentrated on the question of state versus federal courts, not whether courts could invalidate legislation.  Here, Hamilton bluntly affirmed that ‘no legislative act ... contrary to the constitution can be valid,’ laying the intellectual groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review later promulgated by Supreme Court justice John Marshall.”<br/>Chernow, “Alexander Hamilton,” 2004, p. 259.  <br/>    The legislatures, to which Mr. Ogden would so readily defer, were the bodies of which the Framers feared would be most prone to abuse of rights.<br/>    Second, Brown v. Board of Education I—as I have written several times—never would have occurred if Justices of the Supreme Court were elected officials.  That 9-0 decision was one of the most significant, if not the most significant, event to slam segregation in this country.<br/>    Mr. Ogden’s jurisprudence—his philosophy of law—is quaint.  Mr. Ogden has an interesting, idyllic view reminiscent of bygone days.  His belief that those who do not share his philosophy is misplaced.  Interpretation of the Constitution is far more complex than Mr. Ogden would have it—fortunately.<br/><br/></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>    The decision of Texas public officials not to perform an autopsy on the body of the late Justice Antonin Scalia is imprudent.<br/>    First, one should realize autopsies are unpleasant for the novice observer, and unpleasant for survivors of the deceased.  I have not witnessed an autopsy in person, but have read quite a few autopsy reports, primarily during work on appeals of homicide convictions. A “Y” is cut into the thorax of the body, the organs examined, and photographs taken.  The skull “cap” usually is removed and the brain weighed.  Samples of fluids from the body are analyzed. Given these unpleasant aspects of the procedure, one can understand how most people’s loved ones would be averse to the subjection of the remains of a deceased family member to the Stryker® saw of the coroner of a remote county in Texas.<br/>    The body in question here, though, is that of a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Questions have been raised as to Justice Scalia’s cause of death.<br/>    If a person is a high-ranking government official—and I reasonably believe the Justice of the United States Supreme Court qualifies as such an official—in the event of the death of that person while in office, an autopsy should standard procedure.  The Washington Post has reported Justice Scalia’s body was found with a pillow over the late Justice’s head. <br/>    Justice Scalia was 79 years old. He was not a “spring chicken.”  Nonetheless, given his position, the political ramifications of his death, and even the slightest indicia of foul play, the decision, as I understand made by a Justice of the Peace, was inappropriate. That decision now will pop up in debate over Justice Scalia’s replacement for the next few months and on internet blogs for the next few decades (or until AI computers take over our society).</p>
<p>As this blog is written, the decision has been not to perform an autopsy. I hope that decision is reversed.<br/>    Also, a brief note on history: Andrew Jackson’s people successfully blocked the appointment, by President John Quincy Adams, of John J. Crittenden to the United States Supreme Court.  There were ideological reasons for the “block,” as Jackson’s populist policies were at odds with the views and actions of Adams.  There also were personal reasons for Jackson’s reaction to anything done by Adams.  However, Adams nominated Crittenden “on December 17, 1828, after the the Electoral College had formally chosen Andrew Jackson to succeed Adams as President.”  riceonhistory.wordpress.com.  The vacancy on the Court had existed since Justice Robert Trimble’s death on August 25, 1828. The circumstances in that case are substantively different from the present circumstances, where we are a few days less than nine (9) months from the presidential election and a little under a year away from inauguration.<br/>    I pose one final question.

<p>    With the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, many more people seem aware of what Professor Sheila Suess Kennedy had pointed out on February 3, 2016, on her blog, the Supreme Court is the most important issue for voters in the 2016 election. <br/>    The impact of Justice Scalia’s death on the presidential campaign already has been felt and is, and will continue to be, significant.  Senator Mitch McConnell vowed that a nominee of President Obama will not be approved; that the confirmation will occur only after the November election so that the American people can make the choice.<br/>    First, the American people twice chose to elect President Obama, in contrast with his predecessor, George W. Bush, who was awarded the Oval Office by—yes, the institution is that important—the United States Supreme Court.<br/>    Second, when people speak of “entitlements,” those of the right-wing usually speak of Social Security (to which I have contributed all my working life), Medicare (see previous parenthetical comment), and miscellaneous welfare programs for the poor (the concept and existence of which I support). As I listened to various commentators and elected officials last evening and read comments this morning, I was struck by the right wing’s sense of entitlement to a majority on the Supreme Court.<br/>    Third, Justice Scalia, for all his jurisprudential quirks, was generally well-liked by colleagues and clerks. Those jurisprudential quirks, however, have left us with a concept for interpretation of the United States Constitution known as “originalism.” He believed the Constitution should be interpreted as the words were used by The Framers in 1787.  There are several problems with this jurisprudence, as I have pointed out several times in this blog. First, who were The Framers? Were they the 36 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention who signed the Constitution?  Do the Framers include the other three delegates present who refused to sign (although two later signed)? Included amongst the Framers—to whom we look for “intent” in originalism—do we include all 55 delegates who, at one time or another, attended the Convention?  What of the 18 men chosen as delegates, some of whom refused to attend?  There was fear felt by some (e.g., Patrick Henry, who said he “smelt a rat” in Philadelphia) that the Constitutional Convention would act outside its charter—to make improvements to, and not engage to scrap completely, the Articles of Confederation—something the Convention did.  Do we include the delegates to the various State constitutional conventions? One would infer we only could include white, male, landowners.  Deists and Protestants predominated at the Convention in Philadelphia.  Thomas FitzSimmons appears to have been the only Roman Catholic.  Women could not vote in most places.  No women were delegates.  The unspoken compromise of the Convention—to permit the continuance of the evil institution of slavery—meant people held in bondage had no voice. Do we discount their views? Second, even if we can identify the Framers upon whose intent we would base an interpretation, can we discern that intent? Third, as to such a means of interpretation, we should turn to the writings of James Madison, who “kept the most extensive notes during the course of the Convention, [and] also refused to published hs journal until after his death.”: “...till the Constitution should be well settled by practice, and till a knowledge of the controversial part of the proceedings of its framers could be turned to no proper account... As a guide in expounding and applying the provisions of the Constitution, the debates and incidental decisions of the Convention can have no authoritative character.”  Teuber, “Original Intent or How Does the Constitution Mean?” 10 London Review of Books 7, March 1988. In other words, the Framers, upon whose “intent” originalism focuses, did not believe their “intent” should be a guide. Finally, what of the amendments that have been made to the Constitution? The so-called Civil War Amendments, particularly the Fourteenth, inherently were at odds with the original document—or else they would not have been “amendments.”  Inclusion of the process of amendment itself indicates the Framers did not view theirs as a work written in stone.<br/>    There is another problem that looms in the composition of the members of the Court.  Mortality tables carry a degree of reliability. Other Justices on the Court are very old. It is possible another Justice could pass away before the November elections. <br/>    The composition of the Court, as an issue, will figure in an election campaign as it has none during my life.  Nixon spoke of the ravages on society wrought by the Warren Court.  FDR’s threats to “pack” the Court backfired on FDR and were fodder for his opponents. Yet this nomination could be the most important and dominant issue in November.  If another vacancy on the Court should occur, the implications are scary.     I really hope we do not receive a lecture on the structure of the United States Supreme Court from former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Gosh, that might make me want to wretch.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

The political leaders of the city in which I live decided long ago to subsidize, with money obtained from our tax dollars, professional sports franchise owners. The National Football League® is a —try not to choke on your food as you read this—not-for-profit corporation. The owners of the 32 franchises enjoy exemption from antitrust laws. When the NFL® comes to town for the Super Bowl®, the host city gives up more taxes and submits to diva-esque requirements.<br/>   We should not be empathetic to the NFL® or its franchise owners. <br/>   The Indianapolis Colts® now have been in Indianapolis longer than the franchise was located in Baltimore. <br/>   I have a conflict when I watch NFL® games today. Players hobble away, after years of play, with various injuries that include brain trauma. The number of players who make it to the NFL®, after college and high school and junior high and leagues for players even younger, means a lot of people have been injured. The NFL® owners get the profits. Still, I have become acculturated to football. I was a Chicago Bears® fan in years past. After I moved to Indy in 1986, the Indianapolis Colts® grew on me.<br/>   On Sunday, October 18, Indianapolis will host the New England Patriots®.  The New England Patriots cheat. They have been caught in the act on a couple of occasions.<br/>   One possibility the Patriots are evil could be rooted in their coach, Bill Belichek, and their quarterback, Tom Brady, being cold and bloodless. In other words, they could be some of the “undead,” i.e., vampires.<br/>   On October 18, fans of the Indianapolis Colts® should wear cloves of garlic on strings around their necks. <br/>   I am convinced that the coach of the Patriots®, and others in the organization, are vampires—or at least exhibit vampire tendencies. They have developed some resistance to sunlight. I do not know how. Also, has anyone seen Coach Belichek or quarterback Brady stand before a mirror? I do not mean images of them on TV doing so because they have access to video equipment, like the stuff they used to spy on the practices of the St. Louis Rams® prior to the 2002 Super Bowl®.<br/>   If everyone wears a garland of garlic for the game, the “other team” might be thrown “off.” Quartback Brady’s balls—footballs—might shrink. Coach Belichek might have to seek refuge under the false turf in Lucas Oil Stadium®.<br/>   If this works and the Indianapolis Colts® win—great. Either way, people will have cloves of garlic to take home and use for meals.<br/>   Besides, Lucas Oil Stadium® will smell great.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   If I were made head of the GOP, there are several moves I would push.<br/>   Please realize I am not registered as a person who has voted Republican in any elections. I have voted for some candidates from the “R” party, but the number of those is relatively small. I have found the Democratic Party to have some bad candidates. In some races, in the general election, I have left blank the vote for a particular office. If the candidate of another party is on the ballot, I seriously consider her or him. Otherwise, a blank for a particular office represents a vote of “none of the above” in a system that, too often, gives us a choice of the lesser of two evils.   <br/>   The Republican process of winnowing out candidates for President of the United States is an example of how we end up with the candidates in the general elections. I would attempt to make several  changes. For purposes of this discussion, let us consider my power would be sufficient—that any changes to the laws of particular States, in regard to those States’ primaries, would be made.<br/>   First, I would cut out this nonsense of early debates. In other words, I would shorten the season. Voters get numbed and bored enough. To see debates, in late summer of 2015, for an election some 14 months or so away is counter-productive to the candidates and the GOP. People’s sensibilities can be deadened by overexposure to a particular stimulus. In this case, voters become bored with the “show” of the election.  Voters do not become better-informed about issues. I do not believe the political discourse was improved by Donald Trump’s views on the aesthetics of Carly Fiorino. The first debates would be held a month before the first primary or caucus.<br/>   Second, consolidate primaries in such fashion that States like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina—outliers as it were—lose their status as a screen of the first candidates to quit. Iowa’s caucuses do not even result in the actual delegates to their State’s convention. The results of small group dynamics in which people are bullied should not set the tone for our national election. New Hampshire has the tradition of being the first primary. One should consider presidential primaries are relatively recent on the political scene. New Hampshire can lose that little niche and the rest of the Nation will be safe. South Carolina as an early litmus test/hurdle is silly. This is a State that tried to secede from the Union—before 1861. People there should have the right to vote for whomever they wish—questions about voter ID laws aside—but should not have the power to eliminate candidates early in the primary season. Yesterday I heard, on NPR, a Republican strategist predict Rand Paul would be the next candidate to drop out of the race. I might disagree with Senator Paul’s positions on a lot of the issues, but he has a clear ideology. If we want an election with a real choice of ideologies, instead of a general election in which the candidates of the two major parties are fueled by the same small group of corporations and wealthy individuals, we would have Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont run on the Democratic ticket versus Senator Paul from the GOP.   <br/>   My Libertarian friends, and others, suggest the State should not be involved in the primary election process at all. We can discuss that argument—and the proponents of that position have good points—at another time. Now we have the reality of primaries.<br/>   Third I would seek to have primaries’ schedules condensed. Maybe we could have three waves of primaries, with rotation each four years of what State are in what waves. Perhaps we could have one primary weekend. The first, our perhaps only, primary would be no earlier than the first part of May. Wait—I do not want to screw up the Indianapolis 500 Festival® and the lead up to the Greatest Spectacle in Motor Racing®. Okay, then make the first primary no earlier than the first of June.<br/>   Finally, I would ban the grainy, opposing candidates mouth moving in slow-mo commercials. I know there is a First Amendment to consider, but I would not be a governmental entity. I would be the head of the GOP. Those ads do nothing to educate the public about the issues.<br/>   Oh, one more point: I would ask the GOP to recognize the New York Yankees and Bill Belichek are evil. First, because they are. Second, those States are pretty blue.<br/>   These simply are suggestions. In the absurd circus of the campaign so far, people have lost track of issues—and the one big, juicy conspiracy out there. With all the millions in the Clinton war chest, and with Trump’s past positions as antithetical to the GOP voter “base” such as those positions have been, has anyone given thought to the notion Donald Trump is a plant?

<p>   In June, on the morning of my birthday, I had an appointment with a neurologist, at IU Clarian North.  A too-long drive was one of several reasons I had decided to switch neurologists. <br/>   My reality has been shaped, significantly, since January, 1994, when I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I have blogged previously about the events that led up to the diagnosis. By the second day of what became a nine-day stay in the hospital, I was paralyzed from the waist down. I could not walk. Initially I was put on steroids.<br/>   I was wheeled all around the hospital for tests. Each time a nurse, therapist, doctor, or phlebotomist would ask what I had. Each time, seated in the wheelchair, I would choke up as I answered, “Multiple sclerosis.”  <br/>   The neurologist who diagnosed had the benefit of: (1) the results of four MRIs and a lumbar puncture—or spinal tap; (2) labs from numerous vials of blood sucked out of me; (3) reports from various other tests; and (4) consultation with a neurologist who was viewed as the MS guru of Indiana. I was told the MRI results were clear: I had plaque on the myelin sheath of my central nervous system. The findings of the LP were significant for MS. The blood work and the CT scans and all the other tests confirmed. Also, the onset of symptoms had been so marked, MS was almost definite. Only with an autopsy could they be more certain and, as I told the first neurologist, I thought an autopsy, in my case, was premature. He didn’t laugh—and here I thought I had a pretty good one-liner. <br/>   I asked to see the MRIs. I never was shown them.  I know. I am a lawyer. I had a right to see my medical records. I also had been given a traumatic diagnosis and was whacked out on drugs. <br/>   I read about MS. I also read about the economics of MS. One 1994 article said an MS patient represented approximately $250,000.00, over the course of a patent’s life to a lucky neurologist. In 1994 new, expensive drugs for treatment of MS were introduced—it seemed like every week. MS is easily misdiagnosed.  Few can fault a physician who prescribes a wonder drug for a patient who faces a disease or condition that progresses as far as MS can go. <br/>   I switched neurologists. I went to Dr. Guru. In his office, people sat in wheelchairs, some from as far away as Maine and Florida—as Dr. Guru told me—because his success rate, as reflected by the average number of exacerbations, or “attacks” of MS, each year, was so low: 0.22. I thought that was great. <br/>   Shortly after my release from the hospital, I was on crutches. I discarded those and began to walk in the morning. I decided to try the Indianapolis 500 Festival Mini-Marathon®. I walked the 13.1 miles, in 1999, in under three hours. I promised myself I would continue to do the Mini until either I was dead or I beat MS. I would not let MS “beat” me. I was pro-active in how I addressed the situation. Dr. Guru seemed mildly amused by my efforts at exercise. Then, during one of my appointments with him, he said he had read a study by French researchers that indicated aerobic exercise helps to fight MS.<br/>   Dr. Guru seemed always to participate in a “blind study,” of which selected patients of Dr. Guru’s office were a part. Oddly, I seemed always to be a subject. I believe I was in four such studies. Dr. Guru wanted me to remain on the steroids and to take intramuscular shots of beta interferon. I said “no” to the steroids. After years of painful injections each week, I quit the interferon.  <br/>  I switched neurologists in about 2006. My new neurologist did the usual tests for an MS visit. Those consist of components of the field sobriety tests administered by law enforcement in traffic stops of suspected impaired drivers, plus the doctor runs the handle of the mallet for knee tests along the underside of my feet, to gauge sensation. I automatically remove my shoes and socks as I wait for the doctor. This neurologist was surprised my injections of interferon, when I still had done them, were intramuscular—a very painful means of injection. She said I could inject the interferon subcutaneously, in the fat on my belly, far less painfully. She moved her practice. I stopped the interferons because I saw no need to take them. The next neurologist told me, up front, MS was not her specialty. That was cool with me. I was tired of the search. <br/>  In the summer of 2010, I felt light-headed and dizzy from the heat. I was concerned perhaps the MS—a condition not conducive to heat—had decided to spring up.  I was put through an MRI. The neuro told me there was no indication of an exacerbation or active inflammation. I was curious, though, and asked, “Does it show I have MS?” She said there was no doubt I had MS.<br/>   None of these doctors showed me the MRIs or any other items from my file. I requested a copy of my file from Dr. Guru, but he had retired at the time of my request (2010) and my records were gone. The records from 1994 no longer existed.  <br/>  I decided to switch neurologists at the beginning of this year. The office of the neurologist whom I had been seeing for about eight years was 40 miles away. My health insurance required I get a GP and that the GP refer me to a neurologist. I did all that. The appointment with my new neurologist was set for the morning of my birthday.<br/>   That morning, I waited in the examination room, shoes and socks already off. This neurologist entered the room, ignored my feet, did a few of the tests—horizontal gaze nystagmus is an old favorite of mine—and looked at the file. <br/>   He asked me who diagnosed me, whether that physician had run any MRIs, whether that physician had done a spinal tap, and if I was treated by anyone else. I identified the physician who diagnosed me, said yes to the other questions, and told him I had been treated for about ten years by Dr. Guru.<br/>  “Did he have you on a lot of steroids?” the doctor asked.<br/>   I said no, and explained how I had refrained from prednizone and interferons, for years by now.<br/>   The neurologist shook his head, sort of grinned, glanced at the file, and said, “I don’t think you have MS.” There was a pause. I was stunned. He continued, “MS is a progressive disease. You get worse. From what I can tell, you only have had one exacerbation.” I said that was correct. “You might have a rare form of MS called benign MS. I don’t think so. But no interferons for years?” I nodded. “That actually is very good. Otherwise I would have thought the lack of progression of the disease could be attributed to the drugs. I want to get some blood work and run some MRIs. If there’s plaque on the myeline sheath, then I’m wrong and you have MS.”<br/>   I went downstairs to have blood drawn. <br/>  Now I sat in the chair and the phlebotomist prepped my arm for the “stick.” She had a bunch of vials lined up. The doctor wanted to run a lot of tests. I felt deja vu—only seated in a blood donor chair instead of a wheelchair like in 1994.<br/>   “You have a lot of scar tissue inside your elbow,” she observed. <br/>   “I used to donate a lot,” I said. “Then I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.”<br/>   “You can’t donate after that,” she said. Her tone was polite. She stated a fact.<br/>    The scene was a flashback to 1994. “I might be able to now. I was just told...” and I choked out the words “might not have MS” before I could not talk because I was crying. <br/>   She was cool. She smiled. She stuck me, and I didn’t feel it. She said I’d be okay. She wished me the best. Once the last vial was full—I think she took eight vials, total—she put the cotton on the spot, wrapped the tape around my arm, and gave me some tissues. <br/>   I walked out of there and across the lobby. I did my best to smile.  After all, there were people there, I was pretty sure, who were facing bad news for themselves or a loved one. They did not need to see someone else in tears. And mine were tears of joy. <br/>   I got to my car, started the engine, turned on the AC, and sat. Finally, I called a colleague. I told her that I had just seen my new neurologist, that I had really great news, but not to be alarmed because, as I told her the news, I would cry.<br/>   My statement was not accurate. I did not merely cry—I sobbed. My chest heaved. Between gasps I told her the diagnosis under which I had lived for 21 ½ years possibly no longer was true. By the end of the call, she was sobbing, too.<br/>   I drove back to my office and called a couple more friends. I was holding it together better. At the office I told everyone, then I left, unable to accomplish anything that day.<br/>   People met up with me, as we had planned for about a week, at Flatwater, then, after 4, at The Village Cigar. I still don’t know who ordered the hooker—or if the woman with the very polite, sexy voice who called me on my flip-phone was a hooker, or someone hired to play the voice role of hooker. I thanked her, told her I thought she was sweet, but politely declined those services.<br/>   People who have been my friends, in some instances for over thirty years, showed up. Half of them were in tears when they got the news.<br/>   I was in bed by 8:30. I crash early. The birthday was one of my best ever.<br/>   On July 23 I had the MRIs. Two were for compare-and-contrast. One was with dye. I waited for the results, but not too anxiously. I was pretty sure what those results would be. A couple of weeks later I received a call from the doctor’s office. The nurse told me: “There was absolutely no trace of MS on the MRIs.” I asked her to repeat what she had said. I set an appointment to see my neurologist.. <br/>   On August 27 I met with him. He grinned as he entered the examination room. He told me I do not have, and never had, multiple sclerosis. I probably had a virus, the traces of which were long gone. He not only showed me the results, but gave me copies without my having to request them. <br/>   I still experience effects from whatever it was I had. Some are of a personal nature. Also, I am extremely sensitive to high temperatures, but the numbness in my feet disappeared shortly after the mercury amalgam fillings in my teeth were replaced with porcelain. I fatigue in the late morning, but lying down for 20 minutes helps.<br/>   On August 27 the neurologist asked, “Is that a big load off your mind to not have MS?”<br/>   I said no. It was a complete change of how I had identified myself for years. <br/>   In 1994 I was paralyzed from the waist down. All that happened. When I have walked the Mini®, it is with a sense of challenge. <br/>   In 2016 I shall walk my 18th consecutive Mini®, but this time I shall do so without that “foe” of MS. I was misdiagnosed—I understand. Also, though, I was pro-active, refused the interferons, and, as a result, was diagnosed as having never had MS. I feel I beat MS.<br/>   Each year, as I approach the finish line at The Mini®, I tear up as I remember the hospital in 1994 and how hard I worked to get out of the chair and onto my feet. This year, I might cry more—or laugh, I’m not sure which. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   The headline on the front page of IBJ reads: “TIF glitch may imperil projects in Midtown.”  (IBJ, Vol. 36, No. 27, p. 1.)  The article carries over to page 39. <br/>   After a description of projects lined up to use TIF funds, the tone of the article echoed the headline. A $39 million development aimed for the area around College Avenue and Kessler “would bring much-needed density along the corridor that is part of a planned rapid-transit route running from Carmel to Greenwood.”  (Id., p. 1.)<br/>   What is the “glitch” that imperils the plan?<br/>   TIFs (Tax Increment Financing districts) were created in California in the 1950s to develop urban wastelands where private enterprise otherwise would not develop. A line is drawn around a TIF area to be developed—a footprint—and bonds are issued to pay for development within the footprint. As the article notes: “Additional property taxes generated by new development in TIF districts go toward paying off bonds issued to cover government subsidies that make new developments feasible.”  (IBJ, p. 39.)  <br/>   A few paragraphs down we learn there was a “change in state interpretation of residential values” that “resulted in a $4.4 million loss in base assessed value for the district, crippling its ability to support new projects.”  (Id.) As it turns out, the “2013 administrative change become (sic) apparent to municipalities only this February, when the state upgraded software.” (Id.) <br/>   This is where we get close to an explanation of the problem, as explained by Michael McKillip, executive director “of not-for-profit Midtown Indianapolis, Inc.”  <br/>   We know Mr. McKillip will be objective about the matter since he is the executive director of a not-for-profit. (One example of a not-for-profit corporation is the National Football League®, and we know how altruistic and non-profit-driven the folks in that organization are.)  As eporter Scott Olson writes:<br/>      “Even though TIFs cannot capture tax revenue from increases in the assessed values of residential properties, the state change still hampers TIF districts with a lot of residences. <br/>      That’s because residences within TIF districts now are assessed individually rather than collectively, and on net value (after homestead and mortgage exemptions) rather than gross value.” (Id.)<br/>   Apparently, private developers in an area of the city want to tax residents more—they want a new formula whereby residences would be taxed collectively; and maybe we can do away with the homestead exemption while we are at it—to free up money for their projects.<br/>   City services still are needed in TIF districts. It is unfortunate for the developers in question that so many residences lie within their boundaries.  <br/>   No one is quoted as questioning the plans. No one seems to wonder why TIFs are used in areas where development will occur without subsidies—e.g., Broad Ripple—and areas like the former Meadows are ignored. <br/>   And when did anyone approve this mass transit corridor to run through Broad Ripple to connect Carmel and Greenwood?  Did we have a referendum? <br/>   TIFs were made illegal in California for a reason. They become too easily abused by developers who take the money and leave—leave the debt of bond repayment to the taxpayers. They are cancers that put local governments and those governments' taxpayers on metaphorical chemotherapy.<br/>   TIFs are a gimmick that replace prudent city fiscal planning with something like magic.  And, as Vernon Dursley sais in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”: “There is no such thing as magic!” I would add—especially when it comes to municipal fiscal planning. <br/>  </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   A trip to the Indiana State Fair in the early 1960s was a festive event. The place seemed huge to young eyes. There were a lot of pieces of farm and construction equipment. In the livestock barns, the old man would point out the various breeds of cattle, sheep, and goats and explain why each was unique as the kids who were there to show the animals sweated and lounged on bales of straw or fold-out chairs. The really big room with aluminum siding sales pitches was okay. On the midway, some of the rides were bigger than the county fair, but that about it.<br/>   Of course there was the food. The various tents of a fair give off a one-of-a-kind smoke/smell. Some of the food sucks, some appeals to the tastes of some people and not others, and some is simply funny. <br/>   There were a lot of vendors of crap. I bought a Budweiser t-shirt when I was 11.  That was my “gateway” t-shirt. There also were tents where one could buy cowboy hats, belts, and belt buckles. In the mix of the belt buckles and shirts and Zippo® lighters were familiar images—the Stars and Bars of the flag of the Confederate States of America.<br/>   This year, for the first time in about 25 years, attendance of YOUR Indiana State Fair is not one of life’s requisites.  I will not miss the eat and dust (although August could be as wet as June and July). I stopped doing the rides years ago. I am a city dweller now and have no interest in farm equipment or live stock. <br/>   I am curious, however, about the issue of the sale of goods on which the Stars and Bars figures prominently.<br/>    First, the Confederacy was not an experiment in assertion of States’ rights. That people, not States, have rights, is reflected in the Declaration of Independence: “WE hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness—That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the consent of the Governed...” <br/>   The concept that government exists by the consent of the governed gave rise to the modern—as in since the 1700s—concept of government. The notion that States—governmental entities—possess rights is antithetical to this notion. If a government—a State—has rights, it is on a par with, not subservient to, its creators—people. Therefore, States have no rights.<br/>   Second, the Civil War was a complex development in American history. Decades had produced divisions that erupted.  The Civil War was fought for various reasons. One area of concern was “States’ rights.” The “right” in question was cited, in resolutions that accompanied secession votes, by four of the States that seceded from the Union. The “right” was the “right” of citizens to own as chattel other human beings.  Texas, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Georgia specifically cited the threat posed to the institution of slavery as the reason for secession. <br/>   President Lincoln sought to preserve the Union. Unfortunately, he did not press for abolition of slavery. That abolition was a necessary outcome of the Civil War became obvious as fighting continued far longer than leaders on either side had anticipated. The Civil War amendments were enacted and adopted. They ended slavery and sought to protect the rights of individuals against the States. <br/>   Third, the States of the Confederacy committed treason in their effort to preserve the most evil institution ever to be memorialized in our Constitution.  The “Great Compromise” was not the compromise that resulted in small States having equal representation in the Senate and members of the House of Representatives being distributed based on States’ populations----in which, for purposes of calculation, “all other Persons” were counted as three-fifths of a person, Art. I, Sec. 1, para. 3—but on the topic of slavery.  Twenty of the fifty-five delegates, who attended at one time or another, the 1787 Convention, claimed ownership over other human beings.  (I will footnote, or otherwise cite support, later for historical references in this blog.)  <br/>   The Civil War ended. A lot of people died in what was not a “war” declared by the United States Congress. To have done so would have been to recognize the Confederacy and lend it legitimacy. The “Stars and Bars” of the Confederate flag is a bitter reminder to many of those years of slavery as well as the years of oppression that followed.<br/>    The Indiana State Fair is funded, in large part, by public funds. Vendors sign contracts to rent space. I wonder if anyone has spoken to the vendors of leather belts and t-shirts and said, “We do not want merchandise of the Confederacy sold at the Indiana State Fair.”<br/>   I believe in free speech.  If a group touting itself as The Sons of the Confederacy—or the Ku Klux Klan or some form of American Nazi Party, for that matter—applied for, and was denied, space at YOUR Indiana State Fair, I think members of that group would have valid grounds to seek redress in the Federal or State courts for violation of their constitutional rights and injunctive relief requiring they be allowed space. I would not represent groups that would seek such action—this blog could be construed as solicitation of a case, and that is prohibited by Indiana’s Rules of Professional Conduct—but there are lawyers who could and would (including probably the ACLU) represent those groups. Each year I have passed anti-choice religious groups who have tents just off 38th Street across from the exposition building.  I find the messages of those groups offensive—and protected by our Federal and State constitutions.<br/>   Vendors of t-shirts and belt buckles, however, are not selling such items for ideological reasons, any more than they sell door mats with cute sayings about cats and dogs because they are advocates for animal rights (or maybe they would not sell the cheap leather belts). Any free speech considerations are incidental to their general sale of merchandise.<br/>   As I wrote earlier in this blog, I will not attend this year’s State Fair. To address the question of whether officials of YOUR Indiana State Fair should enforce whatever morals clause—and I would presume such a clause exists in the standard contract for lease of space at YOUR Indiana State Fair—in the exhibitors’ leases or contracts and ask that any paraphernalia of the Confederacy be removed is one that seems timely.<br/>   As for the food served at the fair, I can get corn on the cob at the market on College. And I have not been a fan of deep-fried candy or cookies.      <br/><br/> </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   Steve Rowe was a bailiff at Marion Superior Court-Juvenile Division when our paths first crossed in about 1989. We struck up a conversation.  A couple of days later I ran into him and his girlfriend at The (old pre-Harley) Stone Mug. They lived close by in Broad Ripple, only a couple of blocks away from me.<br/>   We cooked out a lot. Together, after much trial and error, we developed the World’s Best rib sauce. I do not know how many times we made babybacks together. I cannot remember the last time we did that, either. <br/>   We staged a slot car race—The Jigger Sirois 500.  Two teams raced.  By then, Steve was a Marion County Reserve Deputy Sheriff.  He had a PBT (portable breath tester). One rule of the race was that a team could challenge another team’s “driver” (these were slot cars) to a PBT.  If the challenged person’s blood alcohol content was less than .08, that team’s car was black-flagged until the BAC was sufficient.<br/>   Steve visited me when I was in the hospital for nine (9) days in 1994. The diagnosis was MS. He wore the new uniform he had been issued after graduation from the academy. A few years later, when I walked my first Mini, Steve worked the course. He said if I had any problems to tell a race official to page Lieutenant Rowe. <br/>   Steve met Shannon and they were close, and Shannon is a sweetheart. Shannon moved out of state, though. <br/>   Steve met Kelley. As a judge appointed for that day, I officiated over Steve’s and Kelley’s wedding. Steve and Kelley bought horses. They raised kids in some kind of foster-grandparent thing I never understood.  Sometimes people change, and so do relationships. A point came at which Steve and Kelley were not married.  <br/>   The past few months of my personal life have been tumultuous. Steve was there to help if anything was needed. One day to boost my spirits, Steve kidnaped me from my office and took me to a cigar bar he had discovered in Brownsburg. On my birthday, Steve met up with me at Flatwater’s. I told him good news I had received that morning—I might not have MS. We went from Flatwater’s to The Village Cigar.<br/>   A couple of weeks ago I threw the first party I have thrown since December 18. Some people played euchre. I fired up the grill. I had burgers and, in my invitation, told people to bring whatever they wanted to eat or drink. Steve brought shish-ka-bobs of some sort, and some devilish sort of pudding pop infused with alcohol. He said he had taken up trombone again, the instrument he played in high school.<br/>   When he left we promised we would get together soon.<br/>   Last night I received a telephone call and was told Steve had passed away. He was seated at his kitchen table. Initial indications are he had a heart attack.<br/>   Steve Rowe was my best friend over the past nearly thirty years. I took for granted he would be there—as a person with whom to smoke a cigar, drink a beer, or cook out some ribs. His politics were different from mine, but that did not matter. He was a good man and will be missed.<br/>   I am numb from his having passed. We should have had ribs July 5 at that party.    <br/> </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   In the wake of the mass shooting in the Charleston, South Carolina church Wednesday evening, several commentators have expressed concern that Indiana has no “hate crime” among its statutes. As noted on Wikipedia (my 1996 pocket edition of Black’s Law Dictionary lacks a definition of “hate crime”): “Hate crime laws protect against hate crimes (also known as bias crimes) motivated by enmity or animus against a protected class. Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person’s protected characteristics of race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.”<br/>   I am opposed to enactment of so-called “hate crimes” for several reasons:<br/>   1) The statute on the books punishes sufficiently. When Matt Shepard, a gay man, was beaten to death in Wyoming, generally people were outraged. His assailants were prosecuted for murder and received consecutive Life Sentences without the possibility of parole (also known as LWOP). James Byrd, Jr., an African-American man, was murdered in Texas, in the course of which he was chained to and dragged behind a truck. His assailants received two death penalty sentences and one LWOP.  Neither of these cases was prosecuted under a hate crime.  Murder is murder. Extreme violent crimes are what they are—and generally carry heavy punishment. As NYU Law School Professor, and Director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice, James B. Jacobs, wrote in 1993: “The horrendous crimes that provide the imagery and emotion for the passage of hate-crime legislation are already so heavily punished under American law that any talk of ‘sentence enhancement’ must be primarily symbolic.” <br/>   2) To label an act a “hate crime” adds another element to prosecute. To convict a person of a crime in this country, the State (or Commonwealth) must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to all elements. If one adds an element, the prosecution becomes more difficult. In Matt Shepard’s case there was dispute over whether the murderers acted because he was gay. If the goal of enactment of such legislation is to prosecute persons who perpetrate such offenses more thoroughly, to make the prosecutor’s job more difficult makes little sense.<br/>   3) In Indiana, the matter of a hate crime can be considered as an aggravator for sentence. When a person is sentenced, the judge can considered factors in aggravation and factors in mitigation of the statutory advisory sentence on the books for an offense. Aggravators are within the discretion of the judge. The prosecutor can argue for aggravators. An “aggravator” is not a sentence “enhancement.” An aggravator is used to determine sentence within the range of penalties provided by a specific statute. An enhancement raises the sentence above the range of penalties.  <br/>   4) There is no evidence enactment of hate crime statutes deters behavior. In their October 2, 2013, article in The Nation, “Hate Crime Laws Don’t Deter Violence Against LGBT People,” Michael Bronski, Ann Pellegrini and Michael Amico note that studies do not establish hate crimes have any deterrent value. <br/>   5) The roots of hate crimes run much deeper and call for more comprehensive solutions. Kay Whitlock is the National Representative for LGBT issues for the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC).  The AFSC is a Quaker organization that works for peace and demilitarization, human rights, social justice, and human rights in the United States and throughout the World.  In her essay “Reconsidering Hate: Policy and Politics at the Intersection,” she is paraphrased by Bronski, et al. I quote their summary because her essay, available on the internet, is quite comprehensive and worth the time to read—and their summary is fair. Whitlock “argues that the simple framework of ‘hate’ to describe and punish violence is completely inadequate to describe and punish the deeper divisions and schisms in our culture that are the root of the problem.  Arresting people, often young people, and placing them, for long periods of time, in prisons that make no attempt at rehabilitation and will undoubtedly subject them to the endemic violence of prisons, are part of the problem, not the solution.  Whitlock suggests that the only way we, as a country and a political system, can move beyond a culture of violence is to work from the bottom up, not the top down.  We need to address violence and hatred on the most basic interpersonal levels and at the level of small communities. Working within communities, schools, neighborhoods and organizations to examine the racial, economic and psychological reasons that are often underpinning these crimes will move us beyond the simplistic rhetoric of an ambiguously defined ‘hate.’”<br/>   Politicians get votes when they sound aggressive on aspects of crime. When they have to face the more difficult job of actual work on the root causes of crime, they seem to take a pass.<br/>   Indiana has no statutes titled “hate crimes.” We should keep statistics on occurrences, but to address the underlying problems. If one person murders another, the crime is the same. Those factors should be considered after the person is tried and found guilty, and sentence is imposed.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   On Wednesday, another mass shooting took place in the United States.<br/>   Before the gun nuts get revved up, this blog will not address the absurd proliferation (oddly, “prolife” is the first part of the word “proliferation”) of assault weapons, etc., in this country. Instead, I want to address another aspect of the incident.<br/>   An individual identified as a forensic psychiatrist appeared on The Charlie Brooker Show after a school shooting in Winenden, Germany, in March, 2009. In that shooting, 17-year-old Tim Kretschmer killed 16 people (mostly students) before he committed suicide.<br/>   Germany has been characterized as having some of the strictest gun control laws in the World. So all you gun nuts out there—yes, those laws apparently failed to stop Kretschmer from laying his hands on firearms and killing. However—this is a big however—overall Germany, in 2012, had 819 total fatalities from guns. The number includes accidental deaths and suicides. The rate of gun deaths per 100,000, population was 1.24. That same year the United States saw 33,636, deaths by firearms. Our rate was 10.64 deaths per hundred thousand.<br/>   The forensic psychiatrist—whose name was not given on the clip someone replayed from 2009 coverage of the Germany shooting—focused on how to prevent these types of mass shootings.<br/>   Think about CNN, MSNBC, Fox—and their minute-by-minute coverage of such shootings. People who are unbalanced might tend to look up to the shooters.<br/>   Here are the suggestions the forensic psychiatrist made to the media as one way to lessen the occurrence of mass shootings:<br/>    1) Do not start the story with the blare of sirens.<br/>    Maybe the sirens almost are fanfare for would-be killers.<br/>    2) Do not show photographs of the killer.<br/>    One commentator said, especially as to repeated displays of a killer’s photograph, this makes the person into a nihilistic pinup boy.<br/>    3) Do not make coverage of the shooting 24/7.<br/>    The coverage is standard now, complete with animated, imagined re-enactments and “live” remotes of reporters standing outside a government building advising what they think might be announced at a nes conference that might take place.<br/>    4) Do everything to avoid body count as the lead of the story.<br/>    Maybe some people walk around and think: “They’ll really pay attention to me if I can kill X-number of people and beat that record from Virginia Tech!” <br/>    5) Do not make the killer some sort of anti-hero.<br/>    Maybe Charlie Starkweather started this trend a few decades ago. The kids—and some of them are kids—who end up as killers have problems. They look up to people who would shock the crap out of others. <br/>    6) Localize the story to the affected community—but to the rest of the markets make it as boring as possible.<br/>   The last point, all the points, really, if made mandatory, is something that runs counter to our notion of freedom of the press.  If we don’t know what’s going on, how can we stop it?<br/>   Maybe we should let ratings deter broadcasters from the way in which mass shootings are covered. Unfortunately, there is a certain bloodlust in the United States. If executions were carried out on TV, that show probably would be Number One in its time slot—for a while. The American people grow easily bored. One season’s hit is on the next season’s list of shows canceled. I think people were opposed to the Vietnam War, after a certain point, say 1970, not so much because of the war itself, but because people were bored with all the coverage.<br/>   The suggestions made by the forensic psychiatrist—and please let me know if someone finds out who the guy is or was; if he’s now disgraced or, himself, went on a shooting rampage, I know I’ll get an ear-ful—are suggestions. Paddy Chayevsky’s “Network,” some 40 years ago, predicted the entertainment division would take over the news division. <br/>   Coverage of mass shootings should not be entertainment. <br/>      <br/><br/></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

I live in a big city and, therefore, with Indy’s cutbacks on safety, I was apprehensive. I saw a short man, oddly dressed in the fashion of the early Twentieth Century. He looked familiar. In one hand he held an umbrella. In the other hand he held an unlit cigar. He rapped again at the door, with the handle (now I saw) of the umbrella. I asked him what he wanted. He muttered several phrases in German. Given his style of dress, his neat appearance complete with trimmed beard, and his insistent attitude, I invited him into my house.<br/>   He was impatient and tapped his umbrella against the frame of the door. Again he uttered phrases highly reminiscent of the sayings of Sergeant Schultz of “Hogan’s Heroes.” There were wisps of cloud about him.<br/>   Hand extended, I introduced myself. He replied—as if I should know—he was Doctor Sigmund Freud.     <br/>   “Don’t you mean Sigmund Frood?” I asked, with an attempt at humor, and offered hm a chair.<br/>   He went to English. “Ever since that movie I have had to deal with mispronunciation of my name.” He seemed disgusted.<br/>   “To what do I owe the honor of this visit?” I asked.<br/>   “I monitor goings-on in newspapers, and other media. I saw an item on a blog today, ‘Ogden on Politics’ carried a column from some daily newspaper that criticized the Gay Pride Festival parade and the Mayor of your city for acting as Grand Marshal. Their concern for children was valid.” I pointed out Ogden only had reprinted the Heck column with a few observations before and after. “Ogden does that quite a bit,” Freud agreed, “but he gets away with it—and has more unique views on his website than you have on yours.”<br/>   I was perplexed. “You died, right?” He nodded, again impatiently. “You exist in an afterlife?”<br/>   “The concept is vague in Jewish texts. Emphasis is on the life one leads on Earth.”<br/>   “So there is no heaven, exactly? There is no hell?”<br/>    “I am not sure. I only know I am in Cleveland, it would appear.” He added, “And after every Browns’ season—and the Clippers beating Lebron...” He shook his head as his voice faded. He looked up at me, then glanced to the side. “You have a humidor? By chance may I smoke one of your cigars?” <br/>   “I would prefer that you didn’t. I want to return to bed. If you smoke a cigar I would insist on smoking one, too. I smoke a Churchill and that’s a good 90 minutes to smoke.”<br/>   “May I at least have one to smell?”<br/>   The request might sound disgusting, but this was the Father of Psychoanalysis and I said “sure.” I pulled a cigar of one of my less favorite brands out and set it on the table next to him. He thanked me, picked up the cigar, and sniffed at it, rather obscenely, before he placed it between his lips.<br/>   “Let’s return to why you have decided to visit me,” I suggested.<br/>   “The sexual degeneracy as described by Ogden and this Mr. Heck was shocking. The Mayor passed ‘nearly naked men’ who ‘performed pelvic thrusts and simulated sex acts.’And also there were men ‘in dog collars and leather G-strings.’ I knew Catholic priests were sick, but never did I anticipate they would sexually express themselves publicly.” I explained the term “dog collar” was not a euphemism for the starched white collar worn by priests but, well, dog collars. “Oh?” He pondered this bit. “Oh! Mein gott in Himmel!”<br/>   “A great many of your writings,” I pointed out, “were about sexuality and repressed sexual expression. And I remember one artist wrote a line in a song that paraphrased you: ‘A thing’s a phallic symbol if it’s longer than it’s wide.’”<br/>   “Please spare me that! I’ve had to deal with that for years. ‘Artist’? That was Melanie! She didn’t even perform at the real Woodstock but Woodstock II!”<br/>   “You writings suggest phallic implications to many things,” I said and indicated the cigar stuck between his dead lips.<br/>   “A cigar is only a cigar!” he insisted testily. “I also can be quoted as saying that!” He returned to the subject of the Ogden blog and the column by Mr. Heck.  “What was described here was awful! Men dressed as women or not dressed at all! And the pelvic thrusts!”<br/>   “Have you ever watched an NFL game?”<br/>   “Unfortunately,” he said. “That’s difficult to avoid in Cleveland.” He shook his head. <br/>   “Women—cheerleaders on the sidelines—are scantily-clad. Pelvic thrusts have been performed in pre-game and half-timer shows a great many times at NFL games. Sex—in the form of near-naked women—is used to sell almost anything in commercial advertising.”<br/>   “I know,” he said. “Bill Hicks made that point rather clearly. But the drive for women is natural as part of our inner beings.”<br/>   ”How about the drive of women for women?” I asked, as an extension of his premise.<br/>   He nodded, and smiled dreamily. “I have written several essays, since my death, on the subject of women with women. The concept is quite—interesting.”<br/>   “What about men with men?” I asked.<br/>   Freud was brought back to the moment. “That is sick! The only thing one man should put into another is a bullet!”<br/>   “You stole that line from Bill Maher!” I said accusingly. He grunted. “Face it—open expressions of sexuality are commonplace in the 21st Century. American society approves of near-nudity—of women—at the Oscars and the Grammys and whatever other awards are out there. Women are objectified. Yet when in the Pride festival people express themselves, and the expression is by males, females, transexuals...”<br/>   “Transexuals are interesting,” he conceded. “I wrote that men and women possess the same hormones, but in different proportions.” <br/>   “The concern expressed for children,” I continued,”is interesting. You saw this on the internet. Have you surfed much on the internet?” He avoided eye contact with me. “I daresay children see more on the internet in less tasteful contexts than they might have seen in the Pride parade downtown.”<br/>   He pulled out a pocket watch. He stood up. “I really must go.”<br/>   “Why?”<br/>   “You make no sense. Besides, the Cubs are playing the Cleveland Indians.”<br/>   “That game’s over. The Cubs won 17-0.”<br/>   Freud shook his head. “Matters will really be ugly in Cleveland. The game, though, is not my concern.”<br/>   “What is your concern?”<br/>   “They have, in Cleveland, what are called ‘gentlemen’s clubs’ and I want to watch some of the women, er, perform there.”<br/>   “You mean you[‘re going to a strip club.”<br/>   He shrugged and headed toward the door. “Call it what you will.” He held up his cigar. “And a cigar is just a cigar!”<br/>   With that last statement he was gone, wisps following him out the door.<br/>       <br/>   </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>  On this 43rd anniversary of the Watergate break-in, I thought of politics and irony.<br/>   President Nixon was on his way to a landslide re-election victory in 1972, in part because of such tactics as exemplified by the Watergate fiasco, but also because Nixon had made a lot of what today would be called progressive moves (like creating the EPA) although simultaneously prolonging direct United States military involvement in Vietnam so he could make a grandstand peace deal as the 1972 election campaign came to a close.<br/>   Yesterday, Donald Trump annunced his candidacy for President of the United States—and took the stage to the tune of Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World.”<br/>   As someone pointed out, that probably was not a good song for Trump to choose.<br/>   Young’s song is about how then-President George H.W. Bush’s minions do not care about the poor and the disadvantaged. Neil issued a statement, through his publicist, that the Donald lacked Young’s permission to use his song. Young, by the way, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for President. Also, the video for the tune portrays images rather counter to Trump’s lifestyle and beliefs.<br/>   John Mellencamp had a similar experience with one of his songs and ohn McCain’s (2008), and Scott Walker’s campaign most recently for using “Small Town.”  Other rock artists have taken umbrage with Republican candidates for use of the rockers’ works to promote campaigns the philosophies of which are counter to those artists’ beliefs.<br/>   There is one solution (besides to obey the law and respect copyrighted work)—Republicans can use all the Ted Nugent hits they want. I am confident Nugent would be happy to oblige. The campaigns can advance various rallies by cuing up and playing the tunes of—all one-and-a-half hits?<br/>   And tonight, celebrate Watergate, the duct tape that was wrapped the wrong away across the lock of the door to Larry O’Brien’s office so guards could see it, and “The Sounds of Silence”—the 18 ½ minutes of blank tape on President Nixon’s tape system.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   The contract Mayor Ballard entered into a contract with Vision Fleet has garnered attention from the media of communications and news coverage that seem most comprehensive in our local political goings-on these days: the local blogosphere. <br/>   As I understand the numbers, the City would pay $35 million for 400 French-manufactured electric vehicles. Photos I have seen of the vehicles purportedly to be provided by the terms of the lease show tiny cars. I was reminded of the original Honda automobiles introduced before the first Civic model. <br/>   I did some research. I visited the local Tesla store at The Fashion Mall. There’s nothing quite like visiting a place owned by billionaires and subsidized by taxpayers to visit a store for luxury vehicles.<br/>   The Tesla four-door Model S I test-drove was more spacious than the 2002 Camry I have driven for over 150,000, miles.  The Model S was about as spacious as I recall one of my old man’s mid-1970s Buick Electra Limiteds as being.<br/>   The Model S has a lot of pick-up, as in zero-to-sixty in five seconds flat. A Corvette does zero-to-sixty in 4.8 seconds.  <br/>   The range of the Model S I tested was about 240 miles. The price tag was $70,000.00. There is a tax credit for $7,500 that goes along with the purchase.<br/>   If the City bought—not leased but bought—a fleet of 400 Tesla Model S cars, the price tag would be $28 million at full retail. Two points should be made on the figure: 1) Competent purchase agents for a metropolitan entity probably could negotiate a better price for such a big purchase of vehicles, so if this were to be done, we would have to wait until Mayor Ballard leaves office; and 2) There are models with longer range, and batteries can be swapped out in 90 seconds, so there would be no concern for emergency vehicles, such as police cars.<br/>   Other nice aspects of the Tesla purchase are: 1) The City would own the vehicles, and they have a 90%-plus resale value; 2) Teslas, from what I have read, are manufactured in the United States; and 3) The vehicles are incredibly efficient.<br/>   Maybe the City even could build a wind farm to generate electricity for the fleet of Teslas.<br/>   If we need vehicles on the scale stated by Mayor Ballard, we should buy, not lease. If we buy, we should buy American-manufactured vehicles.

<p>   A colleague called me yesterday morning to say The Indiana Law Blog had an item about the picture of a roller coaster having been superimposed on the video of oral argument in Whistle Stop Inn, et al v. City of Indianapolis in which I argued for Appellants/Plaintiffs Monday afternoon.<br/>   First, I was concerned someone might believe I had something to do with the matter. There would be little point to illustrating an oral argument with a graphic the judges could not see. Also, without having researched the matter, I feel confident when I say to have done so would violate some Federal or State statutes, or statutes of both.  Such conduct also would violate some provision of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Thus the conduct would be both wrong and stupid. I would point out, however, that my lack of techno-savvy for such matters can be gauged by my inability to “link” either the ILB items or the oral argument in question to this blog. I never was able to repair the 8-track tape deck I received for a high school graduation present in 1973. The deck fried out on Black Sabbath’s “Master of Reality” album, purchased, as I recall, at Tuchman Cleaners when that merchant marketed 8-track tapes for a dollar each. <br/>   My initial concern was put to rest about the roller coaster later on Wednesday. Martin DeAgostino, Communications Director for the Indiana Court of Appeals, was quoted by The Indiana Law Blog to say the system had not been “hacked”: “The image you’re asking about is a stock image that is preloaded into our recording system. The image inadvertently appeared during the webcast when the system operator made a stray keystroke. It in no way involves any question of system integrity or ‘hacked’ access to the webcast or the Court’s webcasting system.”<br/>   Concerns now alleviated, I pondered the roller coaster image as a metaphor for oral argument.<br/>   Magnum, at Cedar Point, when I visited the park and rode the ride, was billed as the world’s tallest, fastest roller coaster. One morning, before the park opened, I watched, from the back of the hotel in which I stayed, as employees rode the coaster in preparation for the day’s customers. The cars would inch toward the top of the first hill. I could hear the “clink-clink-clink” of whatever mechanism pulled the cars to the summit. At a point at which the first three cars had crested the hill, the mechanism released, gravity took control, and the coaster flew down on its run.<br/>    After the park opened, we stood inline for 45 minutes to ride Magnum. <br/>   The wait was a bit unnerving. There were screams from the riders of Magnum, but also from other rides. Anxiety was understandable. I had thought through how I would react on the thing. One overriding concern was not to puke. <br/>   When finally our turn came, and we were strapped or whatever into our seats, the cars began to move. The first “hill” of the ride was the tallest and steepest. I looked down at Lake Erie and at other of the park’s customers, as everything down there grew smaller.<br/>   As we neared the top of the hill, I listened to the “clink-clink-clink” of the mechanism that hauled us up the hill. From the sixth or seventh car back, I watched as the first, second, and third cars crested, and went over the summit. There was a pause as the thing was released. We hurtled down the hill and through the course. One flashes on concepts of mortality in some moments. The ride was short. I did not puke. My eyes even were open as the cars shot down the first hill. <br/>   Oral argument is similar to a roller coaster ride. If there is some great karmic cluster of chips in the Central Processing Unit of the mainframe that runs all mainframes, that would have been an alternative explanation for someone having hit the wrong keystroke. <br/>   Many people have not seen an appellate argument. I would encourage everyone to go to the website of the Indiana Supreme Court and the Indiana Court of Appeals and watch one.<br/>   The wait for the judges or justices (whether the case is before the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court) to take their seats at the bench is somewhat anxiety-laden. The doors to the chambers are closed. There is no “clink-clink-clink” as we begin to climb the first hill, but I swear I can hear the clock on the wall.<br/>   The justices or judges (I want to make sure I flip that; the Supreme Court is the higher court and so, I want to mention its members first) enter from behind the bench as the bailiff bangs the gavel and announces the Court is in session. Some courts have much more archaic ways of announcing court is in session. Any way it is done, the effect is the same—the cars have crested the hill, the mechanism has been released, and the gravity of argument takes hold. <br/>   Lawyers in oral argument do not read from scripts. We do not argue with each other. Instead, we answer questions from the judges or justices. Every bench before which I have argued in Indiana has been a “hot” bench. Usually, after I say, “May it please the Court,” the name or names of the party or parties I represent, and the relief we seek, the questions start. Sometimes the time at the lectern seems much longer than one had thought 15 minutes or whatever could be. Other times, time seems to fly.<br/>   There are two things I write at the top of my legal pad for each oral argument: “LISTEN” and “SLOW DOWN.” The first is because good oral advocacy involves listening to the questions of members of the court AND ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. To listen to the questions is (I reasonably believe) the best way to accomplish that task. The second is because I was a debater in college. My first couple of years, we “spread.” In other words, we would talk as fast as possible (200 to 225 words per minute I believe one journal article noted) to get as many arguments into the record as possible as that would make refutation by the other team more difficult. Speech at such velocity does not bode well for rational understanding. So I endeavor to SLOW DOWN.<br/>   Debate was good preparation for oral advocacy. Better training, however, was two years of standup comedy in Chicago. I stood in front of a room of people, half of whom were drunk, who had paid good money to have me (and other comics on the card) make them laugh. And half the people who were drunk thought they were funnier than the people on the stage. (In some instances those members of the audience were correct.) That’s a tough room to play. An appellate court also is a tough room to play. Unlike comedy clubs, where hecklers can be tossed out, in appellate courts, the judges will continue to hit one with tough questions. One feels concern for one’s own mortality.<br/>   The questions go to opposing counsel in similar fashion. Then there is time for rebuttal.<br/>   After several minutes the ride is over. One still is alive. <br/>   Someone hit the wrong keystroke in Monday’s oral argument. If the image had been of something else, the metaphor might not have been as apt. There even could have been an excerpt of the greatest movie of all time, “Plan Nine from Outer Space” by Edd Wood. I do not know that I could have blogged about that.  <br/>   One final point I need to make about the video system of our Indiana Supreme Court. I watch all my oral arguments to spot the things on which I need to improve. However, there is a glitch in one of the cameras in the Indiana Supreme Court chamber. The camera from behind the lectern is defective. The image it shows of me shows a bald spot on the back of my head. I never have seen a bald spot on the back of my head. When I mention this to friends, they chuckle and say the camera has it right. I indeed have a bald spot on the back of my head.<br/>  I do not have a bald spot on the back of my head.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   Broad Ripple—“maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of our lives”—will become a “brand.” In the presentation a couple of years ago about the Whole Foods complex planned for the Village—because, as one presenter noted (to a chorus of boos from the audience that consisted of many customers and fans of longtime locally-owned and operated organic food store Good Earth) Broad Ripple lacks an organic food store—one of the “suits” on the stage of the Broad Ripple Methodist Church said the group from the Broad Ripple Village Association had tried to find a symbol or icon for The Village.<br/>   Broad Ripple might as well become a brand—a corporate symbol to market whatever the pay-to-play people want to sell. Broad Ripple and Fountain Square seem to be little satellite areas to which visitors—for conventions, sports events, etc.—to the Circle City can go when those visitors become bored with the downtown area (built up by hundreds of millions of dollars in TIF funds).<br/>   I remember a couple of visits I made to Broad Ripple shortly after I graduated from DePauw. I hit The Patio and enjoyed the music. A few years later, I was in Caesar’s the night John Belushi died. Caesar’s became The Stone Mug. Somehow I always ended up either at The Alley Cat or—and I did not know where it was, I would end up there somehow—Connor’s.<br/>   As my second year of law school commenced, I moved from downtown to Broad Ripple and Jade North Apartments. Those apartments, on North College, were occupied by a lot of senior citizens. The place was convenient. After class or after work, I would park my ‘Vette—a 1983 Chevette, one of the worst-engineered vehicles ever—and trundle next door to The Mug, or down to Broad Ripple Avenue to Mickey Quinn’s or for dinner at El Matador. Johnny Whitaker’s was in what is now the downstairs of 10-01. Union Jack’s was where it is now.<br/>   If one were adventurous, one could grab a cab to The Pawn Shop—the old Pawn Shop, at College and Kessler—or The Bull Dog, further south on College. Dinner could be at Schaeffer’s, with their fondu.<br/>   Next morning, one could have breakfast at Fox Deli.<br/>   There were cultural aspects to Broad Ripple other than the bars and places for food. There was a used bookstore in a house on Ferguson and Walden Books—okay, part of a national chain—was next to Peaches record store on Broad Ripple Avenue. Big Hat was here for a while, but did not last. I guess the reading public in Broad Ripple prefers to drive all the way to Barnes &amp; Noble at Keystone at the Crossing.<br/>   When I moved to Broad Ripple, in 1987, my old man would drive down occasionally from near Kokomo to have Sunday dinner. The place to which we always went was MCL Cafeteria.<br/>   MCL had good food. MCL’s fried chicken was great. The mashed potatoes were awesome. The desserts were excellent. The folks were worked there all were local and had personalities. Some worked there for at least ten years or more. MCL also is a chain, but with main offices a couple of blocks east, on the other side of Keystone Avenue where Broad Ripple Avenue becomes 62nd Street. <br/>   Once I was out of law school, and my office was here in Ripple, I often had lunch at MCL. Sometimes I had dinner there, or would pick up to take home.<br/>   So I was shocked yesterday when Judy, who usually works entrees but has operated the cash register from time-to-time, informed me MCL will close that location. The last day is this Sunday, May 17. An assistant manager said the landlord refused to make repairs to bring the building up to code, and so MCL no longer could operate. The lease expired. After Sunday, one of the last local places will leave.<br/>   I am confident the owner or owners of the building in which MCL has been located for at least three decades has a plan for the place. Other, smaller businesses are in the building—a nail spa, a clothes alteration place, and a Pak-Mail—and probably will have little difficulty if they have to re-locate. Somehow I think the vacant building behind MCL fits like a glove on a greedy hand with a vacant building in which MCL has been. The great seers who came up with their “vision” for Broad Ripple will pose, in line, to scoop, with ceremonial silver shovels, the first dirt for clearance and construction of—what? Will we see another box-like apartment structure? <br/>   Corporate American wants every bar to be like Applebee’s®. Pay-to-play folks want to fund everything with TIFs, originally created for areas of impacted poverty, but now used for general development and subsidization of investments of interests already with money.  And those TIFs financially cripple the communities in which TIFs are deployed. TIFs were developed in the 1950s in California. As a funding concept TIFs were so successful, California now bans TIFs. <br/>   I shall miss MCL. I shall miss the fried chicken and mashed potatoes. I even had begun to like the spinach and asparagus. I can drive to the MCL on 86th Street---but for lunch? <br/>   And maybe the landlord will make those changes and not tear the place down. A bookstore will go in there. A different cafeteria will occupy the space where MCL has been for decades. Sure. That will be about the time Mayor Greg Ballard admits he was wrong—about anything—and Indianapolis stops funding billionaire sports owners over schools, police and streets.   <br/> </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

The boat was 70 feet or so long. The fixtures were clean and polished. The members of the crew were polite.<br/>   We left the dock. The Hancock Building rose above us. I engaged in conversation with a very witty woman. The sun shone off her long, red hair. We were served dinner of blackened Mahi Mahi (that, remarkably, nearly was identical in ingredients, taste, texture, and presentation as that served at Flatwater’s in Broad Ripple). Too soon the cruise was over.<br/>   I awoke at about 4 a.m., a half-hour before the usual time at which I start my day.<br/>   The little trip—it well could have been a three-hour tour—left a smile on my face. <br/>   I have not taken a vacation—see the definition above—since 2008.  Trips for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) do not qualify as vacations. Trips connected, even in part, with someone’s business, likewise, are not vacations.<br/>   In sleep my mind found a way to get out of town for a while. <br/>   I should have known I was in a dream when I looked up at the Hancock Building from the boat. Hancock (I passed it each day on my way to work at Northwestern University School of Law (shelving books in the library) from 1982 to 1983 is next to neither the Chicago River nor Lake Michigan. One can see Hancock in the skyline from the lake. In the dream the boat on which I was a passenger was at the base of the building. “Hancock Building dreams” have a certain quality for me. <br/>    I recommend people get away from work, if only for brief respites, on occasion.

<p>   There are periods in which person experiences self-doubt. Self-doubt can lead to loss of  “confidence”—“full trust; belief in the trustworthiness or reliability of a person.” The American College Dictionary, 1962 ed. Three people had to help me the last three-quarters of a mile to finish yesterday’s race. They gave me confidence.<br/>   Yesterday I was determined to finish the Mini. My goal in my first Indianapolis 500 Festival Mini-Marathon®), in 1999, was to break three hours for the 13.1 mile course. As I wrote yesterday, I walk the Mini with the attitude I would flip “the bird,” metaphorically, to the Multiple Sclerosis from which I lost use of my legs and with which I was diagnosed in 1994. I began to walk in the mornings before work. To “do” the Mini seemed a goal reasonably related to what I had experienced. If I could walk again, and 13.1 miles at that, I would post a victory over MS. When I finished the Race, I swore to myself I would not miss a Mini.<br/>   My first seven or eight Minis, I finished in under three hours. My best time was in 2002 at 2:42:13, a fairly quick pace for a walk. I was in shape from having trained and walked the full marathon, the previous October, at Fort Ben. <br/>   I began to slow down. I had lost cartilage in my left knee. The walk hurt. I was bummed out, but took the loss of velocity in stride, so to say. I trained less. I had done the Race so many times, I figured I could do it okay.<br/>   In 2012 I had to pull over after mile 10 and take the bus. The folks who worked the Race and the people on the bus, were great. In 2013, I gritted my teeth and finished. Last year I had to pull over just after mile 9. My knee was extremely sore.<br/>   This year I trained hardly at all. Knee pain had been the reason I had to take the bus to the finish line those two years. I had no doubt my stamina. <br/>   A very good friend, Amy Kelley, picked me up at 7 and we went downtown. She dropped me off and I found my way to my area for the start. I felt great. I could finish this Race.<br/>   I had an equipment malfunction. My cassette player crapped out. I had to listen to a radio station instead of my own selection of music—a minor inconvenience.<br/>   In 2002, I walked the first mile in 10:30. Yesterday I covered it in 17:35. The pace quickened to about 16:30 for the next four miles. That was cool. I felt okay. The knee let me know when I had to take Aleve. The roll of my feet helped, but did not eliminate the pain.<br/>   The weather was another matter. The day was downright hot for me, especially at the track. The Panama hat I wear each year provides good cover, but the sun was too bright. The track is brutal under those conditions. There is no shade. Any breeze is cut by the grandstands. The asphalt radiates warmth. One’s eyeballs begin to feel warm. I thought I never would have the opportunity to once more sit down.<br/>   At mile 9 I told myself I could make it—only look to finish the next mile. At mile 10 I remembered when I pulled over in 2012. I was a bit light-headed by that point yesterday. I moved on and looked for the mile 11 signs. After I passed them, I called Amy and said she should drive downtown to the place at which we agreed she would pick me up. <br/>   I began to stagger a little. Some of the people who passed me asked if I was okay. I nodded. I was not able to talk easily. I had to save my energy. <br/>   I passed the mile 12 marker and turned onto the New York Street bridge. The bridge is uphill and crests at its half-way point. I inferred the man I heard encouraging people was doing so for people with whom he was doing the Mini. He got up even with me.<br/>   “Hey,” I said. He looked over and asked how I was doing. I asked, “May I use your shoulder?” He did not hesitate and said “sure.” I put my left arm around his shoulders, and he did the same with me. His name is Michael. He is a police officer in Indy. I told him my name and explained I had been silly not to train for this, my seventeenth. “Really?” I said yeah, my first was in 1999. “So was mine.”<br/>   We walked that way for about a quarter-mile. Two men came up from behind us and asked if we needed held. Michael said no, we were doing okay. I thanked the guys and said, “Michael here has had enough extra weight for a while. Yeah, I can use some help.”<br/>   I thanked Michael and told him I would not have been able to make it but for his help. He said, “But you made it the first 12 miles.” I agreed, but said the last mile would have been impossible without his help and wished him a good “rest of the Race.”<br/>   David and Kurt (or Kirk or Curt; I was a little whoozy by then) were on each side of me and I had an arm around the should of each. They were rescue workers of some sort. We talked as we made our way toward the finish line. About a hundred yards before the finish line, I said I could make it the rest of the way. I thanked them, and said the same thing I had said a few minutes earlier to Michael: without their help I could not have made it. Their reply was the same as Michael’s. “You made the first 12 miles.” My response was a reprise of what I had said to Michael. <br/>   I made it across the finish line, received my medal, and walked a couple more blocks, where Amy awaited in the cosmic rescue vehicle.        <br/>   For those of you who went downtown to see a loved one off at the start of the Mini, the day could not have been more beautiful. For people in the Race—especially those of us who are slower and started later; or, at least, for me—the weather was bad. I got home, took a long pull on a jug of water in the refrigerator, flopped onto my bed, let one of the cats—Little Bit—curl up next to me, and passed out for 90 minutes. I woke up refreshed. <br/>   I ignored some of the advice I gave yesterday: “If you feel like you might be about to feel bad—pull over. If Mario and Michael slowed down at the 500, you can, too. A ride on a golf cart to the nurses’ station is better than heat stroke. And those folks are there to help you.”<br/>   I apologized (or think I apologized) to Michael and David and Kurt) for having not trained. For next year’s Mini I shall train. I will buy a used treadmill (anyone know of one on the market?). My goal, once again, is to break three hours. (My official time yesterday was 4:54:01.)<br/>   I wrote about “confidence” at the top of this blog for a reason. There is confidence one has in oneself. There also is confidence one gains from the realization that the people around us are good and will help. I should not have laid that onto the gentlemen who helped me finish the Mini. They were okay with it, but I should not have been so irresponsible as to necessitate their assistance. <br/>   So I would like to thank all of you who read the blog yesterday (and am grateful for your comments) and all who volunteered to work the Race. I tried to thank the folks as I walked past the Pit Areas where they pass out water and Gatorade®. Also, thanks go to the members of the National Guard, the Civil Air Patrol (at least I think those were the uniforms), the Marion County Sheriff’s Department, the IMPD and the State Police who were all along the route. I also thank the musicians and other entertainers.   <br/>   I would like to thank my friend Amy Kelley. (I promised I will buy dinner for her and her boyfriend Jim). I could not have driven myself back from the Race.<br/>   As much as anyone, I want to thank Michael and Kurt (or Curt or Kirk) and David. You renewed my confidence in several ways. You told me I had made the first 12 miles. Without your help, I could not have finished the Race. You let me understand people are good. Still, I’ll train for next Year’s Mini.</p>

<p>   Today I shall walk my seventeenth consecutive Indianapolis 500 Festival Mini-Marathon®. Two years ago, I blogged here about the reasons I walk the Mini.<br/>   In 1994, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. By the second day in the hospital, I completely had lost use of my legs. That evening—or maybe it was the next; things were a bit of a blur—a neurologist visited my room to inform me of the diagnosis. He said, “You have MS.” I was goofy on the drugs I had been administered—lawfully and by a licensed physician authorized to prescribe medications—and joked, “Wow—that’s cool.” The neurologist looked at me with an odd expression on his face. I said, “Not many people have a disease the acronym for which is their initials.” (Note: Jeff Cox correctly has pointed out to me, in a different matter, an acronym is a word formed by the first letters of whatever. He is right, but this is what I said.) The neurologist when on, a bit perplexed. He said something to the effect that the medical community knows little about MS (not true even then), but there are cerain demographics indicative of greater risk: including people with better educations are more likely to be diagnosed with “MS.” I said, “You mean like college? I knew the dorm food would come back to haunt me one day.” The neurologist left the room.<br/>   After nine days, I was released from the hospital, able to get around on crutches. <br/>   Multiple Sclerosis is—what? When I think of a “disease,” I think of an infection or other malady in which an outside pathogen gets into the body to cause illness. Multiple Sclerosis is different. As I understand it, I was genetically pre-disposed to a set of circumstances whereby I was susceptible to mononucleosis. (I had “mono” twice—shortly after I graduated from high school, and during second semester of my Freshman year in college.) “Mono” set my system into a condition that, two decades later, was susceptible, given stressors in my environment, to specific t-cells in my immune system attacking the myelin sheath of my central nervous system (or “CNS”). The myelin sheath (common simile I am about to use) is, to the CNS what insulation is to electrical wires. When the myelin sheath is seen as a foreign body by the t-cells and attacked during what is called an exacerbation (an “attack” of Multiple Sclerosis), parts of the body short out. Multiple Sclerosis hits people differently, given where, on the CNS the t-cells attack.<br/>   I was lucky. I was hit in an area of the spine that relays information to the lower body. (I also have a form of MS in which I only have had one exacerbation in the past 20 years.)  <br/>   I began to walk in the mornings, very early and before work. The pace quickened. Communications between my brain and my lower body improved. <br/>   Even before 1986, when I moved to Indianapolis, I knew about the Mini, and friends and acquaintances who used the Mini as a goal for various reasons, usually personal and specific to the person. As I walked during those mornings, in the months then years after my release from the hospital, I decided to go for it, and registered for the 1999 Mini. <br/>   As I walked down the slight slope on the bridge on New York Street and the last mile or so of the course that year, my eyes watered. My personal reason was to flip the bird at the thing called Multiple Sclerosis.   <br/>   Yesterday I picked up my race packet at the Convention Center. The 500 Festival organizers had put up a big sheet of poly-something on which people could write “why I run” or “why I walk” the Mini. One of the volunteers offered me a Sharpie® to write on the sheet. I walked up to it, found a spot near the bottom still open enough, sat cross-legged, and wrote something like: “I have MS/I could not walk/Now I can/This is my 17th consecutive Mini.–Mark Small.”<br/>   I teared up a little as I left the place.<br/>   Here are a few tips to folks who do their first Mini today: <br/>   Be careful of the folks around you. They might not know your pace or anticipate you are about to change your line.<br/>   If you feel like you might be about to feel bad—pull over. If Mario and Michael slowed down at the 500, you can, too. A ride on a golf cart to the nurses’ station is better than heat stroke. And those folks are there to help you.<br/>   Do not be confused about the weather. The air might seem cool, but asphalt heats up. Even a few degrees can have an effect. Try not to tarry so you get around the track as early and as quickly as you feasibly and safely can.<br/>   Don’t let anyone spray you with a hose to cool down. You don’t want water in your shoes that will cause your feet to blister.<br/>   I wish everyone the best today—and have a safe race. Even though I start in the Fifth wave and the letter “Y”—at one time I was a “K,” and, no, I am not a fan of the University of Kentucky—I still, technically, could go fast and win the whole thing.<br/>   Right. I am a fan of the Chicago Cubs National League Baseball Club. I can be a bit unrealistic.<br/>   If all goes as it has the past few years, I will finish in about three and a half hours. I shall hold up “17" in some form for the cameras as I cross the Yard of Bricks® at IMS. I shall get teary-eyed as I near the finish line.<br/>   Thanks to all the people who volunteer to make the Mini “go.” Thanks to all the volunteers who hand out water and Gatorade (and the folks with the little trays of shots of beer). <br/>   Thanks to all the bands and cloggers and other performers who do their thing to entertain along the course.<br/>   And a special thanks to all who have taken the time to read this blog today.<br/>   I now shall do my pre-Mini prep. I shall mow down some chocolate frosted donette gems, continue to hydrate, shower, dress, feed the cats, clean the litter boxes, and wait for a friend who said she will pick me up at 7:30 for a lift to the Start.<br/>   This is my seventeenth. Next year I shall do my eighteenth. <br/>    <br/> </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>    Kool-Aid® got a bad reputation in November, 1978, when Jim Jones (a Hoosier in case readers were unaware of the fact) exhorted (or threatened at gunpoint) his followers in Jonestown to drink from vats a brew of powdered soft drink flavoring agent laced with potassium cyanide. To accuse someone or group of people as having been drinking the Kool-Aid® has come to mean those people blindly follow a view or position despite catastrophic consequences. However, it is easier to accuse someone of having “drunk the Kool-Aid®” than to accuse the person of having “drunk a brew of powdered soft drink flavoring laced with potassium cyanide.”</p>
<p>   Lassitude gives forth quicky lines.</p>
<p>   In no way do I imply the Jonestown debacle was humorous. Over nine hundred people died there. As I recall, three alumni of my alma mater, DePauw University, had bought into Jones’s gig and hooked down refreshments. (Four alumni of DePauw’s rival, a school in Crawfordsville, were amongst those who perished, more both in total numbers and as a percentage of alumni than DePauw.)</p>
<p>   A fascination with beverages and leaders’ behavior has deep historical roots. President Abraham Lincoln is supposed to have said, when informed of Ulysses S. Grant’s proclivity for consumption of distilled spirits, “If I knew what he drinks, I’d buy every one of my generals a barrel.” The quote appears to be myth. Lincoln denied having said such a thing. Some 150 years later, variations of the quote remain with us.</p>
<p>   President Nixon’s War on Drugs—as ill-conceived a strategic concept as charges by mounted cavalry, in World War I, against machine gun emplacements—gave rise to the question, “What is he (or she) on?” The implication was a person’s otherwise rational thought processes had been disturbed by drugs. Of course, that was in the 1970s. How else could one explain Screaming Yellow Zonkers®, Pet Rocks®, or the rock group Uriah Heep than use of drugs? In the 1980s, the drug thing morphed into speculation as to whether the speaker was “on crack.” “Crack” gave way to meth. The difference between the two being bad dental hygiene. Now that meth is more cheaply manufactured in Mexico—the country, not the Miami County, Indiana, town—and the price of heroin has dropped precipitously, I suppose people will speculate as to what someone has “shot up.”</p>
<p>   Unfortunately, HIV cases have begun to rise. Scott County has garnered publicity from the spike—I guess that is a pun—in HIV numbers, attributed to people sharing needles to inject the product of the Papaver somniferum, also known as the opium poppy. In a surprisingly enlightened move, Governor Mike Pence issued an executive order to provide clean needles to persons in Scott County. That is a good first step. Other steps would include legalization of drugs, regulating sale of drugs through government-operated stores, release from prison of persons convicted solely on drug offenses, and expungement of those persons’ criminal records. I do not see those last things happening. Privatized penal systems derive profits from large numbers of people convicted of crimes. My bad—for which I apologize.   </p>
<p>   Someone might accuse me of having consumed a brew of powdered soft drink flavoring agent laced with potassium cyanide. I would rather have received a barrel of the booze ascribed to Lincoln. I would not have partaken of it. However, I would have sold it and purchased the domestic, bottled beer of which I am fond. We should forsake maligning otherwise benign beverages and state, instead, the reasons for our criticism of the person whose views we find in error. It’s just so much easier to say the person drank the Kool-Aid®, even though Kool-Aid® has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>   The truth of what is argued is lost behind a  metaphor the premises of which are flawed. And the point of a metaphor, I thought, was its accuracy to describe a situation. In otherwords, the metaphor is supposed to be accurate and thus truthful.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   Groundhogs were familiar visitors at my parents’s farm. When I told my father that a groundhog was in the mulberry tree next to the Upper Barn, he thought I was joking him. He saw for himself, however, that a specimen of Marmot monax, indeed, had burrowed into the main trunk of the dying tree, about ten feet above the ground.<br/>   Each year, a groundhog, with its home (I finally figured out) under the foundation of the silo on the east end of the Upper Barn, scampered to the nearby pear tree and picked the fruit before I could grab any. <br/>   My parents raised cattle and horses. If one of those creatures had hit a groundhog hole—and there were burrows in grazing areas and the possibility was real—the cow or horse would have had to have been “put down.” Thus groundhogs were dispatched by my old man or my male sibling—and, occasionally, by me—as soon as the groundhog revealed itself. I am not proud to say I hunted the creatures. I am familiar with Thoreau’s writing about groundhogs. His prose was poignant.<br/>   Unfortunately, groundhogs burrow.  Their burrows are problematic. A groundhog took up residence last summer under the deck on the back of my house. I do not own a firearm. The “old methods” of relocating (to a groundhog afterlife) of individual members of M. Monax, as employed on my parents’ farm, are unavailable. Even if I owned a firearm—and, emphatically, I would not—within the City limits use of a firearm, as I understand local ordinances, is prohibited. Even then, I would not use a gun because the population around here is far too dense with humans.<br/>   My questions to my readers are: <br/>   1) Does anyone know how to relocated a groundhog? I have left notes for it, encouraging it with offers to pay for relocation. There even are photographs of beautiful fields grown heavy with alfalfa—apparently a favorite food of gourmand groundhogs—but have only found, later, chewed up bits of the paperwork outside one of the two entrances to the burrow.<br/>   2) Is there a service that does not charge an arm and a leg for such relocation?  After all, if one groundhog is relocated, I am confident other groundhogs walking about the area looking for available homes will soon replace the fellow or gal recently moved. <br/>   3) Is there a service that will “live trap” the creature? I tried that last summer. A racoon and two pissed-off squirrels (and that racoon wasn’t all that happy) were caught in the trap. Lured by peanut butter and other treats, the unsuspecting creatures heard the snap of the door and were trapped. I think the groundhog sat a few feet away, safe inside its burrow, and chuckled at the spectacle.<br/>   4) I tried spraying coyote urine—yes, such substances are sold in stores—and, if anything, the groundhog seemed to enjoy the fragrance, although coyotes are natural predators of groundhogs.<br/>   My concern is for the structural integrity of the deck and the foundation of the house.<br/>   If anyone has suggestions, please post them. (I also am creeped out when I sit on the deck with the knowledge the groundhog is underneath, staring up at me, plotting nefarious ways of stealing pears from any tree I might plant.)<br/>   I have repented of the genocidal days of my youth when a few groundhogs were shot by me. If there are a heaven and hell, I will serve some time in the latter with several groundhogs standing over me with whips, beating me as I reach for a pear—eternally out of reach.<br/>   So—please let me know. I figure I will have to fill in the spaces under the deck as follow-up.<br/>      </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

Mayflower® moving trucks, as everyone well knows, transported the Colts from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1983.<br/>   The Colts now have played as the team of Indianapolis longer than as the team of Charm City.<br/>   Professional sports franchises had relocated before the Colts’ move from Baltimore.  Citizens of Baltimore still seem to bristle when the Ravens play the Colts, but those fans should be careful.  “Their” Baltimore Orioles Major League Baseball® team originally played in Milwaukee as the Brewers (for one season), before a move to St. Louis as the St. Louis Browns. <br/>   Those times were different.  Indianapolis shelled out money for a new football stadium, offered sweet tax incentives, and enabled the owners of the Colts to reach billionaire status—in a business that is a monopoly. At the time, one article I read reported the deal made the Colts the most profitable franchise in the NFL®. <br/>   Indianapolis provided an example of what other cities could do to lure professional franchises. The football Cardinals relocated to Arizona from St. Louis. St. Louis, not to be outdone, offered spiffy incentives and the Rams moved East from Los Angeles.  The late Al Davis had moved his Raiders from Oakland to L.A., then back to Oakland.  What is reported as the second-largest media market in the United States—Los Angeles—was left without a team in the most popular professional sport.<br/>   Now Los Angeles area folks discuss construction of a $1.8 billion stadium. There is no plan for expansion of the NFL®, so a team would have to relocated from another place.<br/>   Owners of the San Diego Chargers® are in talks with San Diego leaders in an attempt to leverage a new stadium. Oakland Coliseum is old, suffers from plumbing and electrical problems, and is the home of a professional football team that has moved before—twice.<br/>   One wonders what lucre cities will offer to keep their beloved teams, and what Los Angeles will offer as incentives for other teams to move.<br/>   There was an old adage that “there oughtta be a law,” to embody how government should respond to a problem. Ronald Reagan’s that government is not the solution but is the problem—a variation of a saying of one of his former constituents, Eldridge Cleaver (if you are not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem)—caused that phrase to be shelved for a while.<br/>   I am a sports fan. I particularly enjoy baseball. I watch college hoops. (I am trying to avoid watching football, because of the head injuries suffered by the athletes. That matter is for another blog.)<br/>   However, there should be Federal legislation that bans subsidization of professional sports. The leagues are monopolies. The owners are rich. To allow municipalities or States to subsidize the franchises only means those governments—not the owners’ teams—will engage in ruthless competition to land a franchise. Ultimately, the lure of jobs—however ephemeral or low-paying—will trump all else as taxes completely are eliminated for professional sports.<br/>   We have streets, schools, police, parks, libraries, and other matters about which to worry and for which to spend public monies. <br/>   While I enjoyed reading “On the Road” by Jack Kerouac, I do not enjoy paying higher taxes so the owner of the Colts can buy the original manuscript of Kerouac’s novel.<br/>   And remember—franchise owners’ threats can be made at any time. We have built two stadiums for the Colts—and still pay for the bonds used to build the first stadium, The Hoosier Dome. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   On March 1, 1980, I moved to Lafayette, Indiana. I obtained employment on the clerical staff at Purdue University, across the Wabash River from where I crashed on a friend’s couch. A few months later I moved to a basement apartment in the student ghetto. At 15 North Salisbury, I paid $112.50 for my half of the rent, and the price included all utilities and basic cable. I did not own a car. My job, in the Life Sciences Library, was a six-block walk from my residence. A grocery store (Smitty’s) was on the levee, about four blocks away. Between home and work were Harry’s and The Stabilizer. I did not need a car.  A car would have been an expensive luxury in my circumstances. If I traveled out of town for a weekend, I took either Amtrak, Greyhound, or rode with friends whose destination was the same.  I did not have a telephone. I could make calls from a pay phone or from work. If someone really wanted to talk with me all that much, the person could come over to my apartment.<br/>   My job at Purdue was necessary for the way libraries functioned then. I checked out books for students, monitored overdue books, searched for items people could not find, and answered questions about the use of the library.<br/>   I was surprised at how quickly I was hired.  I placed my application with Purdue’s hiring office (whatever it was called then) in the morning, interviewed with the libraries in the early afternoon, and was hired by later afternoon. My first official day of work—at a job not with a business owned by a member of my family—was March 17. The money I had in my pockets that day I had derived from sale of plasma at Plasma Alliance, also on the levee. <br/>   As I later learned, Purdue had a labor pool that was limited. College graduates were relatively scarce in the area around West Laughalot.  <br/>   For my work I received $3.95 per hour. The pay was booted up to $4.05 (as I recall) in July. In the fall, I received $4.35 per hour. My co-workers were married, had families, had lives outside of work. The library was open from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday (I cannot recall the hours on Friday), about the same on Saturday, and 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday. A full-time staff member had to be there until 8 p.m. on weekdays. The same was true for Sundays. I volunteered to do Sunday (full shift) and Monday through Thursday evenings.     <br/>   Purdue’s pay was lousy, but (1) we had “flex-time,” which meant one had paid time-off for up to 15 days per year and (2) my cost of living was very low—$112.50 for rent and utilities, with cheap pizza at Garcia’s or in the Student Union.<br/>   Since Mitch Daniels was designated by the Purdue University Board of Trustees, a great many of whom owe their appointments to that body to him, he has gained notice for austerity measures, the chief goal of which has been to stabilize students’ tuition.<br/>   Anytime I see the former governor’s name in print, I shudder a bit. A lot of people lost pensions—pensions they had earned—because of him, before he was even governor. He was busted for selling acid (a/k/a LSD) while in undergrad at Princeton in the 1970s. How in the hell did he manage that? Somebody “narked” on a classmate at a private university—Ivy League at that—for dealing hallucinogenic drugs in the 1970s? That would seem to indicate classmates and former customers were not fond of Mitch.<br/>   An item in the Indiana Law Blog caught my eyes this morning. The item quotes articles by Dave Bangert in The Lafayette Journal &amp; Courier.  In one, a Purdue clerical employee is quoted: “Those on the bottom [of the 15,000 employees at Purdue] are feeling crushed. A number of clerical and service staff live below the 2015 federal poverty guidelines.”<br/>   The upshot is Mitch is doing what he has grown accustomed to doing. In this instance, he has cut personal days available to employees, lined up health insurance policies that have higher deductibles, and ended the ability of employees to build up sick leave to cash out when those employees retire. When pensions are not offered to clerical staff, they make do where they can. <br/>Veterinary teaching hospital administrator Mimi Arighi was quoted: “If our pay wasn’t top dollar we used to be able to say, ‘Hey, we have tremendous benefits.’” Now? “‘We’ll have tremendous problems recruiting.’”<br/>   I do not see Purdue cutting some of the fat off two of its top salaries. The head football coach and the men’s basketball coach rake in a lot. About the time Purdue wins the NCAA ®—hell, even makes it to the Final Four ® as the Boilermakers have done twice (1969 and 1980)—the men’s basketball coach should receive the $2 mil the Indianapolis daily newspaper, on July 9, 2014, reported he was paid per year.  (What about the women’s basketball coach, a program that has won the NCAA®? The J &amp; C reported on 5/24/14, Sharon Versyp would make just over $600K, after various perks. <br/>   I had thought Purdue was a marvelous place to live and work, between college and whatever lay ahead. My co-workers needed those jobs. So do the people on staff there now. Too bad the members of the Purdue University Board of Trustees chose Mitch over all those other candidates with experience as university presidents. Oh wait—there was a reaon he was zipped to the front of the line.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   The number of days trash pick-up has been canceled worries me. I think the administration of Greg “Give Me a Reason to Toss Sweet Deals to Pals” Ballard will use the days trash pick-up have been canceled this winter as a pre-text for final privatization of that service by the City.<br/>   First, let me say that I understand what it is like to work in sub-zero weather. During college, I worked for my old man’s construction company. His company was union, but there was an exemption for direct family members of contractors. That did not mean I was paid the union wage (I think it was about $13 per hour) of the time. I was paid three bucks per hour. The exemption meant I could touch sheet metal—as in carry fittings, help put them in place, etc.<br/>   When I was home for the break that covered the pagan celebration of Winter Solstice—what others erroneously celebrate as Jesus’s birthday—the company had a contract with one of the car factories in Kokomo. I believe it was Chrysler, but frankly, from my perspective across the flat deck of a roof outside, or through cross-beams 60 feet or so inside, the company for which the work was performed did not press on my mind.<br/>   The temperature was ten degrees below zero. The job was to move “dust collectors” as I recall—huge units, big bastards 30 feet or so tall that filtered air and connected to exhaust things on the roof—from one part of the plant to another. Simply to walk in that kind of weather is a pain. To try and work with tools is worse, because either one’s hands are in gloves and the manipulation of tools and other objects is difficult, or one suffers frostbite. The wind howled—I mean “howl” as in wild dogs from the infernal regions that led huge gusts—out of what seemed like every direction. The air inside the plant was heavy with a drizzle of machine oil, but much preferred to the plain across the roof.<br/>   The people who work on those trash trucks, even in good weather, have jobs I do not envy. The word “trash” is simple, but let us face what is in those garbage cans and bins: rotten food, broken glass, and, after a series of garbage cans that might all weigh about the same, somebody loads one with highly dense objects of refuse. There also is the chance a live critter—read that as “rat”; okay, if you were unaware, now you know one of my phobias—will jump out of a trash can it had believed, until that moment, was it and its family’s new domicile.<br/>   Some of the guys stand on the back bumpers of the trash trucks. There also is a driver, of course. Everybody jumps down or out, from what I have seen, to grab the next cluster of trash cans. They lift heavy crap that we have thrown away, and the job is not easy.<br/>   Today’s trash pickup was canceled once again. (I tip my Cubs hat to Eye on Indianapolis for the “word” on this development.) The reason is the cold temperatures.<br/>   The past seven years have seen former Lieutenant Colonel and, for next 11 months or so, Mayor Ballard attempt to privatize anything he can privatize in Indianapolis. I understand, from stories on the web, that DPW made the call out of concern for the safety of its workers. I agree workers’ safety should be a priority.<br/>   I have this suspicion that someone on the next-to-top floor at City-County Building—the top floor is a museum; if you have not gone there, you should do so, before the Criminal Justice Center is built and City-County Building is given away to some foreign investors to develop as tax-free condos—might see a way in which this deep freeze can be used to privatize trash pick-up. Already Republic picks up trash. So does Ray’s. On its website, Ray’s observed it would be out picking up trash, and the cancellation affects only Marion County residents.<br/>   So that means one of several things:<br/>   1) Maybe Ray’s has equipment far superior to the equipment of DPW. If so, we should take some of the money shoveled at cricket fields and lobbyists and push it toward new trash pickup equipment. <br/>   2) Maybe there is a greater concern for the safety of workers at DPW than there is at Ray’s. If that is the case, our City government should cut back its contracts with those companies that expose their employees to unnecessary danger.<br/>   Under either of those notions, to privatize trash collection does not solve the problem. When we hit winter, temperatures will drop, sometimes to the minus-zero range, when few people are out and about. Whether trash pick-up is handled by the City or a private contractor, the temps will be the same.<br/>   Maybe I only am paranoid. Maybe those who run the City of Indianapolis harbor few thoughts of profit whenever possible at public expense. I am sure that, in other parts of the country, sanitation services never have been the source of skim for shady elements. (Tony Soprano was fictional and, besides, his work was in environmental clean-up.)<br/>   On the other hand, if the Republican Party manages to capture the White House in 2016, we might not have to worry about these super-sub-zero conditions. The Republican Party might just believe all this poppycock about “global warming” and try to pump out as much fossil fuels as possible. Donald Trump might eye the shores, now naked of glacial ice, of Antarctica for development by one of his companies (that seem to go into bankruptcy a lot).<br/>   And that’s where the Republican Party would be wrong. The theory is global climate change. Wild swings in temperatures are part of the phenomenon. <br/>   And that gets me back to Mayor Greg. He probably has his eyes on the way in which trash pickup is done in India. After all, they don’t have problems with trash pickup in sub-zero weather in Delhi—or the New (improved) Delhi.<br/><br/></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   Representatives of the United States government—members of Congress, officials in the executive branch—often talk about our “friend” and “ally” Saudi Arabia.<br/>   One needs to overlook a few unpleasant aspects of that country, the first part of the name of which is derived from the name of the family that has ruled it since the 1920s. There is the marked weakness of human rights. For example, to criticize the King or other governmental officials is also to risk imprisonment. There are plausible reasons for people in Arabia to express dissatisfaction with both King and government, since money from the country is funneled to members of the ruling family to play on the Riviera. Those big yachts—the phrase is not redundant; there are yachts, then there are BIG yachts, and Saudi princes favor Big—cost a pretty penny to purchase and, after purchase, to run. <br/>   Another aspect of society there is the restriction on women being able to drive. It is against the law there for a woman to drive a vehicle.<br/>   Historian Saleh Al-Saadoon, interviewed on Saudi Rotana Khalijiyya TV, said “women who drive in other countries such as the United States don’t care if they’re raped and that sexual violence ‘is no big deal to them.’” In an article from February 10 on The Huffington Post—this is a cue for those who shut out news when it originates from sources perceived as positioned to the left of center—Ed Mazza writes the historian claimed “women can be raped when a car breaks down, but unlike other countries, Saudi Arabia protects its women from that risk by not allowing them to drive.”  Al-Sadoon observed: “They don’t care if they are raped on the roadside, but we do.”<br/>   Al-Sadoon faced criticism from other guests on the show, and took another tack. (Is it appropriate to use a sailing term to describe an exchange in a country that consists mostly of desert?) He said women in his country are treated “like queens” “because they are driven around by the men of the family and male chauffeurs.” The show’s host suggested women could be raped by male chauffeurs.<br/>   The solution to that problem, Al-Sadoon replied, was “‘to bring in female foreign chauffeurs to drive our wives.’”<br/>   After all, one should reason, foreign hussies do not care if they are raped as they change tires at the sides of roads. In other parts of the Middle East, United States female military personnel face roadside peril, but from IEDs, all to further the “cause” of oil.. <br/>   There are several aspects of this story that are sad. Women live under an oppressive regime and risk lashing if convicted of driving. All the people live in Arabia under an oppressive regime and face punishment for a wide variety of “offenses.” The ultimate punishment is beheading, by sword, in the public square.<br/>   We in the United States pay billions to support the government of that country, as it is “oil-rich.” I also read there is a new all-electric BMW out, to complete with the Tesla. I can buy a windmill, generate electricity and drive all I want oil-free.<br/>   I am unaware of any women who “don’t care” if they are raped. I know of no women for whom sexual violence “is no big deal.” I even am unaware of any women—or men, for that matter—who look forward to a roadside breakdown. <br/>   Perhaps we can lend aid to the country of Arabia and send flyers from triple-A to them. Flood the country with applications for AAA and its roadside assistance. I have had good experiences—across the board—with that organizations and the folks who work for it. In the meantime, we should reconsider our support of that kingdom. There is no indication Al-Sadoon spoke for the Saudi family, but his views are consistent with the government’s laws.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   Sheila Kennedy blogged about the attempt by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to remove language from the University of Wisconsin’s mission statement that its mission it to “extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campus” and to “serve and stimulate society.” Ms. Kennedy reports Associated Press as noting “He also wanted to remove the statement ‘Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth.’”<br/>   Paul Ogden, at “Ogden on Politics,” took issue with Ms. Kennedy’s position that Walker’s is an anti-intellectual position “so rampant on the American Right. He is one of the (far too many) shallow and ambitious politicians who think education and job training are synonymous, that scholarly research and the ‘search for truth’ are elitist non-essentials, and that humans don’t need to know anything that isn’t immediately useful for obtaining gainful employment.  They’d have handed Socrates that cup of hemlock without thinking twice.”<br/>   Mr. Ogden agrees with part of Ms. Kennedy’s blog, but counters that “the intellectual world that Kennedy and I would like to live in, the one which values education simply for the knowledge received, is not the real world that the young adults of today face.” He goes on to point to the six-figure debt many of the students face upon graduation.<br/>   Mr. Ogden shifted the argument. His objection is not with the goal of higher education as the University of Wisconsin has stated for however many years. Rather, he points to an affectation of our system of higher education. Instead of higher education seen as part of our nation’s infrastructure, politicians have seen it as a sort of “luxury.” One person who replied to Ms. Kennedy’s blog noted then-Govern Ronald Reagan’s statement to that effect about California’s system of higher education. When Reagan took office, higher education was free to that State’s students. Now, corporations that toss out a lot of money in campaign contributions have gamed the system so they can prey on students who want to attend college.<br/>   Had Mr. Ogden continued his studies at Hanover College, perhaps he would have winnowed out the argument, instead of shifting. <br/>   We should encourage higher education. If a student has the ability and makes the grades, we should have a public university system available without the student having to pay tuition. Medical doctors, engineers, lawyers, and computer scientists are important to our society. Also important are anthropologists, historians, philosophers—and people with bachelors’ degrees in those fields who have a better understanding of the human condition. A lot of liberal arts majors become contractors and entrepreneurs. <br/>   Governor Walker, by the way, apparently lacks the fortitude to stand by the changes he proposed. As Ms. Kennedy notes: “When the proposed changes became public, the enormous blowback obviously took the Governor by surprise, and he backed off, initially suggesting the change was ‘a drafting error’ that hadn’t been caught.”<br/>   There should be no mistake about the situation: the tuition would not be “free.” Taxpayers would pay into a system that would enable students to pursue degrees. Those who favor privatization of everything are shocked by such prospects. What is more expensive, though, is an uneducated population. As a bumper sticker once said—if you think education is expensive, try ignorance.<br/> </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:293:"

<p>   As a fan of the Chicago Cubs National League Baseball Club®, I have experienced a lot of anguish. As a citizen of the United States, I have seen my rights erode concomitantly with bestowal of rights on corporations—fictional entities created to shield shareholders from liability (the most popular reason to incorporate).<br/>   Now a sports agent Scott Boras proposes playing The World Series on a neutral field. Boras criticizes the “surprise” of where The World Series is played as bad for the sport, according to Patrick Mooney, of Cubs Insider, wrote yesterday:  <br/>   “Most corporations and most journalists and most everyone involved—because you don’t know where the World Series is going to be until a day or two in advance—they have not budgeted for it ... There’s so much more we can do when we know where the World Series is at. We can have so many events. We can involve corporations. We can have national media, international media. (But not knowing) where the World Series is going to be is making it a regional event.”<br/>   When did it become so important for corporations to be happy? I know—the Chicago Cubs play in Wrigley Field, and Wrigley gum is manufactured by a corporation. The Cubs ball club is a corporate entity. Corporations, however, do not watch baseball. Corporations cannot watch anything. A corporation is a fictional entity. A corporation can no more watch The World Series than it can be punished criminally and sentenced to prison.<br/>   The article cites low viewer ratings for The World Series.<br/>   Yes, viewer ratings for The World Series have been low. There are a few things we could do, other than prostrate ourselves once again before sports machines, to get people more interested in the Series—and in the game of baseball.<br/>   1) There should be fewer playoff games. The playoffs should last—maybe—one week. By the time we get to The World Series, who remembers who is playing?<br/>   2) There should be more day games. I understand people want to watch the games after work, but baseball played during daytime is part of its appeal to many of us. Corporations cannot discern night from day: corporations are not sentient beings.<br/>   3) Opening pitch for a Series night game should be no later than 6 pm EST. I know to the extent that corporations can “want” anything, they want to appeal to viewers on the west coast. By the seventh inning, the clock here is almost at 12. Kids cannot stay up that late. That loses younger generations to other sports.<br/>   4) Baseball, generally, would improve if the season were shortened. More double headers could be played. I have written before: baseball is a summer game and we should not watch people sitting in stands freezing their asses off in November watching baseball. <br/>   5) And hurry up the play. Umps can do that under the current rules.<br/>   So, I say screw Scott Boras. At least his suggestion is too late to affect the 2015 World Series. After all, as Professor Brown says in “Back to the Future,” the Chicago Cubs win The World Series in 2015.<br/>   I will take a prediction by a character of fiction—Professor Brown—over the imagined desires of a fictional entity—corporation—any day.  <br/><br/></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"term";s:13:"United States";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:512;s:7:"headers";a:14:{s:4:"date";s:91:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:54:35 GMT, Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:47:36 GMT, Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:47:36 GMT";s:6:"server";s:20:"Ning HTTP Server 2.0";s:7:"expires";s:60:"Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT, Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";s:10:"set-cookie";s:284:"xn_visitor=815c6a2a-69dc-4fca-bb82-eb7ff157cdcc;Path=/;Domain=.civildiscoursenow.com;Expires=Sun, 22-Feb-26 19:54:35 GMT, ning_session=TxC6/w5lzA2nxxCSQqbWGYM5rZMAyUnSbcVE6bYdh5qO62d3rvm/49fDNxw6A7AqIi/B4rHBmNA=;Path=/;Domain=.civildiscoursenow.com;Expires=Thu, 25-Feb-16 20:54:35 GMT";s:16:"x-xn-trace-token";s:36:"84e313bd-0f7f-4a97-8027-3837a61b7798";s:11:"x-xn-xnhtml";s:5:"false";s:4:"vary";s:16:"X-XN_APPLICATION";s:3:"p3p";s:36:"CP=UNI STA LOC CURa OURa COR ALL IND";s:18:"xg-bazel-validslug";s:5:"false";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:47:36 UTC";s:13:"cache-control";s:30:"max-age=0, no-cache=Set-Cookie";s:12:"content-type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"57635";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130725002037";}
