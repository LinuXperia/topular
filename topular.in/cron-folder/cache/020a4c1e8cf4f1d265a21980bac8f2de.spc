            <b>LOUISVILLE, Ky. —</b> American Pharoah won the 141st Kentucky Derby on Saturday, ridden by last year's Derby-winning jockey, Victor Espinoza. <p></p>

The 5-2 favorite was in contention at the top of the stretch and pulled clear at the finish for his fifth win in six starts. <p></p>

"He's been a special horse since I first rode him," said Espinoza, who now has three Derby wins. <p></p>

Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert got his fourth Derby win, and also sent out third-place finisher Dortmund. <p></p>

Firing Line was second. <p></p>

The time was 2:03.02 for the 1 1/4 miles. The largest Derby crowd ever — 170,513 — looked on under sunny skies. <p></p>

The four Derby wins ties Baffert with D. Wayne Lukas and Herbert "Derby Dick" Thompson for second on the all-time list. <p></p>

"We were ready to rumble," Baffert said. <p></p>

The race unfolded with Dortmund setting the pace and Firing Line tracking in second. American Pharoah sat comfortably in third. <p></p>

Turning for home, American Pharoah angled outside of the other two and launched a rally for a one-length victory. <p></p>

"Turning for home, I thought I got it. The other horse was right next to me. I couldn't just blow him away," Espinoza said. <p></p>

American Pharoah paid $7.80, $5.80, $4.20. <p></p>

Firing Line returned $8.40 and $5.40 while Dortmund paid $4.20 to show. <p></p>

            Buster Posey and Brandon Crawford homered, Tim Hudson pitched into the ninth and the Giants beat the Los Angeles Angels 5-4 Saturday. <p></p>

Nori Aoki had two RBIs and Casey McGehee had three hits and drove in a run for the Giants, who won their fourth straight at home and eighth of 12 overall. <p></p>

Albert Pujols and Mike Trout homered in the same game for the 20th time with the Angels, who have lost four of six. <p></p>

Hudson (1-2) retired the first 10 batters he faced and gave up three runs, two hits and two walks in eight-plus innings. He struck out three. <p></p>

Hudson walked Kole Calhoun in the fourth, and Calhoun was then caught stealing. Hudson also walked the last batter he faced, pinch-hitter Colin Cowgill to open the ninth. <p></p>

Sergio Romo got two outs, including a strikeout of Pujols with two runners on. Jeremy Affeldt gave up an RBI single to Kole Calhoun, and Santiago Casilla allowed and RBI single to David Freese. <p></p>

Casilla then got the last out for his seventh save when Matt Joyce's single hit pinch-runner Taylor Featherston between first and second. <p></p>

Hector Santiago (2-2) allowed four runs on nine hits in his five innings of work. <p></p>

Crawford's homer was just the second Santiago has allowed to a left-hander since joining the Angels, a span of 188 at bats. Texas' Shin-Soo Choo connected against Santiago exactly a year ago. <p></p>

<b>NOTES:</b> Pujols (left hamstring tightness) passed his Friday audition and was in the starting lineup. ... RHP Jake Peavy (lower back strain) threw about 25 fastballs in a bullpen session before the game and reported progress. He'll throw another bullpen session on Tuesday and could start a rehab assignment after that. OF Hunter Pence (broken bone in left hand) took fly balls and was given the OK to take batting practice on the field Sunday. <p></p>

            In Bob Myers, Dick Vertlieb now has company in the Warriors history book.<p></p>
On Friday, Myers became the second recipient of the 2014-15 NBA Executive of the Year in franchise history. Vertlieb captured the award when he engineered the Warriors’ lone league championship in the Bay Area 40 years ago.<p></p>
“It’s a testament to the entire group,” coach Steve Kerr said. “Bob will be the first to say that. The trophy will go on his shelf, but it’s something the entire organization should take great pride in.”<p></p>
Myers, who spent 14 years as a sports agent, totaled 82 points and received 13 of the 30 first-place votes from a panel of league executives. He beat out the Cleveland Cavaliers’ David Griffin (69 points, eight first-place votes) and the Atlanta Hawks’ Mike Budenholzer (36 points, four first-place votes).<p></p>
While Griffin certainly made the loudest moves last offseason by bringing LeBron James and Kevin Love to Cleveland, it was Myers’ restraint and off-the-court changes that likely helped him win the award.<p></p>
Myers also made the difficult decision to let go of coach Mark Jackson following two straight playoff appearances. He brought in Kerr even though the then TNT analyst had no previous experience at the position.<p></p>  
The front office decided to stay put in the Love sweepstakes, electing not to make Klay Thompson available via trade. On the heels of a four-year, $70-million contract extension, Thompson responded with the best season of his career. He earned an All-Star selection for the first time.<p></p>
Those are but two of the integral accomplishments in Myers’ three-year tenure, which include selecting Harrison Barnes (seventh overall) and Draymond Green (35th) in the 2012 draft. He also signed Stephen Curry to a four-year, $44-million deal before the 2012-13 season, and the guard subsequently blossomed into a Most Valuable Player candidate and one of the best contract values in the league.<p></p>
Myers also acquired Andre Iguodala, Marresse Speights, Leandro Barbosa and Shaun Livingston in the last two off-seasons to round out one of the most efficient benches in the league.

            After selecting Alabama wide receiver Amari Cooper with the No. 4 overall selection in this year’s NFL draft, Raiders coach Jack Del Rio made little secret about his stoically confident approach.<p></p>
“You’ll see when he’s here, he’s very serious about football,” Del Rio said. “Very business-like in his approach, a fairly quiet, soft-spoken young man, mature. Football is very important to him.”<p></p>
At his introduction in Alameda on Friday, Cooper backed up his new coach’s words. With the franchise’s three Vince Lombardi trophies at his back, and general manager Reggie McKenzie and Del Rio at his sides, perhaps the loudest thing about the 6-foot-1, 210-pound first-rounder was his deep-black, crushed-velvet blazer.<p></p>
When pushed about whether playing in the NFL was the main dream he had growing up, Cooper replied with a simple “Yes.”<p></p>
Cooper’s selection was followed by a pair of important early-round selections on Friday. In the second round, the Raiders selected defensive end Mario Edwards Jr., a 6-foot-3, 279-pound defensive end. The Florida State product was an All-ACC First Team and All-American selection in 2014, when he posted 11 tackles for a loss and three sacks. He had 89 tackles and eight sacks in his career.<p></p>
Edwards, who started as a true freshman in 2012, also brings a strong genetic pedigree. His father Mario played in the NFL from 2000 to 2005.
But the player who will be counted on to make the most immediate impact is Cooper, who was reportedly the top prospect on a number of team’s draft boards.<p></p>
The 2014 Fred Biletnikoff Award-winner took questions for about 10 minutes on an array of topics, including a handful about his demeanor. At one point, he was even asked to speak up by a television videographer.<p></p>
When asked how playing in the SEC translates into the NFL: “I really can’t answer that, because I’ve never played in the NFL.”<p></p>
In fact, in many ways, the 20-year-old Miami native’s matter-of-fact approach was by and large refreshingly truthful. He will wear the No. 19 jersey, which was worn by one-time Raiders wide receiver Randy Moss, whom he emulated as a kid.<p></p>
And when asked specifically where his direct, “no-maintenance” approach came, he responded, “I’m really not sure. It’s just how I’ve always been. It’s really hard for me to answer that question.”<p></p>
Indeed, Cooper seems to save his loudest statements for the field, as evidenced by his 31 career touchdowns (most in SEC history) and 1,727 yards receiving in his junior campaign. It will be just fine for Raider fans should quarterback Derek Carr’s new target bring that same level of production to O.co Coliseum next season.<p></p>
“It seems like he can [run routes] with his eyes closed,” McKenzie said. “He’s exceptionally quick, fast and understands the game. You can tell the guy’s been playing football and playing that position all his life. He’s an extremely hard worker and you don’t hear any negatives about this guy, so it’s no wonder he’s as good as he is because the intangibles outside of his skill set are extremely high.”<p></p>
Cooper joins newly signed Michael Crabtree in a revamped Raiders’ receiving corps, alongside James Jones (team-high 73 catches last season) and Andre Holmes (team-leading 693 yards).<p></p> 
Although the franchise has not posted an 1,000 yard receiver since Moss in 2005 — Tim Brown, drafted in 1988, was the last Raiders draft pick to accomplish the feat — Carr now has a full-compliment of wideouts to potentially end that drought.<p></p>
Starting with Cooper, who’ll get his chance to show off his intensely business-like approach at practice in just a few short months.<p></p>
“I just treat practice as if it’s a game,” Cooper said. “I try to visualize me running those routes in practice like I’m running them in the game, so I just take practice really serious. That’s it.”<p></p>
That quality and deep dedication was certainly not lost on team management.<p></p>
“I think that mindset he brings is one that we are building here in terms of understanding the correlation between practice and the performance you give during practice,” Del Rio said. “Having a healthy appreciation of that is a good thing, and that we’re working very hard to develop to make sure guys understand that.”

            <b>LAS VEGAS —</b> The human instinct isn’t merely to root for Manny Pacquiao. It’s also to hug him, hang with him, croon silly songs with him, read Bible verses with him, try to understand why he wears a permanent smile when everyone else in life seemingly must force one. The public polls predicting he’d win Saturday night, the money wagered in his favor, the range of celebrities who adore him — those aren’t sentiments from the head, where the smart action was on Floyd Mayweather.<p></p>
They come from the heart, through which Pacquiao has connected with people in ways Mayweather never could without a personality transplant.
“Thank you,” he whispered to a scowling Mayweather at the Friday weigh-in, unable to suppress a small grin during a staredown that lasted only 15 seconds because Pacquiao kept looking away.<p></p>
Thanked him for what?<p></p>
“Thanked him for the fans that the fight will happen,” he said. “I believe that the fight must happen because the fans deserve it. This is a great, great responsibility. The fans deserve a good fight.”<p></p>
Let’s not be naive: Pacquiao stands to earn upwards of $120 million thanks to the power players who finally made the Fight That Wouldn’t Happen happen, which had much more to do with Hollywood mogul Leslie Moonves than a long-resistant Mayweather. Still, when you see Pacquiao stop in his red Nike hoodie inside MGM Grand Garden Arena and take a smiling selfie as famed fight barker Michael Buffer chants, “THE FIGHTING PRIDE OF THE PHILLIPINES, HERE HE IS, THE PAC-MAN, MANNYYYYY PACQUIAOWWWWWWWW!!!” — you realize the man is much more in love with life than himself. So do Mark Wahlberg, Dave Chappelle, Tim Tebow, Sly Stallone, Jimmy Kimmel, Robert Duvall and other show-biz types who have pledged allegiance and stopped by his training sessions.<p></p>
If sport can breed goodness amid an inexorable swirl of greed and hubris, then Pacquiao would pack up his Manny Love motorhome and flee the 90-degree desert heat as his generation’s pound-for-pound champ. It wouldn’t take much decency, of course, to eclipse Mayweather, who irritates us in pointing out his wealth as the world’s highest-paid athlete — “Let’s say I make $200 million. That means my kids will get $50 million apiece,” he said, nailing the week’s math test — and disturbs us in how he pooh-poohs five cases of domestic violence allegations against him. As opined by Pacquiao’s trainer, Freddie Roach, “When Manny beats Mayweather, it won’t only be about unifying the welterweight titles. It will also be a public service to boxing.”<p></p>
And to humankind.<p></p>
Yet even if Mayweather ignores the morality play, extends his tactical brilliance to 48-0 and dispatches his opponent back to the House of Representatives in the Philippines, where he is serving his second term, Pacquiao will endure as a warm, affable charmer who relates to fans worldwide. It helps that he rose from nothing, overcoming abject poverty to learn basics of the fight game in his native streets, showing up raw
at Roach’s strip-mall gym in Hollywood and becoming one of Forbes’ top 10 sports earners last year. It helps that Pacquiao is fighting for the Filipino people more than he’s fighting for his legacy, which is considerable in boxing and sport. It helps that he speaks publicly about his struggles after his breakthrough win over Oscar De La Hoya in 2008, when he cashed in newfound stardom for a partying lifestyle — drinking, gambling, womanizing — only to save his career and marriage when he abandoned Catholicism and became a born-again Christian. He is not perfect, but unlike his rival, he’ll acknowledge it.<p></p>
“I feel the Lord is always with me and gives me strength,” Pacquiao said. “I am at peace with myself.”<p></p>
With such soothing, non-violent thoughts come concerns that Pacquiao has lost his edge. Roach has said as much, relating that Manny’s mother, Dionisia, thought his religious transition was responsible for a knockout loss, to Juan Manuel Marquez in 2012, that almost sent Pacquiao into retirement. But don’t discount the possibility this could be a version of verbal rope-a-dope, with Mayweather as the dope. Just because Pacquiao is calm on the exterior doesn’t mean he isn’t burning inside, recalling how Mayweather, in 2010, referred to him as “that little yellow chump” and “Pooch-iao.”<p></p>
“I cannot say that he is that difficult an opponent,” Pacquiao said during the week. “My confidence right now is different than the other fights I’ve had. I feel excited, this is it. I have to prove something.”<p></p>
While they both will fight a few pounds short of 150, Pacquaio gives up inches to Mayweather. “He is a little bit bigger, but like David and Goliath, size doesn’t matter,” Roach said. “We are the better puncher, and we are faster.”<p></p>
Mayweather, too, says he has a burden of proof. “I’ve never wanted to win a fight this bad in my life,” he said. But his is a self-induced burden, all because of a mouth that can’t stop mentioning money. How curious to hear him say, “Everyone talks about the money, the money, the money. I want the fight to live up to its magnitude. That’s what it’s really about.”
Then shut up, already.<p></p>
It may be too late to help Mayweather. When asked which was more important — legacy or money — he said, “At the end of the day, my daughter can’t eat no zero. She can’t spend a boxing ring.” This came after he claimed his career has surpassed that of the great Muhammad Ali, who has stood for far more in life than a mansion and private jet.<p></p>
Ali’s daughter, Laila, responded by calling Mayweather “a little boy” and “broken person.” Former champion Roy Jones Jr., who will analyze the fight on TV, says he’ll be concerned about his “lonely” state of mind if he loses. Everyone is piling on Money Mayweather.<p></p>
It’s trite to refer to a sports event as “good versus evil.’’ This time, in a colossal moment for boxing, the theme applies. We have a villain.
We have a darling.<p></p>

            <p></p>
To say the least, I like the Warriors’ chances against the Memphis Grizzlies in Round 2 of the playoffs, especially with point guard Mike Conley likely to sit out at least one of the games and probably more. With the type of serious facial injury he has, a blow to that area could have serious consequences. Team physicians will be very cautious about how they handle the situation.<p></p>

Even with Conley on the court, the Warriors won two of the three games between the teams in the regular season. One of the two losses suffered by the Dubs at home this season, however, came at the hands of Memphis.<p></p>

The biggest issue is how the Warriors will handle the Grizzlies’ front line, in particular, two-time All-Stars Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph.<p></p>

This powerful duo combined to average nearly 33 points and 18 rebounds per game during the regular season. They have put up comparable numbers in the playoffs. <p></p>

The reason for my concern about Gasol and Randolph goes back to the unfortunate existence of “playoff basketball,” where the game slows down, becomes more physical and a large inside presence can be a major factor in winning games.<p></p>

With that said, so far, the Warriors are not allowing the game to slow down and continue to play their exciting, up-tempo offense. They are also dealing well with the physical play and are doing a fantastic job establishing an inside presence with their offensive rebounding. For stretches, the Dubs are displaying a tough, defensive brand of basketball.<p></p>

Surprisingly, the Warriors out-rebounded Memphis in all three of the previous games, yet allowing second-chance opportunities continues to be an area of deficiency. During the regular season, the Warriors ranked just 18th in defensive rebounding. Fortunately, the Grizzlies are not ranked high in the offensive rebounding category.<p></p>

Defense, however, may just be what the Grizzlies can count on to challenge the Warriors. True, the Dubs led the league in that department, allowing 98.2 points per  game, but Memphis wasn’t far behind in fourth place at 99.9 points per game.<p></p>

In the playoffs, the Grizzlies held the Portland Trail Blazers to 100 points per game and the Warriors allowed the New Orleans Pelicans to score 104 points per game. Therefore, the Warriors must execute effectively and efficiently on the offensive end of the court in order to overcome the more- than-competent defense of the Grizzlies. <p></p>

Taking care of the ball and limiting foolish turnovers will be critical. Turnovers can lead to easy transition baskets, which the Warriors allow too frequently. Meanwhile, in the first round of the playoffs, Memphis had the fewest turnovers per game of any team with just eight per game. The Dubs averaged 14 per game.<p></p>

Statistically, the Warriors were definitely the superior team during the regular season, especially on offense, where the Grizzlies trailed by substantial margins in almost all categories, most notably in points scored per game (98-110) and 3-point shooting percentage (34 percent-40 percent), which is significant. Ironically, during these playoffs, Memphis is actually shooting a higher percentage than Golden State from beyond the arc, 46 percent to 38 percent, and also from the charity stripe, an impressive 87 percent to 70 percent.<p></p>

Looking at match-ups on paper and using statistics to predict outcomes makes for interesting possibilities. However, you still have to play the games. Unless the Warriors turn ice cold on the offensive end of the court for extended periods of time and their defense decides to take a vacation, I see no way that the Grizzlies can beat them four times. Make it Warriors in five.<p></p>

            <p></p>
For seven long days, we learned that the Warriors’ toughest playoff opponent might not be the Memphis Grizzlies or the San Antonio Spurs or anyone else.<p></p>

Could it really be this thing called Rust? <p></p>

Just who plays for Rust isn’t quite clear — Wilt Chamberlain, Julius Erving and Magic Johnson in their primes? — but it’s a dangerous team, we’ve been told. As they concern the Warriors, though, the numbers say Rust is almost as o-ver-ra-ted as Dwight Howard these days. <p></p>

In the regular season, the Warriors had a 4-0 record when they played with at least three days of rest. Granted, that’s a small sample size. Yet the statistics are so dominant — especially on offense — one can’t ignore them. Their average margin of victory was 14 points, four more than their season average.<p></p>

Logic says an extended layoff can throw an offense out of whack, but the Warriors don’t do logic this season. They shot a lights-out 43 percent from 3-point range and 51 percent overall in those games. Their ball movement was noticeably better — they had assists on 71 percent of their field goals compared to 66 overall. <p></p>

If the healthy, well-rested Warriors lose more than one game in the series, somebody named Rusty won’t beat them. Balls bets it will be Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph.  <p></p>



<b>DUBS ARE HARD TO READ:</b> When Kerr was a member of Michael Jordan’s supporting cast, Chicago Bulls head coach Phil Jackson would suggest book titles for his players during extended layoffs in the postseason. Kerr chose not to go that route last week, but the reason wasn’t what you think.<p></p>

“Yes, all our players can read, I think,” Kerr joked.<p></p>

Team player that he was, Kerr once read “All The Pretty Horses” (Cormac McCarthy) from cover to cover.  <p></p>

“Phil sort of liked to tie the book to your own background,” Kerr told Balls. “He knew that I had lived in Arizona and attended college there. It’s a very literary book with some beautiful prose. It’s a good story, but it’s not an easy read. It’s not for everyone.”<p></p>

That includes Dennis Rodman.<p></p>

Jackson did ask Rodman to read Sacred Hoops in hopes that it would inspire him. He wasn’t interested because the book didn’t contain any dirty pictures, rumor has it. <p></p>



<b>BASKET MYERS, ASSIST WEST:</b> Bob Myers was a reasonable choice for NBA Executive of the Year honors based on his decision to hire Kerr alone. But the award should be loaned to head consultant Jerry West for a few weeks at least, not that he needs another one.   <p></p>

West was instrumental in the decision to keep the Klay Thompson-Stephen Curry backcourt intact and not to pursue Kevin Love last fall.<p></p>

Now that Thompson and Draymond Green have taken their games to All-Star levels and Love has an arm in a sling, we know how that could have turned out.<p></p>



<b>MAYBE THEY’LL GROW ON US:</b> The best thing Balls can say about the 49ers’ new alternative uniforms is, thank god we won’t see those ugly things more than twice a season.<p></p>

The all-black unies don’t have nearly enough gold, which is the primary Super Bowl 50 color. The red names and numbers are difficult to read. And the jersey and helmet are an odd match, sort of like Jim Harbaugh and Jed York on their worst days. <p></p>



<b>OH, THOSE SASSY RAIDERS:</b> Even the Raiders couldn’t resist a jab at their cross-Bay rivals when they unveiled their supposed new uniforms in a mock tweet had some of their fans in a panic. “49ers go all black, Raiders go gold to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl,” they pretended to announce.  <p></p>

Which was the funniest thing the Raiduhs did on the first day of the draft. Other than take a pass on future Pro Bowl lineman Leonard Williams, of course.<p></p>



<b>RUN FOR COVER:</b> Jameis Winston got in trouble when the quarterback walked out of a store with $34 worth crab legs and crawfish that he somehow forgot to pay for. So when the first pick in the draft posted an Instagram of himself with a wide smile on his face, a Tampa Bay Buccaneers cap on his head and a tray of crab legs in front of him, the critics were quick to sack him. <p></p>

It turns out that the crab legs had been sent by Capt. Keith Coburn of “The Deadliest Catch,” and Winston’s response was nothing more than a thank-you note. A few weeks earlier, Coburn asked the kid to help him auction off a king crab at a charity event.<p></p>

Hopefully, Winston has learned a lesson that, in this age of social media, his every move will be watched and analyzed more than ever.<p></p>

        A 26-year-old San Francisco man who was convicted of murder for the stabbing death of Angelo Zuniga in 2008, and later attempted to have a witness killed, has been sentenced to 25 years and eight months to life in prison, the District Attorney's Office announced Friday.<p><p/>
Martin Martinez was acting belligerent at an Oct. 24, 2008 high school Halloween party in Ingleside before the murder, and tried to start a fight with two other partygoers.<p><p/>
Martinez became enraged when Zuniga started dancing with his sister, which prompted the violent stabbing that followed. Martinez then fled and ditched the murder weapon and his blood-stained shirt, but he was arrested hours later.<p><p/>
While awaiting trial, which began in June 2012, Martinez used his connections with Norteno gang members to kill a witness. But his coded messages from jail were discovered and additional charges were filed against him.<p><p/>
In the messages sent to get a witness killed, Martinez told his Norteno connections, "You need to smack him before my trial. I'm not coming home if he get on the stand."<p><p/>
Martinez also attempted to have another witness lie on the stand in order to make the murder look like self-defense. In another message, Martinez wrote, "I need him to get on the stand and say that the dude pulled a knife on me, and when the light came on, the knife disappeared, dudes knife disappeared. I need to beat this case."<p><p/> 
Superior Court Judge Kay Tsenin ordered Martinez turned over to state correction after the sentencing Friday.<p><p/>

        by The Associated Press
            Drivers who picketed several trucking firms at the nation's busiest seaport complex returned to work Friday after a weeklong strike they say will not be their last.
</p><p>
A few hundred truckers staged a strike against four companies that haul goods from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, according to organizers of the action.
</p><p>
The overall effect of the strike, which began Monday, at ports that handle hundreds of billions of dollars of international trade each year was not huge. About 16,000 truckers work the two ports.
</p><p>
Though the truckers did not win any concessions from companies they say underpay them by treating them as independent contractors, rather than fulltime employees, they couldn't afford to keep striking, according to Barb Maynard of Justice for LA/LB Port Drivers, the campaign to unionize the drivers.
</p><p>
"They've got mouths to feed. They've got families. They entered this strike knowing it wasn't going to be the only strike," Maynard said.
</p><p>
By Friday afternoon, workers returned to all four companies, Maynard said.
</p><p>
A spokesman for an association representing trucking firms says the end of the strike is good for everyone involved. "We are glad everyone is getting back to work," said Weston LaBar, executive director of the Harbor Trucking Association.
</p><p>
The Teamsters union has been trying to organize drivers at the ports, saying their employers are engaged in what Maynard called "persistent wage theft" because as independent contractors, drivers must pay their own expenses.</p><p>

</p><p>
Yemen's Shiite rebels attacked Saudi border posts, sparking fierce fighting overnight that killed three Saudi troops and dozens of rebels, the kingdom said. Saudi-led airstrikes continued to bomb rebel positions inside Yemen on Friday, including a strike in the capital, Sanaa, that killed at least 20 civilians.
</p><p>
The attack late Thursday by the rebels, known as Houthis, was the most dramatic border incident since Saudi Arabia launched an intense campaign of airstrikes against the rebels just over a month ago. It also brought to 11 the number of Saudi soldiers killed so far in border skirmishes during the air campaign.
</p><p>
The assault underscored how the Iran-backed Houthis are still capable of launching major operations despite the airstrikes that have relentlessly targeted their positions and those of their allies — military units loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</p><p>
The Saudi-led offensive, which started March 26, aims to diminish the military capabilities of the Houthis, who have overrun the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and are advancing deep into the country's south.
</p><p>
The U.N. says at least 550 civilians have been killed so in the war, whether from airstrikes or ground fighting.
</p><p>
Yemen's internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled the country in March, is now based in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, along with most of his government. There have been recent calls by officials in exile for a Saudi-led ground invasion to restore Hadi's government to power.
</p><p>
"There must be a direct military intervention ... to stop Saleh and the Houthis," Yemen's Transportation Minister Mohammed Badr Bassalma told Al-Arabiya satellite TV on Friday, speaking from Riyadh.
</p><p>
Also Friday, the U.N. Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Yemen, following warnings by U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon who said the previous day that basic services in the impoverished Arab country are "on the brink of collapse." Ban also called for an immediate ceasefire, or at least humanitarian pauses to help the desperate civilians.
</p><p>
There have been conflicting figures on the death toll since the air campaign started. Ban's office said Thursday that more than 1,200 people have been killed in the conflict, which has turned into a kind of proxy war between Yemen's powerful neighbor Saudi Arabia and Iran. Many of those dead have been civilians. Hadi's government in exile says at least 1,000 civilians have died.
</p><p>
On Friday, the Saudi-led coalition continued to pound rebel positions. One airstrike targeted a house of a top Houthi rebel commander in Sanaa's Saawan district, demolishing at least six houses and killing at least 20 civilians, including 10 women and children, officials and witnesses told an Associated Press reporter at the scene.
</p><p>
In the southern port city of Aden — Hadi's base before he fled to Riyadh— and in the city of Taiz, warplanes bombed positions of the Houthis and Saleh's forces killing scores of fighters, according to security officials. At least 12 people were killed because of ground fighting in Aden on Friday, according to medical officials who did not elaborate. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.
</p><p>
In the border attack, Houthi fighters in tanks and armored vehicles struck "border posts and control points" in the southern Saudi region of Najran on Thursday night, the kingdom's Defense Ministry said.
</p><p>
Saudi forces, backed by fighter jets, repelled the attack and "dozens of the militiamen were killed. Three soldiers of the ground troops were martyred," according to the statement, which did not clarify how far across the border the attackers came.
</p><p>
The kingdom's security forces said on April 11 that more than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed in border clashes, mostly in the area of Najran. The kingdom has offered the families of each slain soldier 1 million Saudi riyals, or about $267,000, to compensate for their loss.
</p><p>
Since the airstrikes began, Saudi Arabia boosted its troop numbers along the roughly 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) long border with Yemen. The troops frequently fire at suspected rebel positions with both cannon and mortar fire.
</p><p>
The area across the border is considered a Houthi stronghold. The Houthis managed to take several scattered Saudi villages in the southern border region of Jizan in 2009, during the kingdom's last war with the rebels.
</p><p>
Last week, during an AP trip to Saudi military positions in Jizan and Najran, the commander of Najran forces, Brig. Gen. Abdullah al-Shehri, said the border situation was stable. The war has so far not included a ground force operation in Yemen but al-Shehri said his forces were prepared for any eventuality.
</p><p>
Despite more than a month of airstrikes, the campaign has largely failed to halt the Houthis' advance on Aden.
</p><p>
But the Saudis say they have eliminated much of the stockpiles of missiles and heavy weapons that were allegedly under the control of Saleh's forces and his rebel allies. The kingdom says it has also succeeded in barring Iran from delivering more money and weapons to the Houthis.
</p><p>
Iran and the Houthis deny that Tehran has ever armed the rebels, but acknowledge humanitarian and political support from the Shiite nation.</p><p>

</p><p>
Federal prosecutors brought charges Friday against three former allies of Gov. Chris Christie — but not Christie himself — in the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal, easing the legal threat that has hung over his 2016 White House ambitions for more than a year.
</p><p>
One of those charged, David Wildstein, a former high-ranking official at the transportation agency that operates the bridge, pleaded guilty and accused the two other defendants of joining him in a politically motivated scheme to create huge traffic jams.
</p><p>
Christie was not publicly implicated in any wrongdoing, and appears to be in the clear for now.
</p><p>
"Based on the evidence currently available to us, we're not going to charge anyone else in this scheme," U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said at a news conference.
</p><p>
The Republican governor claimed vindication.
</p><p>
"Today's charges make clear that what I've said from day one is true — I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act," he said in a statement.
</p><p>
David Wildstein, a former high-ranking official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges, saying in court that he and the two other Christie loyalists closed lanes and engineered the gridlock in September 2013 as political payback against a Democratic mayor.
</p><p>
He also said the three of them concocted a cover story: It was all part of a traffic study.
</p><p>
Wildstein, 53, could face about two years in prison at sentencing Aug. 6.
</p><p>
The two people he implicated — former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, who was the governor's top appointee at the Port Authority — were charged in an indictment unsealed later in the day.
</p><p>
Essentially, all three defendants were accused of misusing public resources for political gain.
</p><p>
Wildstein gave no indication in court that Christie had any role in the scheme. But after the hearing, his lawyer, Alan Zegas, reiterated a claim he made last year that there's evidence that Christie knew about it as it happened. He did not go into detail.
</p><p>
While Christie appears to be out of legal danger, politically it could be more complicated.
</p><p>
Christie has been putting off for months a decision on whether to run for president in 2016. The charges bring attention back to the case just as the presidential cycle is getting underway and other candidates are getting into the race.
</p><p>
Also, even if he is not accused of a crime, the case serves as a reminder of the frequent criticism of Christie as a bully. Some of Christie's foes have suggested that even if he had no direct role in the plot, he created a culture that led members of his administration to think they could get away with such tactics.
</p><p>
Asked about that, Fishman said: "I won't comment on culture."
</p><p>
Kelly and Baroni are due in court Monday on charges including conspiracy, fraud and deprivation of civil rights. The charges carry a combined 86 years in prison, though any sentence would almost certainly be much shorter.
</p><p>
On Friday, Baroni's lawyer, Michael Baldassare, said that Baroni would be fully exonerated and that Wildstein is a habitual liar who told Baroni that the traffic jam was part of a legitimate traffic study. Kelly was planning a news conference later Friday.
</p><p>
The scandal broke wide open more than a year ago when an email from Kelly to Wildstein was revealed. It read, "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee." Wildstein's reply: "Got it." That exchange was key in the indictment.
</p><p>
The closing of two of three access lanes caused monumental, bumper-to-bumper tie-ups at the George Washington Bridge, one of the busiest spans in the nation, linking New Jersey with New York City. School buses and emergency vehicles were held up, and commuters were stuck in traffic for hours over four mornings.
</p><p>
Wildstein said they orchestrated the lane closings to start on the first day of school to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, a town at the foot of the bridge, for not endorsing Christie's re-election bid.
</p><p>
Christie, who coasted to re-election in the fall of 2013, has called the scheme "stupid" and ridiculed the notion that he was even interested in an endorsement from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich.
</p><p>
On Friday, Sokolich said that hearing the charges had been an emotional experience.
</p><p>
"I simply wasn't prepared for what I heard today. I just wasn't," he said. "It was a true punch in the gut."
</p><p>
By the time the incriminating email was made public, Wildstein had resigned, as had Baroni. The governor soon after fired Kelly and cut ties with Bill Stepien, his two-time campaign manager. Stepien was not indicted.</p><p>

It's an annoying problem for the unlucky few: the Apple Watch's heart rate monitor might not work if you have a tattoo on your wrist.
</p><p>
Inked and irked Apple fans have dubbed the issue "TattooGate" on Twitter, complaining that they must choose between their body art and their stylish gadget. Apple, for its part, acknowledged the issue on its support website.
</p><p>
"Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact heart rate sensor performance," the site reads. "The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult to get reliable readings."
</p><p>
While the issue might sound like one of those "1 percenter problems" some Twitter users wondered how it happened that Apple didn't have a single designer or tester with a wrist tattoo who would have noticed the problem. Apple suggests that users who can't get a consistent heart rate reading connect their Apple Watch wirelessly to external heart rate monitors.
</p><p>
If you have a wrist tattoo and aren't planning on removing it for the sake of the watch, it might make sense to test out the heart rate monitor feature before you commit to a watch.
</p><p>
This isn't Apple's first "-gate" problem. "Antennagate" in 2010 was a short-lived problem with the iPhone 4's antenna design, which caused reception problems when people covered a certain spot on the antenna with their bare hand.
</p><p>
Then-CEO Steve Jobs apologized to people who were not completely satisfied with the iPhone 4, but denied there was an antenna problem that needed fixing. Even so, the company gave out free protective cases. Even so, "Antennagate" didn't seem to make a dent in the iPhone's popularity or sour Apple's devoted fan base, and it's unlikely that "TattooGate" will make or break the Apple Watch.</p><p>

A few hundred May Day protesters decried racism, police brutality and economic issues during a march Friday from the Port of Oakland to City Hall.
</p><p>
Some of the demonstrators held signs reading "Racism is the Disease," ''Black Lives Matter" and "Stop Police Brutality." Others said they wanted better wages and working conditions for the masses.
</p><p>
The rally was mostly peaceful, the San Jose Mercury News reported (http://bayareane.ws/1bKjTF7 ). Some public buses were detoured to avoid other planned protests.
</p><p>
Maisha Davis, 29, a medical student at University of California, San Francisco is a member of White Coats for Black Lives.
</p><p>
"I'm here to support people for May Day," she told the newspaper. "Police brutality impacts us all."
</p><p>
Labor, immigrant and civil rights activists were expected to march in cities across California.
</p><p>
The annual May Day rallies have their roots in workers' rights, but events in recent years have been a rallying point for immigrant rights groups and other causes.
</p><p>
This year, use of force by police is a major focus following a series of incidents in which black men died in violent encounters with officers.
</p><p>
In Los Angeles, a series of planned events included a resource fair where legal services will be offered to immigrants outside City Hall. In San Francisco, labor activists planned to hold a march and rally at City Hall.
</p><p>
Activists in Anaheim marched for legislation allowing millions of immigrants in the country illegally to apply for permanent legal residence.
</p><p>
And in Riverside County, advocates were planning a march through Murrieta, which drew national attention last year when demonstrators blocked buses carrying Central American immigrant families trying to reach a Border Patrol facility for processing.</p><p>

        by The Associated Press
            More than one in four U.S. renters have to use at least half their family income to pay for housing and utilities.
</p><p>
That's the finding of an analysis of Census data by Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit that helps finance affordable housing. The number of such households has jumped 26 percent to 11.25 million since 2007.
</p><p>
Since the end of 2010, rental prices have surged at nearly twice the pace of average hourly wages, according to data from the real estate firm Zillow and the Labor Department.
</p><p>
"It means making really difficult trade-offs," said Angela Boyd, a vice president at Enterprise Community Partners. "There are daily financial dilemmas about making their rent or buying groceries."
</p><p>
The crisis reflects one of the shortcomings of the recovery from the Great Recession: Income has failed to match rent increases. At the same time, construction has failed to keep pace with demand from renters. The recession pushed more millennials, former homeowners who faced foreclosure and low-wage workers into rental housing.
</p><p>
A result is that 2.3 million more families face pressures that leave them perilously close to homelessness. It's a reality faced by Lisette Duarte, a 37-year-old living in a two-bedroom apartment with her family in northeast Los Angeles.
</p><p>
Duarte's husband lost his job as an electrician more than three years ago. With both their son and daughter on the autistic spectrum and in need of care, he chose to stay at home while she worked a job requiring a 90-minute commute each way. The lost income forced them out of a three-bedroom house and eventually into a hotel, where vouchers over the course of five months helped them save for a security deposit for an apartment.
</p><p>
About a year ago, the family moved into a two-bedroom apartment in the Highland Park neighborhood where Duarte had grown up. Two-bedrooms in that gentrifying community rent for an average of about $1,600 a month, according to the online service Apartment List. The expense, along with utilities, consumes half of Duarte's paycheck. The government defines housing costs in excess of 30 percent of income as burdensome.
</p><p>
The family relies on prepaid cellphones. They don't dine out or go on vacations. Whatever extra income they have often goes for health care.
</p><p>
More than 30 percent of renters in California, Florida, New Jersey and New York state devote at least half their incomes to housing and utilities, according to the analysis. Other than Alaska, South Dakota and Wyoming, at least 20 percent of renters in every state face similarly high costs relative to income.
</p><p>
The analysis was developed for a "Make Room" awareness campaign sponsored by Enterprise Community Partners. As part of the campaign, pop stars such as Carly Rae Jepsen of "Call Me Maybe" fame, who sang for the Duartes, are performing concerts in the homes of financially distressed tenants.
</p><p>
Enterprise Community Partners' analysis dovetails with findings from other organizations. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has estimated that 12 million renters and homeowners spend at least 50 percent of their income on housing.
</p><p>
And Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found in a 2013 report that roughly 27 percent of renters were devoting half their incomes to rent. Those levels were "unimaginable just a decade ago," the report said.
</p><p>
Average hourly wages have risen just 2.1 percent in the past 12 months, according to the Labor Department, while rental prices have climbed 3.7 percent, Zillow said last week.
</p><p>
Many renters lack the income to pay the cost of maintaining and operating these buildings, said Barry Zigas, director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America and a trustee at the nonprofit Mercy Housing.
</p><p>
Mercy Housing has a portfolio of 12,000 units for low-income people and senior citizens. It costs an average of roughly $500 a month to manage each unit, Zigas said. A monthly rent of $500 would mean that anyone working full time for a minimum wage would devote more than a third of his or her income to housing.
</p><p>
Either the tenants must fork over a greater share of their pay each year or landlords may let buildings fall into disrepair.
</p><p>
"Low-income renters are getting caught in a total squeeze play, as are the owners of the properties," Zigas said.
</p><p>
The Great Recession caused waves of foreclosures and layoffs that pushed more Americans into renting. More than 36 percent of people now rent, compared with 31 percent before the recession began in late 2007. The increased demand has yet to be matched by construction and renovations.
</p><p>
In March, the National Low Income Housing Coalition reported a shortage of 7.1 million apartments for low-income renters. The shortages are most pronounced in Nevada, California, Arizona, Oregon, Florida, Colorado and Utah.
</p><p>
Construction firms are building apartment complexes at an annual pace of roughly 321,333 this year, according to the Commerce Department. The rising rental prices suggest that construction hasn't kept pace with demand, according to economists.
</p><p>
For renters such as Duarte, the plan is that her husband can eventually return to work as their children reach adulthood, easing some of their financial pressures.
</p><p>

        by The Associated Press
            </p><p>Rage turned to relief in Baltimore on Friday when the city's top prosecutor charged six police officers with felonies ranging from assault to murder in the death of Freddie Gray. Authorities also released the officers' names and mugshots.
</p><p>
State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Gray's arrest was illegal and unjustified, and that his neck was broken because he was handcuffed, shackled and placed head-first into a police van, where his pleas for medical attention were repeatedly ignored as he bounced around inside the small metal box.
</p><p>
The swiftness of her announcement, less than a day after receiving the police department's criminal investigation and official autopsy results, took the city by surprise. So too did her detailed description, based in part on her office's independent investigation, of the evidence supporting probable cause to charge all six officers with felonies.
</p><p>
The police had no reason to stop or chase after Gray, Mosby said. They falsely accused him of having an illegal switchblade when in fact it was a legal pocketknife. The van driver and the other officers failed to strap him down with a seatbelt, a direct violation of department policy, and they ignored Gray's repeated pleas for medical attention, even rerouting the van to pick up another passenger.
</p><p>
Mosby did not say whether there was any indication the driver deliberately drove erratically, causing Gray's body to strike the van's interior. In 2005, a man died of a fractured spine after he was transported in a Baltimore police van in handcuffs and without a seat belt. At a civil trial, an attorney for his family successfully argued police had given him a "rough ride."
</p><p>
The officers missed five opportunities to help an injured and falsely imprisoned detainee before he arrived at the police station no longer breathing, she said. Along the way, "Mr. Gray suffered a severe and critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside of the BPD wagon," she concluded.
</p><p>
Her announcement triggered celebrations across the same West Baltimore streets that were smoldering just four days earlier, when Gray's funeral led to riots and looting.
</p><p>
"We are satisfied with today's charges," Gray's stepfather, Richard Shipley, told a news conference. "These charges are an important step in getting justice for Freddie."
</p><p>
But a lawyer hired by the police union insisted the officers did nothing wrong. Attorney Michael Davey said Friday that Mosby has committed "an egregious rush to judgment."
</p><p>
"We have grave concerns about the fairness and integrity of the prosecution of our officers," Davey said.
</p><p>
Mosby rejected a police union request to step aside and appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case, and said honorable police officers should have no problem working with prosecutors in Baltimore.
</p><p>
Other law enforcement veterans worried that the charges could have a chilling effect. Robert Leight, a former detective in Pennsylvania who has worked for the FBI and as a federal prosecutor and defense attorney, said "the biggest danger is that the police officer will not properly perform his duties."
</p><p>
"It puts him at risk, it puts the other officers around him at risk, and it puts the public at risk," Leight said. "A police officer must react instinctively as he has been trained. If a police officer first thinks about what liabilities he will be facing, it's too late."
</p><p>
Gray was stopped by police in Sandtown, a poor, overwhelmingly African-American neighborhood in West Baltimore. He locked eyes with a police officer and then ran. Two blocks later, they pinned him to the sidewalk, handcuffed him and dragged him into a transport van, a scene captured on bystander's cellphone video and shown around the world.
</p><p>
Mosby said the police review, the autopsy and her own office's investigation all point to homicide. The officers were booked Friday on charges ranging from assault and manslaughter, carrying 10-year prison sentences, to second-degree "depraved heart" murder, which could put the van driver in prison for 30 years if convicted.
</p><p>
In a city that struggles daily with pervasive poverty and widespread joblessness, failing schools, drug addiction, a crumbling infrastructure and corruption, Gray's death has become emblematic of the broad social and economic problems holding Baltimore down.
</p><p>
But unlike other major cities grappling with police killings, Baltimore's mayor, state's attorney and police commissioner are black, like the majority of the city's population.
</p><p>
Three of the officers charged in the case, including the van driver, are also black, according to online court records. The other three are listed as belonging to the broad category of "White, Caucasian, Asiatic Indian, Arab," without further elaboration.
</p><p>
The city, which has been on edge since Gray's death on April 19, remains under a nighttime curfew, with 2,000 National Guard troops augmenting police reinforcements from around the state of Maryland. Malik Shabazz, the president of Black Lawyers for Justice, says Saturday's protest march will now be a "victory rally," and said Mosby is "setting a standard for prosecutors all over the nation."
</p><p>
At City Hall, Andrea Otom, 41, sobbed with something like joy.
</p><p>
"You have to be able to expect that at some time, the pendulum will swing in your favor, and in the black community we've seen it over and over and over where it doesn't," Otom said. "I'm so happy to see a day where the pendulum has finally begun to swing."
</p><p>
U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from West Baltimore, not far from where Gray was raised and arrested, said the neighborhood and others like it "have never seen a victory."
</p><p>
"So many felt like the system had worked against them," Cummings said Friday. "As we approach the evening of our lives, we want to make sure our children have a better morning."
</p><p>
In an impassioned statement delivered shortly after the charges were made public, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake warned that police misconduct will not be tolerated on her watch.
</p><p>
"To those of you who wish to engage in brutality, misconduct, racism and corruption, let me be clear," she said, "there is no place in the Baltimore City Police Department for you."
</p><p>
Rashawn Ray, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, said the murder and manslaughter charges in Gray's death shape a debate that goes much deeper than legal limits on use of force by police officers. It has triggered the frustration, anger and hopelessness of generations of disenfranchised people in Baltimore's most marginalized neighborhoods, he said.
</p><p>
"This definitely seems like the first time in recent history that the state has done what the community feels is the right thing," Ray said. "These charges become a representation of culpability, responsibility, that the state can't just treat citizens like they are not human beings."
</p><p>
"It's symbolic not just of police brutality," Ray said. "Maybe we are progressing toward the equality that we should have been moving toward decades ago."</p><p>

            He’s easy to like, a competitor who wants your best against his best. Billy Horschel is friendly and open. He’s just as easy to dislike.<p></p>
“Yeah,” he says flat out, “I think you’ve got to be cocky.”<p></p>
In his youth — Horschel now is 28 — that attitude absolutely frosted a sweet, Irish lad named Rory McIlroy, who wasn’t sure if he wanted to use a driver to outplay Horschel or to whack Billy over the head.<p></p>
“It was pretty heated,” McIlroy agreed.<p></p>
That was in 2007, when each was an amateur in the Walker Cup matches at Royal County Down, not too many miles from McIlroy’s home in Northern Ireland. “Back then,” McIlroy said, “we were a little bit younger and a little more emotional.”<p></p>
Time and maturity have soothed feelings. “We’re good mates,” McIlroy insisted now. Yet the history is very much a part of today’s meeting between McIlroy and Horschel in the World Golf Championship Cadillac Match Play Championship at TPC Harding Park.<p></p>
One of them is going to emerge from their round-robin pod of four — the so-called Group of Death, as borrowed from soccer’s World Cup — to make it to Saturday, when knockout play starts. The other is going to head to San Francisco International Airport for a flight to, well, if it’s McIlroy to Las Vegas for the Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather fight and maybe back again for Sunday play. If he gets that far.<p></p>
“If you don’t win,” McIlroy said, “you go home. So it’s do or die [today] and looking forward to it.”<p></p>
No more than Horschel.<p></p>
“Looking forward to playing McIlroy, the No. 1 player in the world,” Horschel said, “and see what happens. Obviously we have a track record against each other.”<p></p>
Horschel and the 25-year-old McIlroy each won his second-day match Thursday, Horschel thumping former PGA champ Jason Duffner 3 and 2 and McIlroy defeating Brandt Snedeker 2 up. Duffner and Snedeker both are 0-2, punching bags without any opportunity to advance, but they’ll play each other, anyway.<p></p>
The anticipation has been for a final Sunday afternoon between McIlroy, the British Open and PGA champion, and Jordan Spieth, who won the Masters so impressively a couple weeks back he made to the cover of Sports Illustrated, which never puts golfers out there unless they’re named Rory or Tiger.<p></p>
That matchup still is possible, Spieth beating Matt Every 4 and 3 to remain unbeaten after two matches in his pod. It certainly isn’t inevitable.<p></p>
“You’ve got to be confident,” Horschel reiterated. “You’ve got to be cocky. Sometimes you’re not going to be the favorite in that match. But you’ve got to have so much confidence to the point it’s bordering on cockiness and arrogance when you go up against certain players. And I’m not afraid to show that.”<p></p>
Bubba Watson and Louis Oosthuizen are undefeated in their pod and will face each other. Already eliminated from the knockout round, but still playing in with today’s’ round-robin are Keegan Bradley and Adam Scott, major winners, and Jason Day, last year’s match-play champion.<p></p>
Hunter Mahan, the 2012 champion, defeated Ben Martin 5 and 3 and is the only one in his group without a loss. “Still got to win,” Mahan said.<p></p>
Mahan said he wasn’t happy the match play will move to Austin, Texas, next year. “It’s a bummer to leave San Fran,” he said. “One of my favorite cities. Great golf town. Great golf courses.”<p></p>
And this week some very great golfers.<p></p>
“What Jordan did is unbelievable,” Horschel said. “Twenty-one years old and win the Masters. I would never have thought of that when I was 21.<p></p>
“If they want to say, obviously right now, Rory and Jordan Spieth are the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the world, and a rivalry, sure,” Horschel said. “But there’s too many good young players in this game.”<p></p>
And Billy Horschel agrees he’s one of them.<p></p>

            <b>OAKLAND —</b> The Memphis Grizzlies are known in NBA circles for their ability to pound out wins, with a style (Grind-and-Grind), a home arena (FedEx Forum, aka The Grindhouse) and a shooting guard-folk hero (Tony “Grindfather” Allen) who is named in honor of their physical style.<p></p>
The Warriors will find out firsthand what’s behind those names at Oracle Arena on Sunday in the first playoff meeting ever between the franchises. They’ll have a chance to shift yet another leaguewide perception in a season full of firsts — that their roster isn’t rugged enough to seriously contend for a championship.<p></p>
“I don’t think anyone on our team is known for being tough or physical because we score so many points,” Warriors center Andrew Bogut said. “And that’s the way we like it.<p></p>
“Everyone thinks, ‘It’s going be a run-and-gun game, the Warriors are going to score 110. It’s going to be a free-flowing, 3-point game.’ And they forget we’re No. 1 defensively for a reason. We still don’t get that attention, and I think it’s a good thing, actually. We surprise a lot of teams with that.”<p></p>
It’s not a surprise, however, that much of the talk leading up to the Western Conference semifinals opener at Oracle Arena will likely center around the team’s contrasting styles — call it Grind versus Gun — and the potential duel down low between Bogut and Draymond Green and the Grizzlies’ Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph.<p></p>
Indeed, the 7-foot Bogut, who acknowledged Gasol’s place among the NBA’s best centers and Randolph as “one of the smartest players in the league,” proved himself integral after sitting out of the first regular-season meeting, which the Warriors lost at home 105-98 on Dec. 16.<p></p>
In the next two meetings, though, Warriors star Stephen Curry went for 38 points (his fourth-highest total of the season) in a 107-84 blowout win March 27 at Memphis, to which Klay Thompson countered by pouring in 42 (37 in the second half) in a 111-107 victory, setting the regular-season record for most points in one half against the Grizzlies.<p></p>
“You want to go into a playoff series having felt some success,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “You also don’t want to use that for anything that it’s not. ... But it’s the playoffs. They’re going to be fresher. They’re going to be more alert defensively just like we will, hopefully.So we should not go into this game by any means thinking, ‘Oh, we just won the last two against Memphis in the last month. We’re fine.’ It doesn’t work that way.”<p></p>
What does matter more, perhaps, is the fluid Warriors’ offensive system installed this season by Kerr and associate coach Alvin Gentry, and the team’s ability to stay true to its ball-movement principles.<p></p>
“We got to run and keep our tempo,” Bogut said. “The last couple years, we ran a lot of isolation stuff, and that plays right into Memphis’ hands. If you keep the ball on one side of the court, that’s what they’re all about. When we can swing the ball side to side and get their big guys in the pick and roll and move the ball, I think that’s a big reason why [our offense had success this season]."
The Grizzlies, meanwhile, will presumably look to slow the game down, and according to Bogut, “keep scores in the 70s, 80s and 90s,” which would make even more sense given point guard Mike Conley’s uncertain status. He suffered a facial fracture in a Game 3 victory at Portland last Saturday and subsequently received two metal plates in his face.<p></p>
Guards Beno Udrih and Nick Calathes are expected to get the lion’s share of the minutes in trying to replace the 27-year-old Ohio State product’s career postseason averages of 15.8 points and 6.8 assists a game — though Bogut wouldn’t rule out the unexpected.<p></p>
“I’m not ruling [Conley] out until I don’t see him on the court in Game 1,” Bogut said. “He’s got a week to prepare. And those pills these days do wonderful things. We’re preparing like he’s playing. You never know what’s going to happen. They could give him an Iron Man mask — who knows?”

            Say a pray for Beno Udrih tonight, won’t you?<p></p>
The Memphis Grizzlies will limp into Oracle Arena on Sunday without Mike Conley in uniform, presumably, which leaves them with zero chance to beat the Warriors in Game 1 of their playoff series. Conley and Tony Allen would have been a test for Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in the backcourt, but Conley’s absence changes that considerably. The 6-foot-4 Allen is a better match against Thompson at off guard, which leaves the 32-year-old Udrih as the main cover on Curry, and he can’t stop a sneeze let alone the best shotmaker in the game.<p></p>
Even with Conley in the lineup, the Warriors won the regular season series 2-1 and Andrew Bogut didn’t play in the game they lost.<p></p>
“He’s up there,” Curry told Balls on Thursday when asked where Conley ranked defensively at his position. “He’s just crafty. He’s never out of a play. He’s got quick hands, and it seem like he never makes a mental mistake on that end of the floor. That’s what good defenders do.”<p></p>
Other than Marc Gasol, perhaps, Conley is the guy the Grizzlies can least afford to lose right now.<p></p>
“A great player,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr called him. “I think he’s an All-Star. Obviously, his absence is a big deal. I mean, if we lost Steph, it would be a big deal. [His absence] is similar in terms of the impact he makes as a point guard.”<p></p>
On Monday, Conley had two plates and screws installed in his face to repair a fracture near his left eye, the result of an errant elbow last weekend. Typically, the injury requires four-to-six weeks to heal properly. He also has played on a bum foot in recent weeks.<p></p>
Conley insists he’ll play in the series at some point, but he better hurry. This one has “Sweep!” written all over it.<p></p>

<b>HE’S BACK:</b> Maybe general manager Trent Baalke didn’t appease some 49ers fans with his dice roll on Arik Armstead in the first round of the NFL Draft on Thursday. But he did please the draftniks who had pegged the defensive end correctly in their mock drafts weeks earlier.<p></p>
The biggest addition might have come earlier in the week, when linebacker NaVorro Bowman took part in a voluntary minicamp at Levi’s Stadium. It was his first action since he suffered a gruesome left knee injury in the 2014 NFC Championship Game.  <p></p>
I’m excited, man,” Bowman said. “There’s still a lot of work to do, but my knee’s feeling great.”<p></p>
Whether or not Bowman will be the same player again won’t be known until the preseason. But for a defense that’s short on playmakers, his return is a welcomed sight, indeed.<p></p>

<b>ROB THE MAN:</b> The average time of a Major League Baseball game dropped 8½ minutes in the first month of the season, the largest decrease in 52 years.<p></p>
Which means Commissioner Rob Manfred has accomplished almost as much in three months as Bud Selig did in the previous 17 years.<p></p>

<b>THE LIST:</b> Items left on Manfred’s to-do list:<p></p>
1. Adopt some form of salary cap with a floor and a ceiling.<p></p>
2. Dump the designated hitter in the American League.<p></p>
3. Have every team play one doubleheader each month, begin the postseason one week earlier.<p></p>
4. Move the Kansas City Royals to the World Wrestling Entertainment, bring back the Montreal Expos.<p></p>

            <b>SANTA CLARA —</b> Niners general manager Trent Baalke is known for holding on to draft secrets as if they were made out of gold, but he might as well have tweeted his first-round plan this year.<p></p>
Most mock NFL drafts had the 49ers taking Oregon defensive end Arik Armstead in the first round, and that’s exactly what they did Thursday. But it wasn’t before Baalke completed the first deal of the draft, in which he traded down two spots with San Diego, from 15th to 17th, and pocketed a fourth-rounder this year and a fifth-rounder in 2016 in return.<p></p>
“I needed to appease the media, so I made the pick,” Baalke joked. “It really worked to our favor this year because in some respects, I would think for the last few years everyone we were associated with we never picked. So now this year we were associated with this young man and we picked him.”<p></p>
Barring additional moves, the team will have nine more picks in the final six rounds. Cornerback and wide receiver remain high on its want list. 
Last week, NFL Network draft analyst Mike Mayock called the 6-foot-7, 292-pound Armstead “a perfect fit” for what the 49ers need in their 3-4 defense.<p></p>
The 49ers definitely need reinforcements on their defensive line, even if Baalke and coach Jim Tomsula say they have tremendous depth at the position. Starting left defensive end Ray McDonald was released after yet another off-field incident. Starting right end Justin Smith is contemplating retirement and will likely play only one more season if he does return.
Armstead, who grew up in Sacramento, played defensive end in a 3-4 defense in college.<p></p>
“Just learning a little bit about their defense, we run a similar scheme up at Oregon, a 3-4 scheme,” Armstead said during a conference call from his family’s home in Sacramento. “I think my skill set in the 3-4 is perfect. I picked up the defense real easy when I learned it, and I feel like I have the athleticism to play the end position in their defense.”<p></p>
Armstead had only 2½ sacks last season as a junior, which was a red flag for some draft analysts. But he said the scheme called on him do to more than just sack the quarterback.<p></p>
“My role was to be disruptive, take on blockers, free up guys at times,” Armstead said. “My role was to do whatever my coaches asked of me and I played my position well. I feel at Oregon I did what my coaches asked of me. I put my health on the line for them playing injured.”<p></p>
Armstead also played basketball at Oregon his first two seasons before concentrating on football in his junior season. Some analysts, pointing to his time as a two-sport athlete, believe he is still a raw but gifted football player.<p></p>
“I don’t think I’m raw,” Armstead said. “I think if people watch film of me they’ll see a technical, sound player. I think I have a lot of room to grow and a lot of things to improve on, but I’m looking forward to doing that with the coaching staff here.”<p></p>
In the 49ers’ defensive system, linemen have to be big, powerful and quick enough to control two gaps along the line of scrimmage. Baalke said there are usually only a handful of draft-worthy players each year who are physically capable of handling that job.<p></p>
“They’re hard to find,” Baalke said. “You need those guys to play the type of defense we play. How many 6-7, 290-pound men do they make? There just aren’t that many.”<p></p>
Baalke and Tomsula said there’s no pressure on Armstead to fill a hole and start immediately as a rookie. Armstead will have time to get into the weight room, something that basketball interfered with at times, and master the techniques he’ll need to thrive in a new system.<p></p>
“There’s going to be some development in the process,” Baalke said, “but we’re well aware of it.”<p></p>
Baalke said he had a “Plan B” in case Armstead was chosen before the No. 17 pick.<p></p>
“You never move back unless you have an alternate plan in mind,” Baalke said. “Arik was the one we were coveting at that pick.”<p></p>
San Diego took Wisconsin running back Melvin Gordon at No. 15, and Houston chose Wake Forest cornerback Kevin Johnson at No. 16. That left Armstead for the 49ers, and he said he can’t wait to get started and learn some techniques to help him pressure quarterbacks.<p></p>
“Get around some talented minds, coaching minds who are going to push me to the next level and teach me those key things and technique things to make me successful,” Armstead said of his immediate plans.<p></p>
“I’m going in there open-minded, looking to work hard and be coachable.”

            <b>OAKLAND —</b> Kole Calhoun had two hits and three RBIs, Garrett Richards took a shutout into the seventh inning, and the Los Angeles Angels held on to beat the Oakland Athletics 6-5 Thursday.<p></p>

Erick Aybar, Johnny Giavotella and David Freese also drove in runs for the Angels, who have won five of seven to end April with a .500 record (11-11).<p></p>

Mark Canha drove in three runs, two on a homer, as the A's lost for the sixth time in seven games, matching their worst start in Oakland history at 9-14.<p></p>

Richards, making his third start after opening the season on the disabled list, was pulled after Josh Reddick singled to open the seventh, and was charged with a run after Canha's home run off Mike Morin.<p></p>

Richards (2-1) gave up four hits, walked three and struck out five.<p></p>

Vinnie Pestano started the ninth by walking Billy Butler and giving up a single to Reddick. Huston Street came on and gave up run-scoring singles to Brett Lawrie and Canha. He walked pinch-hitter Stephen Vogt to load the bases before getting pinch-hitter Max Muncy on a pop up.<p></p>

Sam Fuld followed with another RBI single. Street, who allowed his first runs of the year, got Marcus Semien on a popup before Ike Davis hit a ball to deep center that Mike Trout caught before hitting the wall to give the closer his ninth save.<p></p>

Jesse Chavez (0-2) lasted five innings for the A's. He allowed four runs on seven hits, walking three and striking out five.<p></p>

Calhoun, batting cleanup in the absence of Albert Pujols, drove in two runs in the fifth after Trout, who added two hits and was on base four times, was walked intentionally.<p></p>

Calhoun improved to .438 hitter (7 for 16), with seven RBIs, in eight games batting fourth.<p></p>

<b>TRAINER'S ROOM</b><p></p>

Angels: Pujols was out of the lineup with a sore hamstring suffered late in Wednesday night's victory over the A's. Manager Mike Scioscia said the team would re-evaluate him daily.<p></p>

Athletics: LHP Sean Doolittle (strained left rotator cuff) threw 25 pitches and felt fine. He will throw another bullpen on Sunday. ... RHP Jarrod Parker (Tommy John surgery) is scheduled to make his next rehab start with Triple-A Nashville. ... Canha returned to the lineup after missing a few days with an illness.<p></p>

<b>PITCHING RECORD CHANGE</b><p></p>

RHP Mike Morin (1-0), who struck out the only batter he faced, became the official winning pitcher of Wednesday night's 6-3 victory over the A's. The victory was incorrectly awarded to RHP Fernando Salas, who threw a scoreless inning after taking over for Morin. Salas (0-1) does get credit for a hold.<p></p>

<b>UP NEXT</b><p></p>

<b>Angels:</b> LHP C.J. Wilson (1-2, 3.12) starts Friday night's game at San Francisco. He's 9-7 with seven saves in 50 career interleague games, including 20 starts. He beat the Giants in his only previous start against them, in 2012.<p></p>

<b>Athletics:</b> LHP Scott Kazmir (2-0, 0.99) opens the series against the Rangers in Texas on Friday night. Opponents are batting .051 against him with runners on base. His 10 wins against the Rangers match his most against any team.<p></p>

            Prettiness eclipses passion in "Far From the Madding Crowd," a new version of Thomas Hardy's novel about a farm woman and her three suitors. Still, the movie is an enjoyable, absorbing literary adaptation and romantic drama, thanks to a captivating heroine and a vibrant central performance.</p><p>
Directed by Thomas Vinterberg ("A Celebration") and scripted by David Nicholls, the film is a relatively faithful but overly streamlined adaptation of the 1874 novel, which is one of the sunniest works written by Hardy, whose name is synonymous with stories of crushing hardships and twists of fate.</p><p>
Carey Mulligan plays Victorian-age country girl Bathsheba Everdene, whose independent spirit catches the eye of sturdily named and bodied shepherd Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts) in hilly Dorset, England. Gabriel presents Bathsheba with a cute little lamb and a marriage proposal, which she turns down. </p><p>
Reversals of fortune occur. Bathsheba inherits a farm. Gabriel loses his sheep and begins working for Bathsheba and remains devoted to her.</p><p>
Meanwhile, Bathsheba, a capable, decent farm owner, also can be childish and thoughtless. An impetuous decision to send a valentine to wealthy, repressed middle-aged farmer Mr. Boldwood (Michael Sheen) causes him to mistakenly believe she desires him. He pursues her, and she considers marrying him, but her indecision and rival suitors cause him "terrible grief."</p><p>
Those rivals include Frank Troy (Tom Sturridge), a dashing but caddish soldier who, in fact, loves tragic servant girl Fanny (Juno Temple). Frank seduces Bathsheba with some erotic swordplay. Before long, the two are married and Frank is gambling away the money. Later, multiple passions collide at a Christmas party at Boldwood's mansion.</p><p>
While on a par with director John Schlesinger's 1967 rendition of Hardy's novel, Vinterberg's shorter, more intimate version suffers from significant cuts made to the original story. A memorable passage in which the vanished Frank appears, disguised, at a fair, is noticeably absent. A lack of buildup undermines the credibility of Boldwood's climactic act.</p><p>
And the film often gets too caught up in its pastoral beauty, at the expense of the emotional charge the story demands.</p><p>
Still, Vinterberg's light but serious touch, Hardy's enduring material and Mulligan's performance give rise to an old-fashioned, eye-pleasing, big-screen romance that is at once filling and friendly.</p><p>
Less ethereal and flirty than Julie Christie's Bathsheba, Mulligan anchors the film and stirs the viewer with her contradiction-filled, flesh-and-blood, dynamic portrait of a norm-busting Hardy heroine. And for anyone wondering: Yes, Bathsheba Everdene was a partial influence for Hunger Games heroine Katniss Everdeen.</p><p>

        by Jeffrey M. Anderson
            Joss Whedon's highly anticipated "Avengers: Age of Ultron" boasts perhaps the biggest bunch of superheroes yet.</p><p>
And Whedon is excellent at illustrating the conundrum central to superhero moves, exploiting what makes them so popular to the masses: In everyday life, we're awkward and uncertain, but each of us just might have some kind of secret power that helps us feel stronger. The drama of the best superhero stories stems from the notion that these sides are always in conflict.</p><p>
In addition, Whedon is highly skilled at creating ensemble pieces, and giving each character weight. He also writes good dialogue, creates smart, striking action scenes and keeps up the pace.</p><p>
In short, he's a super-juggler. But on “Age of Ultron,” he seems to have lost control of some of the balls. The new movie succeeds, but falls short of his incredible achievement on 2012’s "The Avengers." </p><p>
“Ultron" begins with our team — Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) — retrieving part of Loki's scepter and battling super-powered twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen).</p><p>
Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (aka Hulk) decide to use the scepter to build artificial intelligence that can help protect the earth. That doesn’t happen. Instead, Ultron (James Spader), a megalomaniacal robot that wants to save the world by destroying it, enters the scene.  </p><p>
Although “Ultron” has huge, slam-bang battles – in which cars, bridges and buildings are destroyed and chunks of rock and metal are flung far and wide – its best parts are when the characters face their own emotional foibles. For example, Scarlet Witch has the power to make people experience their own worst fears like a nightmare; for awhile, that shakes up the heroes. </p><p>
The movie also plays with themes of connections and bonds, such as twin siblings, a secret family, and even the sweet beginnings of a crush between two heroes.
Whedon is good at portraying small moments, showing the characters flirting and  messing around. And his running jokes about bad language and lifting Thor's hammer are delightful.</p><p>
But no mortal man can be in charge of this many superheroes and not lose focus. The characters’ interactions begin to feel timed rather than natural, and battles fall out of rhythm.</p><p>
Still, it’s not a total loss. Whedon, who brings his own personality to "Avengers: Age of Ultron,” clearly cares, and he’s made a movie worth watching. </p><p>

            <p>Hell hath no fury like a tattoo artist scorned. Especially if that scorn involves the hashtags "#RIPvaginatattoo" and "#kidsdontdodrugs."</p>

<p>Singer Demi Lovato sparked an ugly online spat this month by posting a picture of a new rose tattoo on her arm. The spat was almost as ugly as the tattoo the rose was covering up: misshapen lips with an uncanny resemblance to the works of Georgia O'Keeffe, hence Lovato's use of aforementioned hashtags.</p>

<p>"Thanks for getting the tattoo covered up I did for free that you specifically asked for," tattoo artist Ashley McMullen tweeted afterward. She accused the former child star of being drunk and urinating on a toilet seat during the session, adding, "The tattoo you covered it with kinda sucks too."</p>

<p>At first Lovato, 22, took the high road by responding with a string of emoticons absolutely incomprehensible to anyone born before the Clinton administration. On Thursday, though, she lashed out on Twitter.</p>

<p>Lovato, who has been open about her struggles with substance abuse,  criticized McMullen for "admitting to the fact that you tattooed a very intoxicated 18 year old on a tour bus without the proper judgement that most legit tattoo artists have."</p>

<p>Lovato concluded with another string of icons that was presumably quite devastating.</p>

<p><b>NEPAL QUAKE AFFECTS 'SAN ANDREAS'</b></p>

<p>A powerful earthquake in Nepal that killed more than 5,000 on Saturday is causing some rumbles in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. almost postponed the May 29 release date for "San Andreas," a disaster flick in which a massive temblor pummels San Francisco and Los Angeles, before deciding this week to tweak the marketing campaign instead.</p>

<p>"We will continue to evaluate our worldwide marketing campaign to ensure that we are sensitive to those affected by this tragic event," a studio spokesman told Variety.</p>

<p>"San Andreas," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Carla Gugino, shot scenes in San Francisco in July, including at AT&T Park and Fisherman's Wharf.</p>

<p><b>QUICK TAKES</b></p>

<p>The murder trial against hip-hop mogul Suge Knight has been scheduled to begin July 7. ... Britney Spears has canceled two shows after twisting her ankle during a performance in Las Vegas on Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY</b></p>

<p>Actor Jamie Dornan ("Fifty Shades of Grey") is 33. ... Director Wes Anderson ("The Grand Budapest Hotel") is 46. ... Country singer Tim McGraw is 48. ... Actress Joanna Lumley ("Absolutely Fabulous") is 69. ... Singer Judy Collins is 76.</p>
