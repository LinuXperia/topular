The proposal has a short life span if it isn't acted on quickly, as the council will only have one more full meeting this calendar year. And any measure that doesn't make it out of the full council by the end of the year dies as the term of this council ends on January 1, 2016. According to IndyPolitics, outgoing Mayor Greg Ballard declined to say if he supported it or not, saying he hasn't seen the specifics of the proposal.<br /><br /><a href="http://fox59.com/2015/11/30/hogsett-city-council-members-could-see-major-pay-raises-for-2016/">Several news reports have mentioned that councils and/or mayors in other Indiana cities, or cities in neighboring states, have much higher salaries</a>. In fact, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/10/20/7-ways-carmel-spend-money-2016/74064178/">Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard and the Carmel City-Council voted raises for most city employees themselves and Brainard earlier this year</a>. Carmel's elected officials voted on those raises as part of the city's budget, after the 2015 Republican primary in May, which is the de facto election in Carmel and most of Hamilton County.<br /><br />Social media commentary on local news' Facebook pages have been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy/posts/10156362366305360">almost universally negative on this action</a>.<br /><br />So what do I think?<br /><br />I think the salaries for mayors and councils across the state have a huge pay gap. And I honestly don't see why. I wonder if one party control in some of these cities (particularly Carmel, Westfield, and Gary) might make it easier to slip these pay increases in. Many of these communities have been one party control for decades, but it is only within the last 10 years that Democrats have really had the same kind of success that they've long had in Gary, or Republicans have had in Carmel.<br /><br />I think proposing this after an election, where this wasn't an issue that was talked about publicly, reeks of backroom deals. I suspect that this has been talked about in caucuses and informal meetings for quite some time.<br /><br />I think putting this before a lame duck council, with several members not returning, and a lame duck mayor, is attempting to circumvent political backlash, hoping that people won't remember or won't care in four years.<br /><br />I honestly don't have a problem with council raises. A good councilor does a lot of work. Some treat it as a full time or nearly full time job in addition to their actual full time job and other responsibilities. The ones doing the hard work, I have much less of a problem giving it to them. The do-nothings, I have more of an issue with.<br /><br />As for the Mayor, I think the perks more than make up for whatever salary he doesn't get.<br /><br />Ideally, I'd like to completely revamp our legislative body. I think we're a big city and we should have a big-boy, full time council. Cut it down to 11 or 13 members, give them a decent salary, make it their full time job. Put restrictions on other work they can do so conflicts of interest don't arise. &nbsp;Microsoft's Board of Directors is only 10 people so there's no reason we need 25 cooks in the kitchen.<br /><br />Failing that, I really think the Indiana state legislature and look at the disparity in pay between city and county councils and Mayors of cities and towns and take the politics out of it. Establish a salary for elected officials based on the type of city (class 1, etc...) or county, set the salary, index it to inflation. I really can't think of a good reason the Mayor of Gary or Westfield should be paid more than the Mayor of Indianapolis. I'd like similar rules to be established for the county wide offices, but many of those offices might be supported by specific fees they charge and the fees collected in a more populated county will obviously be more than in a more rural county.<br /><br /><br />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/12/municipal-money-and-salaries.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-12-02T08:00:01.066-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-6259876633239858704";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 12:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"State of Indiana; Indiana State Park; Department of Natural Resources";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"Indiana: Where Our State Parks Aren&#039;t Free And Don&#039;t Have Trash Cans";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1540:"A friend of mine recently moved to Indianapolis and overall has enjoyed her time in the city. But her top gripe is that the closest state park, Fort Harrison State Park, <a href="http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/2982.htm">charges admission or requires an annual membership</a>.<br /><br />We took my dog, <a href="http://twitter.com/questthedog">Quest</a>, out on a hike through the park today. Along the way we noticed several signs saying dogs must be on a leash at all times and that owners must clean up after their dog. As a good citizen, I did so when my dog made a mess.<br /><br />As our hike ended and we returned to the parking lot, we looked for a trash can and found none. There are several picnic tables, and even picnic areas presumably meant for large gatherings. But not a single trash can was around.

The program will launch in some of its more diverse and low-income areas, including South LA and Koreatown. The pilot intends to add a fleet of 100 cars, with residents being able to sign up and pay a monthly membership or pay on a per-hour basis. While exact rates are still being worked out, officials are saying they hope it to be lower priced than car sharing services such as Uber and Lyft.<br /><br />For reference, Los Angele's base uber fee is $0 bae, $.18 per minute, and $1 per mile. Indianapolis' Uber fares are $1.25 base, $.18 per minute, and $.95 per mile.<br /><br />While the report doesn't specifically say what type of electric car&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;that LA already has, I'm going to guess the answer is little to none. You can see some shots of charging stations being constructed in the background if you watch the news report clip on NBC-LA's web site. All in all, this works out to about $16,000 per car.<br /><br />In contrast, the&nbsp;electric&nbsp;car sharing program BlueIndy is costing nearly <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/04/28/city-reaches-deal-blueindy-electric-car-share-service/26515019/">$50 million for 500 cars</a>. That cost likely doesn't take into account the millions of dollars of lost revenue when <s>Dictator</s> Mayor Greg Ballard (R) unilaterally removes hundreds of parking spots from public use to turn them over to the exclusive use of a for-profit company. Or the massive fines ParkIndy, the private operator of our public parking meters, will levy upon the city for the permanent removal of the parking spaces. Despite the $6 million dollar in help from city taxpayers, don't expect that to make it any cheaper to rent one of these cars. A 2014 estimate puts the estimate at $15 for an hour, or membership fees at $10-15 for a week or an annual membership costing about $15 a month.<br /><br />Total costs work out to about 98,000 per car.<br /><br />Had enough Indy?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/07/la-starts-electric-car-sharing-program.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-07-28T08:53:55.995-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-3700497420067142354";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 12:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"gambling";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Mike Pence";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"Governor Pence Throws Gaming Commission Under Bus";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2103:"The Indiana Gaming Commission has gotten into some hot water for sending out a letter to a Muncie-based assisted living home concerning a Euchre game that has a small betting pool and modest prizes.

And in practice, gambling (Both casinos and the like as well as lotteries) disproportionately target poor and minority communities and little to no revenue from the taxes collected on gambling end up helping the populations it prays on.<br /><br />But to me, it seemed like the Indiana Gaming Commission was just doing its job. Governor Pence has a law degree and probably has a few juris doctorate holders in his administration, and a few lawyers on speed dial.

At least seven other IMPD officers have been arrested for similar charges since 2013. Other recent headlines show that an IMPD officer is on administrative leave due to accusations <a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/joseph-taylor-impd-officer-under-investigation-for-domestic-violence">of spousal abuse.</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2015/05/27/impd-officer-found-dead-home-identified/28000123/">And there's the strange case of an IMPD officer found dead in a home, the same home that another man died in after an ingestion of chloroform</a>.<br /><br />IMPD, we need to have a talk.<br /><br />When I was writing this blog on a more regular basis, I had several people within IMPD, officers and others, who would come to me as sources. When I ran for council in 2011, I was the only non-major party candidate endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 86. I've also had <a href="https://twitter.com/rickfop86">Rick Snyder</a> from the FOP on the former podcast Civil Discourse Now. I'm not listing these things to brag, but to show that this is coming from someone who respects law enforcement and is sympathetic to how difficult the job can be, especially with the current occupants of the 25th floor.<br /><br />But I'm finding it more and more difficult to defend IMPD in cases like these.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/opinion/article_39ee63de-fa5f-11e4-9860-97c2a9b28b37.html">In her weekly column in the <i>Indianapolis Recorder</i></a>, Shannon Williams recounted an experience she had &nbsp;when she reported an officer's behavior to the Citizen Police Complaint Board. Williams, the President of the Recorder Media Group, had called dispatch to file a report because her dog was struck in a hit and run. She was able to file a report, and she had no problems filing the complaint with the board, but the official report on the officer uncovered the officer's side of the incident.<br /><br />Williams claims that:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 15px;">"...aspects of the report were not only inaccurate, but some “findings” were actual lies. My words were misconstrued completely and a false stage was set in an attempt to dispute my complaint or substantiate the inappropriate behavior of the officer."</span></blockquote><br />Among the specific claims that Williams found most ludicrous was that she was a victim of domestic violence, the officer claiming she never wanted a report filed, and that she lacked credibility. She also referred to the driver who hit her dog as "a gentleman", which the officer found inconsistent.<br /><br />Williams' overall point was that even though this was a minor transgression, she was shocked at the length IMPD went to discredit her for an officer that she alleged to be rude and incompetent. If this is what they do when an officer is rude to a citizen, to what extent are they going to protect someone who does something beyond rude?<br /><br />The last several years, rank and file officers and top brass have tried to promote a message that this is a new IMPD. Unfortunately, I can't say much has changed. A lot needs to be addressed from the top on down. I don't think the 25th floor or the top brass is going to step up to the challenge, so I hope the rank and file will help themselves out. It is going to be difficult, but it has to be done.<br /><br />And it wouldn't hurt if the mayoral candidates weighed in on this as well.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/06/impd-we-need-to-have-talk.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-06-23T10:03:26.926-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-2176705036729521121";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 May 2015 02:24:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"2015 Elections";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Angela Mansfield";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Christine Scales";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"I Support Councilor Mansfield and Councilor Scales";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5450:"<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SObk7dHnOUc/VNekAi4vNcI/AAAAAAAAKtA/ZBjCqhKxHso/s1600/Angela_Mansfield.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SObk7dHnOUc/VNekAi4vNcI/AAAAAAAAKtA/ZBjCqhKxHso/s1600/Angela_Mansfield.jpg" height="320" width="255" /></a><i>EDITOR'S NOTE: I have contributed financially to both of these candidates and will be working as a volunteer for a few hours Tuesday morning for Angela Mansfield.</i></div><div><br /></div>I&nbsp;do not live in any of the districts that have contested primaries for this year's municipal election.

But his perplexing strategy of <a href="http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/opinion/article_75526980-ef6e-11e4-ac0b-3fce2e412ea5.html">avoiding candidate forums and declining to appear on Amos Brown's radio program</a> (probably the easiest booking opportunity ever for any candidate on a ballot within Marion County), as well as the massive amount of money he is raising for this race, are causes for concern.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>The district is also roughly what my grandfather, Gordon Gilmer, represented during his time on the council.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DMhE68A8IpA/UgwGKbZh9vI/AAAAAAAAIvk/fKCsJG1yfXk/s1600/Christine+Scales.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DMhE68A8IpA/UgwGKbZh9vI/AAAAAAAAIvk/fKCsJG1yfXk/s1600/Christine+Scales.jpg" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>District 3 is also on the northside of Indianapolis (northeast rather than northwest), and it should come as no surprise that I fully support and endorse Councilor Christine Scales.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know if I can recall exactly the first time I interacted with Councilor Scales directly. But several years ago, I received an invitation from someone inviting me to a meeting. I get a lot of legit looking spam via e-mail due to this blog, but I thought this sounded legit. The proposed sale of the water utility company had been proposed, and Councilor Scales was organizing a blogger round table. <a href="http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2010/05/my-take-on-watersewage-utility-sale-to.html">We were given the opportunity to directly question representatives of Citizens Energy Group on the proposed sale of the water utility</a>. It was a very productive and informative conversation.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Since then, Councilor Scales and I kept in touch. About a year or so ago, she was voted out of the caucus of the Council Republicans. I remember writing her shortly after about the possible switch of her party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. There were some Democrats (both on the council and off) who were absolutely targeting her as a party switch, while others were working behind the scenes. I wrote to her saying that if she didn't believe in her heart of hearts that she was a Democrat, then she should sit outside during caucus meetings with pride. She is one of the hardest working council members out there and will always hear you out, even if you don't live in her district.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you live in one of these council districts, I hope you consider supporting one of these courageous councilors. In an election where we're very likely to get more of the same from the powers-that-be, it'd be nice to send two councilors back to the City-County building who aren't bought and paid for.</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/05/i-support-councilor-mansfield-and.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-05-04T22:25:53.622-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:100:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SObk7dHnOUc/VNekAi4vNcI/AAAAAAAAKtA/ZBjCqhKxHso/s72-c/Angela_Mansfield.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-5547510240367471525";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 14:13:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"LGBT";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"A Little Update on Progress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3125:"Warning: May contain strong language.<br /><br />I have something to admit.<br /><br />I had an evolution, personally, in regards to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender culture and LGBT people.<br /><br />Not so much that I ever really questioned the need for equality in areas such as marriage or civil rights, but in terms of how I used language related to LGBT people.<br /><br />As a teenager in high school, and probably well into my late teens and early 20s, I casually used the word "gay" as an adjective. I remember using the word "homosexual" rather than "gay" to describe a gay man or gay people. Which in itself isn't specifically slander, it is a much more clinical term and in the context of how it is used today, it is often followed by words like "the homosexual agenda" or "the homosexual takeover of America".<br /><br />It also isn't too hard to find old social media accounts (before Twitter or Facebook were a thing) where I even casually used the word "fag" or called my friends "faggot".<br /><br />I don't know if I ever used those words in front of someone who was gay or lesbian. But statistically speaking, if they are anywhere between 2-5% of the population within the United States, my high school probably had a few. And as someone who has been hurt by words, I should realize how hurtful hearing those words can be. Even if they weren't directed at them.<br /><br />This is something I really regret. I'm not proud of it. But it is something I've done in the past. I've recognized it. And I'd like to think I take a more careful consideration of my words. Not just when talking about LGBT, but for all groups of people. I know words can hurt.<br /><br />Having been listening to a lot of conservative radio going ga-ga over Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration (Enrolled) Act, I've started to notice something. That even among conservative pundits on radio and television, the language has completely changed from what it was from 10 or even 5 years ago.<br /><br />Some are saying "gay" or "lesbian". Very few are using "homosexual". But most seem to just be saying "LGBT" or "GLBT" or they say the full four words. Most aren't even adding a joke about "alphabet soup" after saying it. I'm sure someone has used "faggot" on the radio, but not any show I've heard.<br /><br />I think that when you win a fight like that, it might be something you haven't even noticed. But I think winning that kind of fight is huge. When people who, weren't that long ago, were decrying the "homosexual agenda" are now just saying "gay" or "Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender". I think that is huge.<br /><br />Maybe my selective radio listening is why I'm noticing this. Maybe in the radio host's life, someone has come out of the closet to them. Maybe the parent company that owns the station had a corporate suit give them a mandate. I don't know the cause.<br /><br />But I think a win like that. I think that's big. I think that shows the culture is changing. And that even if some political battles might result in a stalemate or even a loss, the overall war and culture are being won over.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/04/a-little-update-on-progress.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-04-01T10:14:39.793-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-7683034523308577954";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 02:21:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Mike Pence";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"RFRA";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"RFRA Fallout Stronger Than Expected";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2953:"The passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has continued ever since Governor Mike Pence signed it into law.

They've been using religious universities that can still obtain state and federal grants and other situations.<br /><br />The question that I haven't heard proponents answer is that RFRA has been a known quantity on the federal and state level for around two decades.

That probably explains why nearly <a href="http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/hoosier-lottery-ivy-tech-partner-on-mooc/article_6ea11918-bdd4-11e4-b5c9-63de4b5389f1.html">every</a>&nbsp;single <a href="http://www.tristatehomepage.com/story/d/story/hoosier-lottery-teams-up-with-ivy-tech-for-financi/29805/lVgU0bwzM0S-5VPulFWTLw">article</a> looks <a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/lottery-ivy-tech-offer-free-financial-course">nearly</a> identical despite each one being authored by the individual media outlet or a specific reporter.<br /><br />In an exclusive sit down interview that never actually happened, I asked Taylor to explain how this partnership with Ivy Tech came about and why financial literacy was chosen.

When asked what part of the financial literacy course covers how to responsibly gamble the meager Social Security check Grandma lives off of away at a local gas station, Taylor reminded me that there's a 1-800 number on every Hoosier Lottery ticket for people who have an addiction to <b>gaming. "</b>Gambling only takes place on riverboat casinos", Taylor said, correcting me.<br /><br />I also couldn't let this chance pass without asking why the Hoosier Lottery has targeted an aggressive expansion of Lottery retailers and self-serve kiosks almost exclusively in poor and minority communities. And why the media campaign behind the Hoosier Lottery is almost always in the parts of town that could use a lift up. I asked her why the State Fairgrounds electronic billboard screams Lottery promotion day in and day out near a part of town where many African Americans live and what passes for a grocery store around there are usually pimping Hoosier Lottery tickets day in and day out, while the few retail outlets in Hamilton County that sell the Lottery have a lot less flare beside it.<br /><br />At that time, I was kindly escorted out of the completely made up media availability event.<br /><br />The Onion might as well just pack on up and move to Indianapolis.

Folds has twice paid a similar visit to Indiana, once to play with Fort Wayne's philharmonic and another to Indianapolis to perform with our own symphony.<br /><br />While there, I only drove by car to grab breakfast on Sunday morning and that's only because I was leaving the hotel. While my view of Louisville was limited, I felt that I found a lot of similarities to my home city of Indianapolis. In some ways they were good, and others not so much.<br /><br />Similar to Indianapolis, Louisville has a consolidated city-county government that took place in 2003, with the Sheriff and Clerk still retaining their separate roles due to the Kentucky state constitution. Louisville is also the only first class city in the state of Kentucky, allowing the state legislature to craft specific legislation that will only impact Louisville. While our Indianapolis-Marion County Council has 29 (soon to be 25), they have 26 councilors as well as a Mayor. Unlike our system, their council is election so that half of the members are up for election every two years.<br /><br />Politically, Kentucky has a viable Democratic party at the state level even though the state hasn't gone "blue" for a Presidential election since Bill Clinton in 1996. It has a Democratic Governor who won election in 2011 with 55% of the vote while the last two US Senate elections have been won by Republicans with 55% and 58% of the vote. In Louisville, a Republican hasn't been elected Mayor since the 1960s and Republicans only hold nine seats on the council.<br /><br />While walking around the city, I noticed several parking meters were bagged under the authority of the "<a href="http://louisvilleky.gov/government/parking-authority-parc">Parking Authority of River City</a>". The authority is a board appointed by the Mayor that oversees the parking regulation division of the city government. The board manages the meters, municipal garages, and neighborhood parking permit programs, among other things. Talking to some of the locals, most of them couldn't tell me when electric meters (which also still take coins, from what I could tell) were installed, but had been there for several years. One resident did note some areas are still using the old coin only meters.<br /><br />While Indianapolis privatized the entire arm of parking services and management, the city of Louisville owns the meters and other assets but contracts out the day-to-day operations to a private company.<br /><br />There's a story from the <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/06/30/parking-rates-rising-free-saturdays-ending/11760623/">Courier Journal about how Saturday parking meter fees have been allowed for a long time</a>, but only local police could write tickets on Saturday rather than Parking Authority workers. That has recently changed. However, the meters all read 7am-6pm Monday through Saturday. It does not seem like any section of the city gets special meter times, like some of the cultural districts do in Indianapolis.<br /><br />I also found it interesting how similar their "NuLu" district is with our Fountain Square or Mass Ave district. NuLu is just outside of the heart of downtown Louisville and the area is dotted with areas to grab a meal, a drink, candy, and other kinds of retail, as well as residential and lodging. A street corner that previously housed a&nbsp;maintenance shop is now w<a href="https://twitter.com/IndyMattStone/status/561894233364512769">hat appears to be a very hip, very cool looking bar</a>. Many of the buildings seem to have remodeled interiors while trying to preserve the exteriors.<br /><br />I also came across what appeared to be an abandoned building. Instead of leaving it to rot in the middle of their downtown, <a href="https://twitter.com/IndyMattStone/status/561635927571722241">they gutted the interior and turned it into what appears to be a playground or gathering place.</a>&nbsp;It wasn't open to the public at the time, but that seems to be a great idea.<br /><br />They also have a recently remodeled convention center. I didn't go inside, but they did appear to have a cafe that serves beer, pastries, and coffee that seemed to be generally open to the public. But unfortunately, if it was open on Sundays, it wasn't at the time I drove by.<br /><br />One thing I didn't notice a lot of is green space. Downtown Indianapolis is very fortunate to have several blocks of green space between Central Library and the federal court house between Meridian and Pennsylvania.<br /><br />I don't want to seem like I'm trying to make a sell on Louisville, because I'm not. There were two things that I felt were negatives for the city.<br /><br />One was the lack of affordable restaurants outside of business hours. It seems that many of the decently priced restaurants, where you can grab some soup, a sandwich, or your basic fare without ordering a several course meal, closed up shop on Friday at 5 when the workers left for the weekend. Even among the fine dining I saw, many of them didn't open until 4-6 in the evening. The district surrounding the sports stadium had several bars and&nbsp;restaurants&nbsp;open until the wee hours of the morning, but that was about it.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is a lot of "For Sale" or "Leasing opportunities available" in commercial buildings. Even in a very commercial corridor with several hotels, a sports stadium, and a Performing Arts Center (along with other landmarks I surely missed or overlooked), there sure seemed to be a lot of empty and underutilized office space. I don't know if that is part of a building boom whose bubble popped, or if Louisville is still struggling with the lagging economy. But it wasn't a very encouraging sign. Surely if a very well-off part of Louisville had signs of hardship, I can only imagine that areas that aren't as tourist and business friendly might be hit even harder.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/02/louisville-and-indianapolis-closer-than.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-02-01T17:04:45.358-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:132:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qH0iMHnZU8k/VM6i1pZxw6I/AAAAAAAAALM/JFeYPVLyoi0/s72-c/10926424_10101495534454034_7162832932071111965_n.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-8089641511870570551";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 25 Jan 2015 13:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Elections";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"Consolidated Primary?

What he's really proposing is doing what many other states do and take the labels away from municipal politics. I really don't love this idea because partisans and party workers honestly and truly believe there is a difference in how the political parties view their role as election officials and how government works. I also don't like the idea of someone claiming a "non-partisan" mantel even though we all know what jersey they are wearing.<br /><br />But I think there is some tinkering that can be done with municipal city and town elections that are held in Indiana. Some of it is proposed in the Indiana General Assembly.<br /><br /><a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/5/8/a/e/58aeaa53/HB1038.01.INTR.pdf">House Bill 1038</a> would move many of the municipal elections held in off, odd numbered years to even numbered years. It appears that they aren't all moving to the same year. Some offices would be moving to the Presidential year and others would be moving to the non-presidential year.<br /><br />Personally, I'd like to see Mayor in one election cycle and have the municipal legislative body in the next cycle. That way one can serve as a referendum on the other.<br /><br />But one bill I don't see being proposed in the general assembly, or elsewhere, is the elimination of publicly funded primaries.<br /><br />I think many people mistake primaries as some sort of election where one candidate goes up against another (or ore) candidate of the same party, they duke it out, and whoever gets the nomination goes on to face the other nominated candidates in November.<br /><br />What primaries actually are a system designed for the benefit of a political party, which is supposed to be a private organization with its own rules and regulating laws. Political organizations should have full and complete control over who they nominate. I believe these organizations can efficiently nominate candidates in a low cost way without the public having to dig out the massive amount of resources to pull off a public election in which not one public official is actually elected.<br /><br />Some people may scoff at this idea but it is the exact same system that is often used to fill political vacancies. It is also by the major parties of Indiana to nominate candidates for all of their state-wide office candidates besides Governor. The minor parties that are recognized in Indiana also decide their candidates by a political convention.<br /><br />And a number of states do this as well when nominating for President. They are called the "caucus" states. Yes, the Democratic and Republican parties of Iowa actually pay for their caucus.<br /><br />So can we have that discussion, Indiana?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/01/consolidated-primary-ill-see-your.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-01-25T22:21:36.541-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-7247483401478596080";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"2015 Elections";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"Downtown Business Owner Joins Indy Mayoral Race";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1916:"<a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/01/19/indy-republicans-tap-businessman-brewer-for-indy-mayor/22018391/">Word has leaked on Monday</a> that the Marion County GOP is set to announce local businessman Chuck Brewer as their surprise candidate for Indianapolis Mayor.

Visitors and newcomers alike often wander why all the liquor store parking lots are empty on Sundays, and why the alcohol section at Kroger is blocked off by a chips display?<br /><br />It is because the state of Indiana does not allow alcohol sales on Sundays at the retail level. Over the last several years, our lawmakers realized that prohibiting alcohol sales for one day a week could be bad for business. They've made exemptions for bars and restaurants, for breweries, wineries, and distilleries. You can get your drink on at the Sunday Colts game or any sporting event that has an alcohol license. But the ban on retail purchases still remains.<br /><br />A bill has been introduced in the Indiana General Assembly,<a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/06/bill-filed-allow-sunday-alcohol-sales-indiana/21334985/"> but it is by the same representative who has sponsored it before</a>. This <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/07/03/193865442/Indiana-Convenience-Stores-Sue-To-Sell-Cold-Beer">NPR Article from two years ago</a> highlights the main arguments pretty well from two of the leading lobbyists, one from the convenience and grocery stores and another from the package liquor stores.<br /><br />You're familiar with the argument by now. That allowing the retail sale of alcohol on Sundays could be devastating to the package liquor store industry, that it could be a job killer, that up to 25% of them could end up closing and that this is a mega corporate takeover trying to push down the little guy.<br /><br />Welcome to the big boy world, package.<br /><br />Can I call you package?<br /><br />Listen, I'm sympathetic to the argument. I am no fan of corporations trying to beat down independent, locally owned competition. I personally have gone out of my way to support mom and pop shops, even if it costs me a few extra bucks. I think consumers will pay a premium for premium service. I think a package liquor store, being smaller, will be able to more quickly respond to consumer demand than a gas station chain or a grocery chain. The guy who does the ordering for the chains might not even live in the same city as the store, or even the state!<br /><br />But if you provide a quality service, people will come. They'll come and they'll spend their money.<br /><br />Look at the cultural district of Broad Ripple within Indianapolis. There is a Starbucks right in the heart of it. But there's at least three independently owned coffee shops within blocks of it, two of which have been open for business for several years.<br /><br />Look at music stores like Luna Music and Indy CD and Vinyl in Indianapolis, Landlocked Music in Bloomington, and Von's Records in West Lafayette. Music sales, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/itunes-music-sales-down-more-than-13-this-year-1414166672">including digital</a>, are plummeting. Megastores that used to be major shopping attractions in some of the biggest cities in the country are <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/virgin-megastore-new-york-2">closed</a>. Music and entertainment chains like Sam Goody or FYE are either shut down or closing shops across the country. Even the music selection at chain stores like Best Buy and Wal-Mart now takes up a much smaller space than what it used to be.<br /><br />But these music stores are thriving because they are adopting to consumer demand. Admittedly, it is a niche market concentrated on vinyl records, used music, and in-store performances by local, regional, and national acts. But these stores stand strong despite stiff competition.<br /><br />So if you are a package liquor store and you become like, THE one stop shop to get HOOSIER craft beer or some other niche, and you have a&nbsp;knowledgeable&nbsp;and friendly staff, I think you'll do fine. Mr. Livengood (can I call you John?), I won't even charge you or your association for that advice.<br /><br />If all you do is charge $1-3 for a pack of Coors than what the grocery store is selling it for, then good luck with that.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/01/sunday-sales-why-not.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-01-12T21:10:00.414-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-3644394189361805948";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Jan 2015 13:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"crime";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Simon Malls";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"Castleton Square Mall Unrest Leaves More Questions Than Answers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5115:"If you live in the range of the Indianapolis/central Indiana news agencies, you've probably heard about the unrest that occurred Saturday night at Castleton Square Mall. An hour before the mall closed for the night, fights broke out among youth who were in the food court area. It spilled into one of the parking lots. Media reports vary among how large the fight was or how many were involved.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wthr.com/story/27755821/impd-no-arrests-in-castleton-square-mall-brawl">This video from WTHR</a>, while nothing of the actual fight, shows the crowd control that happened afterwards and shows some skirmishes happening among the crowd while police were present.<br /><br />It is important to note that this occurred during the end of the Christmas Break in the academic calendar.<br /><br />I think there are several important questions that need to be answered from all parties. That includes, but is not limited to:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Simon Malls, which owns and operates Castleton Square Mall</li><li>The powers-that-be in Indianapolis-Marion County politics</li><li>The Indianapolis community at large</li><li>The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department</li><li>The Indianapolis Media</li></ul><br /><br /><a href="http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/opinion/article_f3fac11e-7154-11e2-9ca5-0019bb2963f4.html">Simon Malls has repeatedly refused to enforce any type of curfew policy in their Indianapolis area malls and properties, including Castleton Square Mall and Circle Centre Mall in downtown Indy</a>. When Simon Malls used to run Mall of America, they instituted a curfew policy which allows those 15 and under to be escorted by an adult of 21 years of age or older during the weekend evenings. <a href="http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts">This policy still stands today</a>.<br /><br />Our elected officials, and those that give them money and essentially run this city, should really be taking a hard look at Simon Property Group. They are a major beneficiary of all sorts of tax incentives from the city and the state. Maybe some of those incentives should come with strings attached.<br /><br />Also, where is the social media presence from Simon? Where is any type of media presence? The few media types that were able to reach someone at Simon were met with "no comment." Their Twitter accounts for the <a href="https://twitter.com/CastletonSqMall/with_replies">individual mall</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/simonmalls">Simon Malls</a> are empty. This does not look good, and with no comment or guidance from Simon, the narrative is being set by the media. And it ain't pretty.<br /><br />Both the powers-that-be in Indianapolis-Marion County politics and our&nbsp;community&nbsp;as a whole have collectively failed to provide an environment where people between the ages of 14 and 20 can go and find something to do in a safe, drug free environment that doesn't break the bank. In his <i>Indianapolis Recorder</i>&nbsp;column from two years ago, Amos Brown writes that "every mayor since Steve Goldsmith has worked to stamp out activities that would appeal to today's teens". As someone who was a teenager not that long ago, that was my experience. I'm certain the same is still true today.<br /><br />I'm not a cop, but I know a few. When I ran for council in 2011, I was endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 86. So I'd like to think I have a good understanding of what law enforcement in Marion County is up against. I'd like to think I can&nbsp;empathize&nbsp;with them even if I don't agree with what they did or how they handled something. But I am completely confused as to how a brawl can break out, that requires police to be called, and not a single arrest is made.<br /><br />This just seems...off to me. I'm sure there is a logical explanation. But to me, just hearing that, it seems off.<br /><br />IMPD also needs to work on being more certain before putting out statements. Several times IMPD said they had some advance knowledge of something being planned for the Castleton Mall area, with Fox 59 WXIN calling it "social media intelligence". IMPD later said they had no advance knowledge of it. Which makes me wonder what is their "social media intelligence" division like, and if their was any evidence to suggest that this unrest at the mall was partially planned, why wasn't it discovered in advance?<br /><br />Finally, to my friends in the media. <a href="http://fox59.com/2015/01/03/police-investigating-shots-fired-at-castleton-square-mall/">A couple</a> of <a href="http://www.wthr.com/story/27754377/shots-fired-outside-amc-at-castleton-square-mall">area news agencies</a> published headlines saying "shots fired" (you can make out the original headline in the URL rather than what the headline text was later edited to). That turned out not to be true, and other news agencies covered their asses by saying "Reportedly" or "witnesses". It is sometimes hard to be a good judge of character when covering a chaotic crowd. But sometimes, it pays to be a bit more patient rather than to have egg on your face.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2015/01/castleton-square-mall-unrest-leaves.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2015-01-05T08:00:01.719-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-8186046205164418300";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 03 Nov 2014 16:47:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"2010 Elections";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"2014 Election";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"A Look Back: Marion County 2010 Election Analysis";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9527:"With the 2014 "midterm" election just a few days away, I wanted to dive back and look at what happened four years ago in 2010. While I'm only looking over what happened in Marion County, Indiana and limiting myself to only the races all Marion County voters could vote in, I'm also taking into consideration events happening throughout the state and nation that could influence the outcome. In addition to looking at a candidate's vote total and vote percentage, I'll also be looking at the vote total for each office on the ballot. I'll also look into why candidate's of the same party may receive different vote totals or percentages of the vote. Finally, if there is no Libertarian candidate on the ballot, where do those Libertarian voters go?<br /><br />At the top of the ballot was a United States Senate race, followed by three state-wide elections for Secretary of State, Auditor of State, and Treasurer of State. Following any state legislative races, the county wide offices were listed in the order of Prosecutor, Clerk, Auditor, Recorder, Sheriff, and Assessor. I initially planned on analyzing each race, but the US Senate and the state-wide races actually provide perfect examples of how votes shift based on circumstances of a race, availability of a specific political party's candidate to vote for, the "protest vote", and how people change their votes even when a candidate from a specific political party isn't available.<br /><br />My source for these statistics are from the <a href="http://www.indy.gov/eGov/County/Clerk/Election/Election_Info/Past_Results/Pages/2010GeneralElectionSummaryResults.aspx">Marion County Clerk's certified election results</a>.<br /><br />Nationally, Democrats had victories across the nation in 2006 and 2008. With the national Tea Party movement arguably at the peak of its power, Republicans swept elections across the United States, gaining a majority in the United States House of Representatives and&nbsp;strengthening&nbsp;their minority within the United States Senate. Within the states, 29 Governorships ended up in the hands of Republicans and a majority of the state legislatures had GOP majorities as well, including our state of Indiana. It was a good year for Republicans. And even though Marion County is a Democratic county, the votes still reflect a strong Republican year even though no Republican won a majority in any contest that all Marion County voters could participate in.<br /><br />The top of the ballot was a United States Senate race that was won by a former GOP US Senator, Dan Coats. Even though the total number of votes for the race was 214,077, neither Coats nor his Democratic challenger, then-US Rep Brad Ellsworth, received the most votes among their party's candidates eligible for a county wide vote. Coats finished last among all Republican candidates in Marion County, while Ellsworth trailed Democratic candidates in the much lower profile races of County Sheriff, Clerk, and Recorder. Ellsworth's campaign had a late start when US Senator Evan Bayh opted not to run for re-election, announcing the decision only days before the filing deadline to run in the Democratic primary closed. With no candidate on the primary ballot, the state Democratic Party had to vote and the <a href="http://indydemocrat.blogspot.com/2010/05/isd-abstains-from-vote-to-put-ellsworth.html">Indiana Stonewall Democrats abstained from voting</a>. He also s<a href="http://indydemocrat.blogspot.com/2010/06/ellsworth-misses-pride.html">kipped out on Indy Pride that year, though staffers were present</a>. Looking back, it would be hard for any Democrat to win a US Senate Race in Indiana in 2010.<br /><br />Coats ran honestly a boring race in the general, but his campaign wasn't a perfect campaign either. He won a GOP primary only because the Tea Party vote was split between four candidates and only rented a home and gathered enough signatures just before the deadline to be in the primary. <a href="http://advanceindiana.blogspot.com/2010/02/coats-is-fish-out-of-water.html">Throughout the campaign, he was surrounded on questions of where he lived and why he didn't run for re-election back in 1998</a>.<br /><br />For disgruntled Republicans, Democrats, and actual Libertarians, the Libertarian candidate Rebecca-Sink Burris benefited receiving 11,879 votes, the most votes any LP candidate received that qualified for a county wide vote.<br /><br />The Secretary of State race is special because a party that wins at least 2% of the vote in this contest gains automatic ballot access for the next four years. The Libertarian Party makes a special effort in this race so as to maintain automatic ballot access. On a county-by-county basis, the party that wins the SOS race also gets placed first on the ballot, so even if a party knows it is going to win or lose the race state wide, they'll still put in an effort in their strongholds to get the best ballot placement in general elections.<br /><br />Two outside factors played an important part in this race. Democratic candidate Vop Osili is an Indianapolis native and campaigned heavily within Marion County. GOP candidate Charlie White, who won, was eventually forced out of office due to a series of felony convictions, including voter fraud. While the criminal charges and eventual conviction didn't occur until after he took office, <a href="http://hamiltoncopolitics.blogspot.com/2010/09/law-breakers-should-not-be-law-makers.html">the blogosphere</a> started <a href="http://hamiltoncopolitics.blogspot.com/2010/11/knee-jerk-politics.html">to pick up on the story as the election played out</a>. At the time, sources told me that the White campaign effectively stopped campaigning in the final days of the campaign. Generally, the state-wide non-gubernatorial races are fairly low profile and people vote for the party they feel most aligned with, and White underperformed compared to the GOP candidates for Auditor of State and Treasurer of State.<br /><br />Mike Wherry, the LP candidate for Secretary of State, seemed to gather some protest votes for Republicans who couldn't vote for White. Independents seemed also to break for Osili, perhaps due to the campaigning he did or having the home court advantage. He very well may have gotten some disgruntled Republican votes as well.<br /><br />The difference in vote totals between Secretary of State and Auditor of State, 1780, can mostly be attributed to the drop off in the Libertarian candidate no longer being used as a protest vote. The Libertarian candidate only had 1510 less votes in the Auditor's race but the Republican candidate, incumbent Tim Berry, performed very well in the race getting nearly 47% of the vote while the Democrat didn't even crack 50% in Marion County. In these lower profile races, with no extenuating circumstances, people tend to go with their party identity and vote that candidate since they aren't familiar with the issues surrounding the race or the candidates. The Democratic candidate for Auditor of State also gets the honor of the lowest vote total for any Democrat running in 2010 that all Marion County voters were able to vote for.<br /><br />Treasurer of State only had 603 less votes than Auditor but no Libertarian candidate. The vast majority of voters who chose Libertarian candidates elsewhere on the ballot simply chose one of the two major party candidates, Democrat Pete Buttigieg or Republican incumbent Richard Mourdock. Mourdock received 5754 more votes than the GOP candidate for Auditor did, while Buttigieg received &nbsp;2195 more votes than the Democratic candidate for Auditor. If we had those two vote differences together and add the 603 less votes cast in this race, we get 8552, which is the same number of votes the Libertarian candidate received in the Auditor race. Mourdock had already been making the rounds at Tea Party meetings, so it is likely that self-identified Libertarians were already familiar with him and that's why they broke for him in such strong numbers.<br /><br />Races for Treasurer and Auditor are important because, to the average voter, they have no idea who these people even are, and might not even know what the office of Auditor or Treasurer even does. In that case, voters are more likely to default to their standard political affiliation. Even more important in Indiana politics is that for a Democrat to win a state-wide seat, they really need to drive up the margins within Marion County and Lake County and not do horrible elsewhere. So if a Democrat candidate is only going to win Marion County by a slim margin, such as in the Treasurer of State's race, things don't bode well for Democrats.<br /><br />And a brief note on the county races: Discounting the Prosecutor's race, which received the bulk of campaign money and media attention, they all heavily re-enforce that Marion County is a Democratic county. There are some interesting disparity in the numbers each Democrat candidate received, but that likely has to do with who really worked with grassroots party activist and who just decided to coast on the Democratic baseline. Also of note that even though the state-wide races had a decent showing for their GOP candidates within Marion County, that didn't translate into votes for Republicans lower on the ballot.<br /><br />What does this have to do with the 2014 race tomorrow? Probably nothing. But it is interesting to see how voters well...vote. We'll of course have fun analyzing the 2014 results later this week.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-look-back-marion-county-2010-election.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-11-03T11:47:37.312-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-3784722264034219721";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 15:42:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"2014 Election";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"IPS School Board";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Kelly Bentley";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Mary Ann Sullivan";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"Some Open Questions on IPS School Board Candidates and Campaigns";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5428:"I'll go ahead and say that I am completely unfamiliar with what the formal laws are regarding school board candidates and their campaigns, or if they operate differently than partisan political candidates and their campaign committees.

One of the items on the agenda was the proposed elimination of the county homestead tax credit. The meeting ended with tabling that proposal and public comment was not sought on it.<br /><br />Now, I am a major proponent of public comment being allowed on all items that are heard before a governmental body. I have been critical in the past of policies that have been used to suppress or limit attendees from the general public from having their views heard, especially when proponents for whatever is being pushed often get several uninterrupted minutes as part of the meeting for a full blown presentation, complete with audio and visual and handing pamphlets to the committee, the full works. Sometimes public comment is limited to two minutes per person. Sometimes that limit is enforced with a loud buzzer.<br /><br />But this is budget time. The time where every single agency comes before the respective council committees and does some really hard crunching. These meetings often looked packed when the committee first starts out, and as the budgets are worked through, the people leave after their budget was heard. This is not the sexy part of municipal governance. In fact, it can be very dry. But it is important and must be done.<br /><br />The budgets should take priority. Policy proposals can take a backseat until then.<br /><br />After reading over the outraged press release from the Marion County Republican Party and the reporting on WRTV, <a href="http://indydemocrat.blogspot.com/2014/09/mansfield-responds-to-chairman-walkers.html">Jon Easter actually wrote the chair of the committee</a>, Angela Mansfield. She responded saying that the&nbsp;constituents&nbsp;were disappointed but learned that tabling just means it can be dealt with at a different committee meeting. She also wrote that of the three that complained, two were against the elimination of the local homestead tax credit. She also pointed out the proposal in committee is strictly about the elimination and not what to do with the increase in revenue if it is to pass.<br /><br />So kudos to Council Mansfield on running her committee with&nbsp;efficiency&nbsp;and prioritizing the important work of the committee and separating it from the garbage council Republicans and the 25th floor are pushing.<br /><br />And just a quick link to Pat Andrews' blog, <a href="http://hadenoughindy.blogspot.com/2014/09/why-councillor-robinson-voted-against.html">I'm liking Councilor Robinson more and more nowadays.</a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2014/09/council-shenanigans-public-comment-and.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-09-18T11:25:50.080-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-5977539284598449131";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Jul 2014 12:55:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"TSA";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"My PSA on TSA";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5477:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m4D7HFgA5Nw/U7qMKorXP7I/AAAAAAAAAKY/aMOvlOcmqck/s1600/Bq-WyJ8IUAEBxIt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m4D7HFgA5Nw/U7qMKorXP7I/AAAAAAAAAKY/aMOvlOcmqck/s1600/Bq-WyJ8IUAEBxIt.jpg" height="320" width="240" /></a></div><b><br /></b><b>EDITOR'S NOTE: </b>As I was writing this blog, I started talking a lot more about the reasons I was traveling rather than the specific issue I had with the TSA in Orlando International Airport (MCO). I'll cover that in another blog later in the week.<br /><br />Pictured above is my service dog, <a href="http://twitter.com/questthedog">Quest</a>. I've traveled with him before, and as I left Indianapolis, the TSA agents and the airline staff were very&nbsp;accommodating. I also have an implanted cardiac pacemaker &nbsp;so I can't go through the metal detectors. Even though doctors assure me I can go through the X-ray machine things, I choose not to as a form of solidarity with Quest. Since no matter what, he has to get patted down. So I figure I should too. I had absolutely no problems with the TSA when I traveled with Quest six years ago, or leaving Indianapolis.<br /><br />I think it is important to point out that I was leaving Orlando on a Saturday, probably a peak time for the airport. And the airport is busy. They had all the passengers who were in wheelchairs, had strollers, or some type of disability in one line and everyone else in a separate line. It was a long line but we were steadily moving. In addition to handling Quest, I was also carrying a CPAP machine with me (these need to be taken out of their case when being scanned by TSA) as well as my carry on backpack. I thought I'd put the things in my pockets into my backpack to make the process easier, including my wallet. My wallet had over $100 in cash.<br /><br />As I approached the area where you're supposed to unload your carry ons into the scanner, I was told by a TSA agent "You need to wait in the center." I responded with "I was just about to..." and he said "I don't care what you were going to do. Step to the side" and then he vanished into the crowd. I was going to tell him I was opting out.<br /><br />So here I stand in the center, figuring maybe I've been randomly picked for enhanced screening or whatever. So I'm just standing there, with my luggage and my dog, for 10 minutes. At least a dozen people who were certainly behind me have now gone through and are on their way. Apparently, it is a normal thing at Orlando International for travelers to just stand in the middle of a busy TSA check point because no one seemed to notice I was there.<br /><br />After that time passed, someone tried to wave me through and direct me through the metal detector. I kindly told him I can't and can you please come to me so I can speak to you without shouting. After informing him that I was dragged to the side and ordered to stay here by a TSA agent before telling anyone I have a cardiac pacemaker and wanted to opt out, he acknowledged that and then left.<br /><br />Shortly after, a separate TSA agent came over to collect my things, saying he'll put them through the scanner for me.<br /><br />Those of you who know me personally know I never let anyone touch my CPAP machine. I am the only one who touched it. If someone drops it and breaks it, it'll be me and my fault because it is my&nbsp;responsibility. As it looks like he's about to put it through without taking it out of the case, I shout to him it needs to be taken out.<br /><br />After five more minutes of waiting and telling a separate TSA agent that I have a pacemaker and asking specifically if I need to remove my shoes and being told no, he then changed his mind and said yes. So I took off my shoes.<br /><br />I was then led through a very small gate between the metal detector and the X-Ray body scan machine. As I got around, I could see that my luggage was causing a pile up because it had been sitting at the end of the line for several minutes. I was hoping nobody had snatched my wallet while it had been sitting there.<br /><br />I was then informed that my shoes had been lost. Several TSA agents looked at me as if it was my fault that my shoes were lost and not theirs for letting my luggage, including my life support CPAP machine, be unattended for several minutes.<br /><br />The crack TSA team, or the TSA team thats on crack, I always get those confused....anyway, they finally found my shoes with someone who clearly has much larger feet than mine trying to fit his feet into my shoes.<br /><br />So in the span of 20 minutes, I was made to needlessly wait while several dozen people who were behind me were let through with ease. In that span, my luggage, including my money and credit cards and my boarding pass, could easily have been stolen. I was never told why I was singled out and told to wait in the center for several minutes. No one seemed to have an idea why.

In an interview, he noted such reports by The Star.<br />But  he said in the statement that some commentators'  remarks against  Eisgruber "can only be characterized as insulting, attacking the  integrity of the judge and, in some instances, communicating physical  threats."<br />"We do not believe that any of such conduct is appropriate no matter how strongly one's opinion is of this matter," he said.</blockquote><br /><br />I encourage Abrams, the president of the Indianapolis Bar Association, to contact Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, the Marion County Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the US District Attorney's office for all of the comments he read that were physical threats against Judge Eisgruber. Online threats are still threats and should be dealt with appropriately.<br /><br />As for the rest, the comments that were "insulting" and "attacking the integrity of the judge", Abrams can go get himself a bottle to suck on.<br /><br />Judges are public officials. In some cases, such as Judge Eisgruber, they are elected officials. The courts and everything within, including their salaries, come from taxpayers. Therefore, we can treat them and comment on them however we damn well please. If Judge Eisgruber or any other judge can't take the heat, then they are free to find some other form of employment.<br /><br />Whenever the United States Supreme Court is in session, you can turn on any cable news channel and watch political pundits, some of them law degree holders and some even are practicing lawyers, lambast and rip to shreds the decisions and the votes some Supreme Court justices cast. But the Supremes are big boys and girls. They can handle it.<br /><br />Maybe Adams should take a cue from them. Suck it up, or find another occupation.<br /><br />Judge Eisgruber, who is a Republican, is uncontested in his campaign for Marion Superior Court in this fall's election.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2014/06/somebody-call-whambulance-for-state-bar.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-06-19T21:39:20.292-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3551647111924186318.post-5374058011303804139";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 31 May 2014 10:45:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Civil Discourse Now";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Civil Discourse Now at Democratic Convention, and a Format Change";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1630:"Civil Discourse Now will be broadcasting live today, 11am-1pm, at the Indiana Democratic Party's convention at the Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis.

Last week, while I took a break to research some news, I checked into the station to discover that not only were we not on the air, but something else was being played in our time slot.<br /><br />We hope to resolve that situation today, with the launch of <a href="http://www.live365.com/stations/civildiscoursenow">7 Bits Of Info</a> on Live365. To listen, just go to the link and click play. An embedded Live365 player will be on the blog shortly. We won't only be broadcasting live, but we'll also use this station to air "classic" episodes of Civil Discourse Now. And some of our pre-taped segments will air on their own, instead of embedded within the program. I am also working on digging up some interviews I have on cassette tapes and broadcasting them on the station.<br /><br />If you have a smartphone or tablet, download the Live365 app and point it to 7 Bits Of Info.<br /><br />I know the transition may be rough for some listeners and fans. After all, it wasn't that long ago that this show was broadcasting live from UStream and had a video feed.

There are no state-wide offices on the primary ballot. This year, all of those offices will be decided in conventions of the respective parties. But there are county wide elections being held, a handful of referendums, and the town of Fishers, now being a city, will be holding its first municipal primary today for their city government.<br /><br />Within Marion County county wide offices and the 7th Congressional District, I'm not expecting anything too out of the ordinary. I've spotted some t-shirts, yard signs, and even one of those billboards-on-a-truck for Mark Brown, the IMPD officer challenging Sheriff John Layton in the Democratic primary. But I've also seen Layton roll out his A-game as well. It isn't so much that I think Brown will win, but it could be interesting to see if Brown breaks, say, 40%. He's not running a paper candidacy and obviously has some money to spend. But listening to him on Amos Brown's program, I felt that he just wasn't ready for prime time.<br /><br />While some may be hopeful that one of the three unslated judicial candidates in the Democratic primary may make it through, the slate has performed strongly in the past. I'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />The Republicans have a five way race going on in the 7th Congressional District primary. Cat Ping came within a few points of beating Carlos May last time around, so I expect the same may occur again.<br /><br />Social media reports are saying the race between Bob Behning and Michael Scott in the District 91 Republican primary has gotten heated. I don't live in that part of the county, so maybe I'm not hearing the ads myself. It could be the closest race this neck of the woods will get.

The club is in downtown Indianapolis on Delaware Street at 615 North Delaware Street. Theoretically, it is a Mini Marathon edition of the show.<br /><br />The regular host of the show, Mark Small, will be "doing" the Mini during the show. We are uncertain on when, or even if, he'll arrive. So I'll be at the helm hosting the show.<br /><br />The Mini is put on by the 500 Festival and is one of several events organized by the group. You can read a history of each of the official races at their <a href="http://www.500festival.com/mini-marathon/race-history">website</a>.<br /><br />In addition to our pre-taped segments on fashion, sports, and Tale Of A City, I'll be airing two interviews that I recorded as well. One is with Rick Snyder, the first Vice President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 86. The FOP lodge is the fraternal and labor organization of choice for much of law enforcement within Marion County.<br /><br />I initially talked to Rick because we were planning on doing a crime and public safety show. He committed to a pre-taped interview because he couldn't make it to the show. Unfortunately, the plans fell through for the rest of the show but I think the FOP's side should be heard.<br /><br />I also talked to Marion Superior Court judicial candidate Greg Bowes. Greg is one of three unslated judicial candidates running in the Democratic primary. During the interview, we talk about Greg's background as a public servant and a lawyer, his thoughts on slating, and what he brings to the table should he be elected as a judge. The eight Democratic candidates who come out of the primary will go on with eight Republican candidates for 16 slots in the November election.<br /><br />Mark will also be Skyping in during the Mini, or so he says.<br /><br />Feel free to join us. The Club is open to guests but a Member In Good Standing must pay for any food or beverages ordered. That may be a challenge, but it is one I am up for.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://indystudent.blogspot.com/2014/05/mini-marathon-edition-of-civil.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"noreply@blogger.com (Indy Student)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2014-05-02T17:00:00.094-04:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:39:"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearchrss/1.0/";a:3:{s:12:"totalResults";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"507";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:10:"startIndex";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:12:"itemsPerPage";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"25";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:13:{s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:4:"etag";s:40:"W/"ea476a9f-59b1-49ab-97a2-b114d56126ee"";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:53:56 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:34:"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8";s:6:"server";s:15:"blogger-renderd";s:13:"cache-control";s:52:"public, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=1";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:7:"expires";s:29:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:53:57 GMT";s:22:"x-content-type-options";s:7:"nosniff";s:16:"x-xss-protection";s:13:"1; mode=block";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 17:10:16 GMT";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"38987";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130725002037";}
