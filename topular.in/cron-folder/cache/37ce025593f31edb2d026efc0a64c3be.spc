<p>For many people, one of the best ways to learn to do something is to watch someone else do it. Here are some topics you might search for online, organized by topic:</p>
<h3>Computer Software</h3>
<p>This may be the quickest path to another job. If you use a software product (or want to use it), take a look at videos online of people explaining how to operate that program. This might be anything from<strong> productivity applications </strong> (Microsoft Office, Google Docs) to <strong>speciality software</strong> (QuickBooks, Peach Tree, Photoshop, Premiere, Final Cut Pro) or even applications your business already uses. </p>
<h3>Machinery and Equipment</h3>
<p>If you work in an environment where things require service or repair, you can learn more about how they are made by doing online research. In particular, videos of people making or assembling equipment can be highly educational.</p>
<h3>Professional Etiquette and Communication</h3>
<p>Your next job may require you to interact with a different caliber of person, or talk to people from another culture or who speak another language. You can use online clips to find out how to navigate social or professional social situations, what to wear, how to do small talk, or even how to speak, read, and write a foreign language.</p>
<h3>Food Preparation and Services</h3>
<p>The amateur chef has already found tons of great recipes online. But if you want to work in any aspect of the service industry, you can learn more about food, wine, cooking, cleaning, or customer service than you would ever dream.</p>
<h3>Business and Economics Knowledge</h3>
<p>Ready to move into better chair or to a nicer office? Learn more about the world of business by making your own online course on business ethics, process improvement, employee development, conflict management, corporate finance, international relations, or more.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s knock out the obvious definition first: <strong>a political conservative.</strong> That&#8217;s a person who tends to be more on the right side of the political spectrum. Of course, there are a variety of opinions about the best way to operate our country, so when I speak about &#8220;conservatism&#8221; in the workplace I am not talking about national or regional or even Indianapolis city politics. Of course sometimes the progressive / liberal / Democratic approach has merit, and sometimes the conservative / traditional / Republican approach might be best. </p>

<p>The second type of conservatism refers to the <strong>degree of risk you are willing to take.</strong> Sometimes, it&#8217;s a good idea to be bold and rush out into the marketplace or to try something which could be a result in a serious failure. Sometimes, it&#8217;s wise to play it safe and &#8220;be conservative.&#8221; And again, every situation is different. It&#8217;s sometimes good to be aggressive and sometimes good to be conservative.</p>
<p>The third type of conservatism is <strong>a refusal to consider new ideas.</strong> It&#8217;s this brand of being conservative that is a problem. I hear it all the time from business owners, employees, and jobseekers alike. They say things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter is just a fad. I don&#8217;t need to do that.</li>
<li>People will come around to the old way of doing things, you wait.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to do it the old fashioned way.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s worked this way for the past forty years, why should today be any different?</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be clear that this is a major issue. If you&#8217;re looking for jobs by checking the classifieds in the newspaper, you&#8217;re making a mistake. If you&#8217;re trying to find the best service company by opening the yellow pages, you&#8217;re missing out. And if you&#8217;re not at least learning a little about new technology, you&#8217;re not going to have much chance to compete.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this definition of conservatism that we should all be wary of. Not that we should always do the new thing, but that we should always consider it.</p>
<p>In the words of Grace Hopper: &#8220;The most dangerous phrase in the English language is, &#8216;we&#8217;ve always done it this way.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Consider doing something different.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with calling people on the phone. When should you pick up the phone and call someone at random?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s easy. <strong>Pretty much almost never.</strong></p>
<p>Why is that? Because a phone call is interrupting someone&#8217;s day and it is insisting that they should stop whatever they are doing and talk to you. So, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be calling them&#8212;at least not at random.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rotary_phone_qs56zyn3jj.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full" id="rotary_phone_qs56zyn3jj.jpg" alt="Rotary Phone" width="494" height="330" /><br />&copy; Flickr User Nate Steiner</p>
<p>So when <em>should</em> you call people on the phone? Here are the three reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. You have a truly urgent need.</strong> Once in a while, we need to talk to a person <em>right now</em> to get an answer <em>right away.</em> The rest of the time, you can send an email.</p>
<p><strong>2. You&#8217;re making a personal touch.</strong> This is when we have no particular reason to call someone except to be friendly. For example: it&#8217;s great to call people on their birthday or because they are a friend and you are thinking of them and want to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>3. The call was scheduled.</strong> This is a meeting, except on the telephone. You&#8217;re calling at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not one of the three reasons, you&#8217;d better start the call by saying who you are and asking &#8220;do you have a minute to speak with me, or would it be better to chat at another time?&#8221; (Because assuming that they are available is rude.)</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got that out of the way, allow me to explain how to answer the call.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hello, this is Robby Slaughter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it. But too many people answer with not quite enough. &#8220;Hullo&#8221; is no way to answer a phone.</p>
<p>Now that you know, spread the message. But don&#8217;t do it by phone. That would be rude.</p>

<p>Getting a job is kind of like getting a small business loan from a bank: if you frantically need it in order to pay your bills, it&#8217;s probably not going to happen. But if your affairs are in order and you give off a quiet confidence, you&#8217;re likely to get an offer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because employers want to hire people who they see as stable, long-term investments. They want to bring in candidates who plan for the future and who are going to want to be part of the business for years to come.</p>
<p>Compare that with someone who just needs a job because they are struggling to pay rent. That person is likely to bail as soon as a higher-paying gig comes along. If you have work to be done, it makes the most sense to find people to do the work who are in no rush.</p>
<p>So how do you act like you are not desperate (even if you really do need to make money ASAP)? </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2014/09/need-a-job-immediately-heres-what-you-do-first/">If you&#8217;re broke, use a different strategy </a>for solving that immediate problem</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t call people incessantly. Don&#8217;t keep bugging them too often to try and get their attention.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mention your personal financial situation to employers</li>
<li>Talk about how you&#8217;re filling your time <em>besides</em> looking for work, such as volunteer efforts</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over-thank people for their time or for an offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to get a job is to act like you don&#8217;t need the money. Although that might seem a little deceptive&#8212;since most of us need to generate income&#8212;it shouldn&#8217;t be your objective in finding work. Show that you have passion, expertise, and that you can provide value. That&#8217;s what matters to employers, and what will get you an offer instead of a rejection.</p>

<p>And for LinkedIn especially, how should you react when a stranger makes a connection request?<span id="more-2348"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.indyatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/linkedin_pen_s7gevkvh3t.jpg" class="aligncenter size-full" id="linkedin_pen_s7gevkvh3t.jpg" alt="LinkedIn Pen" width="494" height="371" /><br />&copy; Flickr User Sheila Scarborough</p>
<p>Before I answer this question, I should say first that LinkedIn etiquette is an area of major controversy. While this opinion I&#8217;m about to share is strongly rooted in logic and the official terms of service for the platform, not everyone agrees. But I will say that it works for me.</p>
<p>First of all, it&#8217;s important you have the <strong>same philosophy for interacting with others</strong> that you have for yourself. This concept predates online social networking. You might have heard it called &#8220;the golden rule.&#8221; So whatever guideline you decide to follow for inbound LinkedIn connections, expect the same for outbound connections.</p>
<p>Second, you&#8217;re not supposed to connect with <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2014/02/do-you-invite-and-accept-everyone-on-linkedin-stop-that/">people on LinkedIn that you don&#8217;t actually know.</a> The system makes it ridiculously easy to invite your address book and presents suggestions constantly, so this may be a surprise. But LinkedIn does not work if everyone accepts everyone. </p>
<p>Third, if LinkedIn provides an <a href="https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2974/~/i-don%E2%80%99t-know-this-person">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know this person&#8221; link</a>. Clicking on that is punitive; do it enough times and it becomes harder for the other person to invite people. So, be careful about doing that.</p>
<p>So what should you do? My suggestion is that you <strong>reply with a script and then delete the request.</strong> The reason to reply is to help figure out if the request could be legitimate without shutting down the opportunity to make a new contact. And the reason to delete the request is so it doesn&#8217;t clutter your inbox. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my script. Feel free to steal it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi FIRSTNAME!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the invite on LinkedIn. I appreciate you reaching out here.</p>
<p>I have to admit I am scratching my head though. Where is it that we met? </p>
<p>Given my memory, sounds like we should get a cup of coffee or schedule a phone call to get to know each other better.</p>
<p>Want to put something on the calendar? If so, please email me at rslaughter@accelawork.com&#8212;LinkedIn messaging is a bit wonky for me. Thanks!</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Robby
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s my reasoning for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I always want to use their first name, since a request is personal. That also shows them I&#8217;m paying attention.</li>
<li>I also want to show appreciation. It might be the case that they made an effort to find me and make the request. That&#8217;s something worth noting.</li>
<li>Because I believe LinkedIn is really for people I know in person, I ask them to remind me where it is that we met&#8212;and if we didn&#8217;t, to set up a time for us to get together. I&#8217;m not opposed to making a new contact, but it has to be genuine.</li>
<li>Finally, I ask them to email me. That&#8217;s because <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2014/07/please-dont-send-me-a-message-on-linkedin/">LinkedIn messaging is a pain</a> (and this proves they are paying attention.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, at least half of people never respond to my script. I take that to mean they weren&#8217;t really serious about using LinkedIn as a place to network with people they actually know, or that it was an accident. And the rest of the responses lead to phone calls or coffee meetings&#8212;which have made a difference!</p>
<p>Try it yourself. Or, let me know if I&#8217;m off base in the comments.</p>

<p>The opposite is true. You&#8217;re not actually boring. You&#8217;re an exciting, engaging person with a complex personality, a fascinating life story, and a variety of interests. And it&#8217;s also not the case at all that companies are looking to hire boring people, but for some reason that&#8217;s what it seems like people think.

<p>Here are some boring things you probably do in your job search:</p>
<p><strong>You look for jobs online, and apply to them using the process requested by the employer.</strong> That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do, right? Except, that&#8217;s not all that interesting, and most jobs are found through networking, not applying directly. You should figure out who you know and <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2014/01/the-best-job-interview-approach-ensuring-it-doesnt-matter/">make the interview not matter.</a></p>
<p><strong>You have a résumé that looks like everyone else&#8217;s résumé.</strong> This one is absolutely crazy to me. Your résumé should be as creative as you are. At the least, consider changing the layout from the standard template you downloaded online or copied from your friend who got it from a friend. Use some graphics. Google &#8220;creative résumé designs&#8221; and get inspired. Take a graphic designer friend to lunch and get their feedback. Do something that isn&#8217;t boring.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re too conservative in the interview.</strong> The one time you don&#8217;t want to be careful is when you&#8217;re interviewing. This is the chance to throw out bold ideas and suggestions. If you seem boring when you apply and you get hired, people will expect you to always be that boring. And if the interviewers don&#8217;t like you speaking up, are you really going to like that job anyway?</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t be boring. Because, you&#8217;re not boring. You&#8217;re interesting. Just don&#8217;t forget to show it!</p>

<p><strong>My anywhere? A coffee shop. </strong></p>
<p>I love coffee. And I love being around people. Even when I had the okay from my boss to work from home, there is something that happens when I dress to go out, and open up my laptop somewhere aside from the place I slept that night. When I walk in a comfy little coffee shop with a friendly barista and the smell of fresh roasted beans wafting through the air, something in my brain seems to click on and say “Now it’s time for work!”</p>
<p>As a writer, I get inspiration from the world around me. The world is simply bigger when I step outside my door. At any given coffee shop in any Indy neighborhood, I see a cross-section of life: Sharp looking men in equally sharp business suits, young moms with their jogging strollers, the student with Butler emblazoned on her laptop clearly lost in the music her headphones are piping into her head, the young hipster-ish man who orders a coffee with an extra shot. </p>
<p>When I see people, and often talk with them, it’s inspiring. It sparks questions, sometimes answers, and always creativity. </p>
<p>I’ve hit three coffee shops in one day once. “<a href="http://www.accelawork.com/productivity-through-workplace-popcorn/">Popcorn worker</a>” is a term I’ve recently discovered, and it was with a huge sigh of relief. I thought I was the only one who enjoyed getting out of the house, re-packing and unpacking my laptop throughout the day as I moved from space to space. For me, it provides little mental breaks and productivity boosters that keep me moving effectively through my day. </p>
<p><strong>And isn’t productivity what it’s all about? </strong></p>
<p>Just as everyone has a different learning style, everyone has different ways of being productive. That’s as different as our personalities. </p>
<p>I work better when I can move a little. (And honestly, I think today’s workers don’t move enough.  <a href="http://www.remoteleadershipinstitute.com/exercise/" target="_blank">Weaving exercise</a> into your workday is vital.) So as long as I stay away from the high-calorie drinks and treats at every coffee shop I frequent, it is actually energizing to get in my car and go from place to place.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t like coffee? </strong></p>
<p>Coffee is not the point here – finding your own sweet spot for where you are most productive is. If your employer is open to you working out of the office either full or part time, there are many other options: libraries, shared workspaces, even the food court at the local mall. One of my favorite places? A little greasy spoon 24-hr diner, Peppy&#8217;s Grill in Fountain Square, that just happens to have super fast wifi. </p>
<p><strong>One piece of advice</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to patronize the establishment you are plopping yourself at for a while. I don’t know if there’s a perfect formula, but do buy something. That is the courteous thing to do if you’re using their business for your workspace. Maybe even do a shout-out from time to time on social media for them. Build relationships wherever you go. </p>
<p>And please – if you find a new coffee spot in Indianapolis, let me know. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a television buff, head over to TV Tropes for an explanation of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DismissingACompliment">Dismissing a Compliment</a>.  But in any case, here&#8217;s what this sounds like when someone looking for work is at a networking event or a career fair:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Jobseeker: I hear your company is a great place to work!<br />
Representative: Uh, yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p>Jobseeker: It would be a honor to get an interview!<br />
Representative: Uh, yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p>Jobseeker: I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re interested in someone like me.<br />
Representative: Uh, yeah. Thanks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why should&#8217;t you say something that blithely shows adoration for a company when you&#8217;re looking for work? I&#8217;ve got three reasons.</p>
<h3>Vague Compliments are Hard to Process</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re not particularly good as a society at dealing with people saying nice things to us. It&#8217;s even worse when we are being praised in a way that&#8217;s non-specific. </p>
<p>If you tell someone they look nice, they can&#8217;t say much but &#8220;thank you.&#8221; And for many people, that seems awkward.</p>
<p>If you tell someone you like their shoes, they can at least tell you where they got them. </p>
<p>Therefore, instead of saying &#8220;I&#8217;d love to work for ABC Incorporated!&#8221; try saying &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard ABC Incorporated has an innovative employee mentoring program; can you tell me about it?&#8221;</p>
<h3>Compliments are Often Self-Deprecating</h3>
<p>If you want a job with a company, then you shouldn&#8217;t put that firm on a pedestal. Instead, you need to see if their talents and needs are well matched with your talents and needs. You&#8217;re not interviewing to be a loyal subject of a king, but rather to join a team and play a critical role. </p>
<p>Not all compliments put ourselves down, but they often do. Avoid saying them if you don&#8217;t mean them!</p>
<h3>Everyone Else is Doing It</h3>
<p>If I&#8217;ve heard jobseekers drop these phrases countless times, then that means it&#8217;s a popular technique. And if there&#8217;s one thing you <a href="http://www.indyatwork.com/2015/06/setting-yourself-apart-from-other-jobseekers/">should not do it&#8217;s what everyone else is doing.</a></p>
<p>Set yourself apart by being different. Don&#8217;t blindly say the same things you hear all the time.</p>
<p>Watch out for flattery, whether it comes from your own mouth or those around you. Real conversations are more about ideas than generic praise. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of starting a small business, or more importantly, expanding it from where it is today to where you want to be, there are a few options to consider. Here are the main choices:</p>
<h3>Raise Your Prices</h3>
<p>If you sell your products or services for more money, and your volume doesn&#8217;t decrease more than the difference, you&#8217;ll generate more net revenue that you can plow into growing the company. The math on this is pretty easy: Say you sell 100 widgets a week at $1 each and raise your prices to $2 a widget. As long as you sell more than 50 widgets, you&#8217;ll make more money overall.</p>
<h3>Lower Your Prices</h3>
<p>This one can be counter intuitive. How could dropping your prices help you grow your business? This is really a case of increasing your customer base enough to make it up in volume. Again, consider selling 100 widgets a week at $1 and dropping the price to only 50 cents each. If you can now sell more than 200 a week, you are making more revenue overall.</p>
<h3>Lower Your Costs</h3>
<p>In both previous examples, we didn&#8217;t talk about the difference between net revenue and gross revenue. Obviously it&#8217;s not free for you to make or do whatever you do, but you may be able to do it more inexpensively. Perhaps you can change suppliers or get them to reduce the price you pay. Maybe you can work with fewer employees or negotiate lower rent. Maybe your accountant knows about tax incentives. There are lots of ways to reduce your costs, and make more with the difference.</p>
<h3>Change Your Market Offerings</h3>
<p>This one can go in either direction, Perhaps you need to present a <strong>wider variety</strong> of products to the marketplace so you can make more money in different areas. Or, maybe you would benefit from offering <strong>fewer distinct</strong> items to your customers&#8212;the &#8220;do one thing, do it well&#8221; strategy. In either case, you may be able to better maximize your returns.</p>
<h3>Seek Additional Financial Resources</h3>
<p>A popular option is to leverage your assets to bring more money into the company, and use this to grow. You can go for a straight loan from individuals or other businesses. If you issue invoices and your clients are slow to pay, you can use a factoring service who will &#8220;buy&#8221; the invoice from you at a reduced rate and collect on your behalf. You can also go after old debts using a collections service.</p>
<p>And if your company has non-cash assets, such as real estate, inventory, or equipment, you can often use the inherit value in these to get cash. This can be through a sale or through other financing instruments. In all cases, talk to your accountant.</p>
<h3>Work Smarter or Harder</h3>
<p>Lastly, no discussion about growing a business is complete without mentioning that you can work harder or smarter. Increases in efficiency or increases in effort can both bring in more money. That might be a couple of additional hours of sales calls. Or better yet, sales training to make your selling more effective.
