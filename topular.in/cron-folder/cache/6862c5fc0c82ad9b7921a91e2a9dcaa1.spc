<strong>Race 5: Davona Dale Stakes (GII), three-year-old fillies, one mile on the dirt, post time 1:56pm EST</strong>

The Davona Dale Stakes has been run at Gulfstream since 1988 in honour of Davona Dale.  Davona Dale was a force of nature in 1979, at the age of three.  She won eight consecutive starts during that year, a streak that began with a victory in the Bonnie Miss Stakes at Gulfstream.  (The Bonnie Miss is now run as the Gulfstream Park Oaks.)  During that eight-win tear, Davona Dale won five Grade I races: the Fantasy, the Kentucky Oaks, the Acorn, the Mother Goose, and the Coaching Club American Oaks.  She was voted the Eclipse Award winner for Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, and inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1985, her first year of eligibility.

Thus far, no winner of the Davona Dale has gone on to win the Kentucky Oaks.  Four, however, have gone on to win the Gulfstream Park Oaks (née Bonnie Miss) after taking this race: Glitter Woman (1997), Three Ring (1999), Cash Run (2000), and Justwhistledixie (2009).  Justwhistledixie has also distinguished herself in the breeding shed: she produced 2013 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner New Year's Day, as well as the likely favourite in this year's Fountain of Youth, Mohaymen.

<em>Onlyforyou posts a commanding victory in the 2014 Davona Dale Stakes (GII), the final race of her undefeated and tragically short career. Third-place Aurelia's Belle proved better on polytrack and dirt, and won the Arlington Oaks that summer. Stopchargingmaria, the 2015 Breeders' Cup Distaff winner, finished fifth.</em>

This year's renewal of the Davona Dale offers a $200,000 purse, and Road to the Kentucky Oaks points (50-20-10-5) to its top four.  Previously, in the Forward Gal, this space took a strong stand against CATHRYN SOPHIA.  At that point, she had not proven herself off the lead, and she had not proven herself against this class of horses.  That afternoon, she proved all of that and then some.  She did not get the early lead, she ran into trip trouble, but she still rallied to win easily in hand.  She proved she was the goods.

That level of versatility will help CATHRYN SOPHIA here, as R GIRLS A CHARMER needs the lead, and RONTOS LILY's only particularly good effort came on the lead as well.  Longshot BAGEMA stretches out, and has shown speed; a "send-and-see" strategy may be the only one for a horse in so far over her head on paper.  THRILLED also goes blinkers-on for the first time here, and could show more speed than before.  With the knowledge that CATHRYN SOPHIA can sit off, handle the Gulfstream track, and handle adversity, combined with the fact that she is so consistently fast compared to this field, this space takes a "if you can't beat them, join them" attitude toward her.  The biggest question is the fact that she has never done a mile before.  But, she does have seven-furlong form at Gulfstream, and a Street Boss baby out of a Mineshaft mare has every right to relish one more furling.  CATHRYN SOPHIA will not be value in the win pool -- with the likes of LEWIS BAY, THRILLED, and R GIRLS A CHARMER she may be more like 3/5 than 1/9, but that's the extent of the price this space figures to get.  That said, this space would single her, and sees no use in getting cute.

A pair of layoff types, LEWIS BAY and THRILLED, have every chance to hit the board.  LEWIS BAY races for the first time since her victory in the Demoiselle (GII) last November.  However, she has been on the worktab since early January, and trainer Chad Brown fires at 28% with runners laid off 90 days or more.  LEWIS BAY cuts back from nine furlongs last out, but has a seven-furlong win to break her maiden.  That suggests the one-turn mile could be within her abilities.  She would have to take a huge step forward first off the lay to beat CATHRYN SOPHIA, but even a return to her two-year-old firm should get her a share against this set.  THRILLED, the Todd Pletcher entry, also has a chance at a "second to CATHRYN SOPHIA" medal here.  She makes her first start since the Demoiselle as well; that time out, she stalked the pace and stayed on to finish a clear second behind LEWIS BAY.  That try was her first on dirt.  Like LEWIS BAY, her trainer is also a solid lay conditioner: Pletcher wins 27% of the time with runners laid off for 90 days or longer.  THRILLED does go first-time blinkers here.  Between that and the pattern of bullet works leading into this race, expect her to show some speed early.  That could get thorny with R GIRLS A CHARMER and company in the field, and is why LEWIS BAY get slotted just above THRILLED.  Still, THRILLED has a rating gear and an ability to dig in, and therefore has a shot at a share.

The one horse to take a stand against is R GIRLS A CHARMER.  Yes, she has a win at Gulfstream, and she has an extended-sprint win at Tampa.  But, she is one-way speed, and she is likely to get some competition as outlined above.  Her pedigree also suggests she may not like the extra furlong very much: she is by sprinter In Summation, and from a female family where all the class comes at short distances.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  For anyone determined to swing against CATHRYN SOPHIA in the win pool, DEAREST may have as good of a chance as LEWIS BAY or THRILLED, but at a much better price given that she doesn't come from a national name-brand barn like Brown or Pletcher.  Trainer Gilberto Zarpa has been choosy with his spots this Gulfstream meet: eight starts, but two wins and another money finish to show for it.  DEAREST herself has two wins in two starts, and is the only one in the field with Brisnet speed figures truly on par with CATHRYN SOPHIA.  In terms of style, she has a stalking style that should keep her within range, but give her no need to burn herself chasing R GIRLS A CHARMER early.  She has to prove herself in classier company, since this is her stakes debut.  But, she has only started twice, and is second off the lay.  She has every right to improve.  DEAREST also has local extended-sprint form, with an allowance win going seven furlongs over the Gulfstream track.  Her dam won going as long as a mile, suggesting DEAREST may stretch out here.  No matter what, DEAREST belongs in the exotics, and she has more merit than anyone for those who like to be speculative or contrarian with a win bet.

<strong>Race 12: Fountain of Youth Stakes (GII), three-year-olds, one and one sixteenth miles on the dirt, post time 5:30pm EST</strong>

The Fountain of Youth Stakes takes its name from the legendary Fountain of Youth.  Some have placed it in Abkhazia, others Bimini, and cooler (or less whimsical) heads have claimed it never existed at all.  Spanish conquistador Ponce de León gained royal charter to search for the lands of Beniny, where that fountain was rumoured to exist.  He never found it...but he did reach the coast of Florida, including perhaps an area (with a spring) that eventually became St. Augustine.

The Fountain of Youth has been run since 1945, with gaps in 1946, 1948, and 1952.  It was a Grade III beginning 1973, and then upgraded to a GII in 1982.  It has kept that designation ever since, except for 1999-2003 when it was a GI.  It has been run at distances between a mile and a mile and an eighth, though has been as its current mile and a sixteenth for most of its history (1953-2004, 2012-present).  Fortunately, Florida's search for Kentucky Derby winners has been a bit more fruitful than de León's search for the waters of eternal life.  To date, the Fountain of Youth has produced five horses who wore the roses on the first Saturday in May: Tim Tam (1958), Kauai King (1966), Spectacular Bid (1979), Thunder Gulch (1995), Orb (2013).  Of more local relevance, onetime Arlington stakes namesake Sea O Erin won the Fountain of Youth in 1954.  He was a stakes winner at Arlington, Hawthorne, and Washington Park during his career.

<em>Built for Pleasure surprised a few people -- Tom Durkin included -- when he won the 1996 Fountain of Youth at 143/1 odds. Eventual Belmont Stakes winner Editor's Note crossed the wire fifth.</em>

This year's renewal of the Fountain of Youth Stakes offers a $400,000 purse, as well as Road to the Kentucky Derby points (50-20-10-5) to horses placed in the top four.  MOHAYMEN will likely be the heavy favourite, particularly after his facile win last out over this same course and distance in the Holy Bull Stakes (GII).  Unfortunately for those seeking a price, MOHAYMEN looks like the goods.  He has never looked like he has had to try too hard to go as fast or faster than these.  He can get at least this distance, and we have not seen his bottom.  Furthermore, the pace should set up well for him.  AWESOME BANNER and GOLDEN RAY will most certainly send, AWESOME SPEED should not be far off, and even ZULU has been known to want a piece of the front-end action.  MOHAYMEN will not be far off the pace, but he does not stand to get locked into a duel.  Leave it to MOHAYMEN to do what he has done several times before: wait for Junior Alvarado to push the button, and roll past the early speed.

This space considered tabbing ZULU for the upset, but could not quite come up with enough despite the short price likely on the favourite.  Though stepping up to outperform MOHAYMEN Saturday would be an extremely tall order for ZULU, he has more upside than anyone to take a big step forward.  He is the most lightly-raced runner in the field, having only started twice.  Both of those starts came at Gulfstream, and both were victories.  The speed figures are also encouraging, as both are in range of what MOHAYMEN has shown.  Though the last came over slop, his debut was over a dry track; Saturday's fast going should be fine.  This will be ZULU's first try at a route, but there are suggestions that he will get there.  He is by Bernardini, a solid dirt route sire.  On bottom, he is out of Temporada.  That Summer Squall mare may be familiar to dutiful followers of local racing -- after all, she produced star Illinois-bred sprinter Third Chance (Kafwain).  However, five of her nine winners to date have had their pictures taken going a mile or more; she can produce routers, too.

For a third choice, there were two credible candidates from the Stanley Gold barn: AWESOME BANNER and FELLOWSHIP.  Pay attention to how the track plays Saturday.  If a serious speed bias unfolds, given AWESOME BANNER a plus-factor as speed of the speed in a short field, particularly given his ability to survive a pressured pace.  However, should the track be playing at least moderately fairly, the "Gold B" FELLOWSHIP appeals a bit more.  His form at a mile and a sixteenth has been excellent.  He won a Florida-sired stakes at this distance over the Gulfstream main last summer.  Then, last out, he finished third in the Holy Bull as a 40/1 bomber.  Though he was last early in a field of six, behind a slow pace, he still rallied well enough to get up for third behind MOHAYMEN that day.  FELLOWSHIP will almost certainly see more pace in this race, making his strong late pace attractive.  Though turning the tables on the favourite seems a bridge too far, hitting the board at a price once again is within FELLOWSHIP's grasp.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#6 MOHAYMEN</strong>

<strong>#2 ZULU</strong>

<strong>#1 FELLOWSHIP</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span> The longshot writer is firmly ensconced in the PPs for the nightcap: a maiden special weight with twice as many entries as this race, plus a couple of also-eligibles.

The Fountain of Youth has been run since 1945, with gaps in 1946, 1948, and 1952.  It was a Grade III beginning 1973, and then upgraded to a GII in 1982.  It has kept that designation ever since, except for 1999-2003 when it was a GI.  It has been run at distances between a mile and a mile and an eighth, though has been as its current mile and a sixteenth for most of its history (1953-2004, 2012-present).  Fortunately, Florida's search for Kentucky Derby winners has been a bit more fruitful than de León's search for the waters of eternal life.  To date, the Fountain of Youth has produced five horses who wore the roses on the first Saturday in May: Tim Tam (1958), Kauai King (1966), Spectacular Bid (1979), Thunder Gulch (1995), Orb (2013).  Of more local relevance, onetime Arlington stakes namesake Sea O Erin won the Fountain of Youth in 1954.  He was a stakes winner at Arlington, Hawthorne, and Washington Park during his career.

<em>Built for Pleasure surprised a few people -- Tom Durkin included -- when he won the 1996 Fountain of Youth at 143/1 odds. Eventual Belmont Stakes winner Editor's Note crossed the wire fifth.</em>

This year's renewal of the Fountain of Youth Stakes offers a $400,000 purse, as well as Road to the Kentucky Derby points (50-20-10-5) to horses placed in the top four.  MOHAYMEN will likely be the heavy favourite, particularly after his facile win last out over this same course and distance in the Holy Bull Stakes (GII).  Unfortunately for those seeking a price, MOHAYMEN looks like the goods.  He has never looked like he has had to try too hard to go as fast or faster than these.  He can get at least this distance, and we have not seen his bottom.  Furthermore, the pace should set up well for him.  AWESOME BANNER and GOLDEN RAY will most certainly send, AWESOME SPEED should not be far off, and even ZULU has been known to want a piece of the front-end action.  MOHAYMEN will not be far off the pace, but he does not stand to get locked into a duel.  Leave it to MOHAYMEN to do what he has done several times before: wait for Junior Alvarado to push the button, and roll past the early speed.

This space considered tabbing ZULU for the upset, but could not quite come up with enough despite the short price likely on the favourite.  Though stepping up to outperform MOHAYMEN Saturday would be an extremely tall order for ZULU, he has more upside than anyone to take a big step forward.  He is the most lightly-raced runner in the field, having only started twice.  Both of those starts came at Gulfstream, and both were victories.  The speed figures are also encouraging, as both are in range of what MOHAYMEN has shown.  Though the last came over slop, his debut was over a dry track; Saturday's fast going should be fine.  This will be ZULU's first try at a route, but there are suggestions that he will get there.  He is by Bernardini, a solid dirt route sire.  On bottom, he is out of Temporada.  That Summer Squall mare may be familiar to dutiful followers of local racing -- after all, she produced star Illinois-bred sprinter Third Chance (Kafwain).  However, five of her nine winners to date have had their pictures taken going a mile or more; she can produce routers, too.

For a third choice, there were two credible candidates from the Stanley Gold barn: AWESOME BANNER and FELLOWSHIP.  Pay attention to how the track plays Saturday.  If a serious speed bias unfolds, given AWESOME BANNER a plus-factor as speed of the speed in a short field, particularly given his ability to survive a pressured pace.  However, should the track be playing at least moderately fairly, the "Gold B" FELLOWSHIP appeals a bit more.  His form at a mile and a sixteenth has been excellent.  He won a Florida-sired stakes at this distance over the Gulfstream main last summer.  Then, last out, he finished third in the Holy Bull as a 40/1 bomber.  Though he was last early in a field of six, behind a slow pace, he still rallied well enough to get up for third behind MOHAYMEN that day.  FELLOWSHIP will almost certainly see more pace in this race, making his strong late pace attractive.  Though turning the tables on the favourite seems a bridge too far, hitting the board at a price once again is within FELLOWSHIP's grasp.

<em><strong>Aqueduct  -- Race 8 -- Busher Stakes -- One and one-sixteenth miles on Inner Dirt -- post time 4:50 pm ET</strong></em>

For a seven horse field, this race came up with a projected contested pace.  Perhaps that pace as well as a rider switch are the ticket for DREAMS TO REALITY, whose Busanda stakes feeatured a wide trip and a middling fourth place finish.  Switching back to an inside post should do the trick here, as well as a switch to Kendrick Carmouche - a top five local rider - for a pilot, should help here.  The Michael Dilger trainee goes second off the shelf after graduating last December in a maiden claimer going a single-turn mile and had the wide trip in the Busanda.  They also went fairly slow in the Busanda as LOST RAVEN carved out  a :49 half that day.  The pace projects more lively with LOST RAVEN back in the box as well as stretchout WHISTLING STRAITS.  Such a contested pace should help ARCH OR NOTHING, whose Busanda was even worse as the rider fell.  ARCH OR NOTHING got her diploma two back over the inner oval and like DREAMS TO REALITY makes the second start of the layoff.  Like DREAMS TO REALITY, her year started in the Busanda.  Behind a tough-to-separate pair, this space slots the Busanda winner third.  FLORA DORA moves to the outside post this go-round.  While she showed she can press off a more modest piece, she'll have to work out a trip from an outermost post seven.  The slight added distance (from a mile and seventy to a mile and a sixteenth) may help this cause, but she isn't going to clear to the front with WHISTLING STRAITS in this field on the stretchout.  Things won't be the same this go-round, but she's earned respect.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#3 DREAMS TO REALITY</strong>

<strong>#4 ARCH OR NOTHING</strong>

<strong>#7 FLORA DORA</strong>

Longshot: <strong>#1 LOST RAVEN</strong> is one of two from Todd Pletcher's shedrow of sophomores, and she was the one who cut out the pace last time in the Busanda.  Manny Franco has the return call on this filly that won a sprint stakes at second asking last fall at Laurel and two back got on the podium in a three-year-old stakes at Laurel.  Maybe Laurel is better to her, but she doesn't need to the lead despite being part of the pace.  If the Aqueduct Inner Dirt suddenly carries inside speed she has more than a puncher's chance.  Regardless, she projects as the pace - but her gameness and her not needing the lead will keep around longer than the usual one-way speed.

Things got underway with a pair of ten-point preps last month, the LeComte (GIII) and the Silverbulletday.  They up the ante this time around with the Risen Star for Derby-bound types, and the Rachel Alexandra for the fillies.  Not only are both Grade II affairs, but they are the first of the fifty-point prep races anywhere in the country.  Both are a mile and a sixteenth, and both should yield some clues about which runners will be able to handle longer distances through the spring.  Each is also the second race in a three-part prep season at Fair Grounds.  Both series conclude on March 26, with the Louisiana Derby (GII) for open sophomores, and the Fair Grounds Oaks (GII) for fillies.

<strong>Race 9: Twinspires.com Rachel Alexandra Stakes (GII), three-year-old fillies, one and one sixteenth miles on the dirt, post time 4:23pm CST</strong>

First run in 1982 as the Davona Dale Stakes, the race was renamed for Silverbulletday in 2001, then named for Rachel Alexandra in 2011.  It was run at a mile and forty yards in its first three editions, and then stretched to its current mile and a sixteenth distance.  It has been a Grade III since 1999.  Rachel Alexandra never won the race named in her honour.  But, she did win the Fair Grounds Oaks (GII) in 2009 on her way to a dominant 20 1/4 length win in the Kentucky Oaks (GI) , and then beat males in the Preakness (GI), Haskell (GI), and Woodward (GI) later that year.  Over its history, the Rachel Alexandra has been a productive source of Kentucky Oaks winners.  Six winners of this race have taken home the blanket of lilies: Tiffany Lass (1986), Blushing K. D. (1997), Silverbulletday (1999), Summerly (2005), Believe You Can (2012), and Untapable (2014).  Another of the most notable winners of this race fell a length and a quarter short in the Kentucky Oaks.  Take Charge Lady (2002) won eight graded stakes, including the 2003 Arlington Matron.  As a producer, she already has two champions on her direct female line: she is the dam of Will Take Charge (2013 Champion Three Year Old Male), and the second dam of Take Charge Brandi (2014 Champion Two Year Old Filly, via her daughter Charming).

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tArYV2zcVs" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<em>Untapable begins her three-year-old campaign with a victory in the 2014 Rachel Alexandra Stakes.</em>

The Rachel Alexandra Stakes is the first race to offer 50 points to its winner, as well as 20, 10, and 5 points to the next three placings.  As such, whoever wins this race virtually assures herself a spot in the starting gate on Oaks day should her connections opt to go, and the second-place finisher has likely punched her ticket as well.  In addition, the race offers a $200,000 purse -- up $25,000 from last year's lucre.  This year's edition drew a fiield of nine to contest for those spoils.

<strong></strong>This space tries as hard as it can to find alternatives to chalk, given how much one must demand of a runner to take a short price.  This space also gives enhanced scrutiny to sons and daughters of Curlin, as it would be unfair for its well-documented love of that sire to translate into foolhardy selections.  Given all of this, this space searched high and low for a way to beat 7/5 morning line favourite STAGEPLAY in the Rachel Alexandra.

This space failed to find one.

You know what you're getting with STAGEPLAY, as much as one can know what they are getting with a three-year-old.  In four starts she has won three times, including a comfortable Silverbulletday stakes victory at two turns over this same course.  On figures, she has put up a 91 BRIS in all four of her starts -- in other words, dependably putting up speed figures that are (or would be) one-off tops for the rest of the field.  The only time she has lost was in the Golden Rod -- behind a very good horse in Carina Mia.  There is no Carina Mia in this field.  Also, Carina Mia had things her way on the front in the early stages of this race.  Such a setup is not likely here. Stretch-out type FINLEY'SLUCKYCHARM likely sets the pace, but MIDNIGHT ON OCONEE (the pacesetter from the Silverbulletday) will not let her off too easily, and LOVABLE LYSS may show speed as well.  STAGEPLAY can run well from a stalking or midpack spot, and 28% Fair Grounds rider Florent Geroux will be smart enough to get STAGEPLAY where she needs to be.  STAGEPLAY looks set to take another step down the Oaks trail this Saturday.

Most intriguing among the rest is STAGEPLAY's stablemate from the Steve Asmussen barn, ROYAL OBSESSION.  This filly tries stakes company for the first time, but has won both of her previous starts.  That includes a main-track mile win at the Fair Grounds last out, when she rallied sharply into a soft pace to nail LEMON DROP BELLE.  ROYAL OBSESSION should have no trouble with the extra sixteenth of a mile off of that last race, either.  She is by Tapit, out of a Tiznow half-sister to GI-winning turf router Magnificent Song.  Though she loses rider Florent Geroux to STAGEPLAY, she is in capable hands with rider John Velazquez, a winner a quarter of the time in route races.  ROYAL OBSESSION will have to take a step up to beat this company, but she is lightly raced enough to have that upside, and the late zip she showed last out should serve her well whether FINLEY'SLUCKYCHARM gets only a little early pressure, or a lot.

It can be hard to count out a Larry Jones filly this time of year, particularly at the Fair Grounds.  He has an honest one in MIDNIGHT ON OCONEE.  She set the early fractions in the Silverbulletday, and though she was no match for STAGEPLAY, she kept fighting, and stayed on to finish a clear second.  Her maiden and allowance wins suggest that she does not truly need the lead -- good indications to have, with FINLEY'SLUCKYCHARM in the field.  Though winning may be a tall order for MIDNIGHT IN OCONEE, this filly has shown enough fight -- and enough affinity for the Fair Grounds oval -- that she should be around for a share come the wire.

Two who deserve a brief mention are FOREVER DARLING and LOVABLE LYSS.  Forever Darling did win the Santa Ynez nicely, and her pedigree suggests trying two turns again should be worth a shot.  However, she will be a fairly short price off that last effort, and trainer Richard Baltas's dull record with shippers makes her hard to take in this attempt to dodge Songbird.  LOVABLE LYSS was dazzling in her first two tries over the Fair Grounds course, but finished fourth with no apparent excuse last out.  She entered the Martha Washington, but scratched and entered here instead.  If she runs back to her dazzling efforts earlier in the meet, she contends.  This space will not dissuade anyone from taking a flyer if she drifts to boxcar odds, but that last out was enough of a red flag to make this space (which was once so bullish on her) take a pass.

<strong>Race 11: Veterans Ford Risen Star Stakes (GII), three-year-olds, one and one sixteenth miles on the dirt, post time 5:21pm CST</strong>

<em>This portion of the piece is jointly submitted for <a href="http://www.thorofan.com/">Thorofan's</a> Handicapper's Corner.</em>

The feature of the Fair Grounds card for February 20th is the  $400,000 G2 Risen Star Stakes.  A 50-20-10-5 dispersal of Kentucky Derby points is at stake, meaning that (based on past trends) the top two finishers have spots in the Kentucky Derby gate should they want them.  The race honors Risen Star, a son of Secretariat out of Ribbon mare His Majesty that won the Louisiana Derby, Lexington, Preakness, and Belmont in his sophomore campaign in 1988.  His Belmont saw him win in 2:26 2/5, a tick faster than the most recent Triple Crown winner - American Pharoah.  Perhaps time may only matter in jail (you never know if the surface was a speedway), but Risen Star's work from New Orleans to New York made him that year's champion three-year-old.  The stakes that bears his name started as the Louisiana Derby Trial in 1973, and made the name change to Risen Star in 1989.  The final local prep to the Louisiana Derby, it has yet to yield a Kentucky Derby winner but has produced two Preakness winners: Master Derby (1975) and Risen Star (1988). Veterans Ford, a New Orleans-based car dealer, is sponsoring this year's Risen Star.

<em>Risen Star, this race's namesake, demolishes the field in the 1988 Belmont Stakes.</em>

A lot of handicappers talk about flattering races.  That the performance of horse X flatters race Y, that if so-and-so does well, the race looks better.  It goes the other way too, and the key race (or anti-key race) if one can spot it before the others can be a fruitful angle.  A lot of this talk emerged when Destin, who was fourth in the G3 Lecomte behind MO TOM, TOM's READY,and UNCLE WALTER, won the Davis in a snappy clock time.  So Destin supposedly flattered the LeComte and by this reasoning the 1-2-3 of the LeComte are going to prevail yet again.  To this observer, flattery will get you nowhere.  The argument glosses over the idea that these are maturing horses who grow in spurts.  It also glosses over that the 1-2-3 finishers had great pedigrees for a mile and seventy, but whose distance limitations grow as the races extend.  With the familiar foes having questions, the new shooters start to appeal.  But the highest profile on them is AIROFORCE, who splashed to a G2 triumph on Thanksgiving weekend in the Kentucky Jockey Club.  But can he transfer his work to dry dirt?  He has every chance based on breeding but at 5/2 morning line presents a price that doesn't inspire.

While the field of fourteen guarantees a pace that's honest, perhaps this is the time to take an off-the-pace type.  In a field where the 1-2-3 of the local prior prep may find the distance wanting, perhaps this is the time to take a new shooter.  GUN RUNNER appeals more, as he was fourth in the G2 Kentucky Jockey Club and set the pace that AIROFORCE rallied into.  The flammable Florent Geroux has the assigned mount for Steve Asmussen.  GUN RUNNER, two back, when the pace was more moderate ran evenly and made a sustained rally, finishing in front of a then-unknown Rafting.  GUN RUNNER could be keen first off the layoff and repeat his KJC where he does too much early.  But the better tactic is to try to make one rally, pull back, and let someone like BISTRAYA or IT'S ALL RELEVANT do the dirty work.  Whatever the case, perhaps GUN RUNNER can move forward and surprise.  The big question in this race is if AIROFORCE can extend his turf and sloppy dirt form to a fast, dry track.  If he can he'll be intriguing to follow on the Kentucky Derby trail.  His work on grass is fine enough, with a win in the G3 Bourbon and a neck defeat in the G1 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf speaking for that.   There should be enough pace to help AIROFORCE, and his breeding indicates dry dirt isn't an issue.  The big question remains, but asking big questions at small prices isn't a great idea and while he could win he 's defensively used in this space.  Everyone's favorite race to flatter, the LeComte, sees the third place finisher TOM'S READY get a mention here.  Even though he's finished behind stablemate MO TOM three times already, perhaps he'll get better as the distances increase.  He's better bred for a mile and a sixteenth on paper than his stablemate, but perhaps (like in the LeComte) the future is now for MO TOM.  Three seconds in the last four starts might point to a stuck in neutral type, or someone who needs the clearest trip from the outside stall and has had obstacles along the way.  He deserves a chance at the longer distance.

Things got underway with a pair of ten-point preps last month, the LeComte (GIII) and the Silverbulletday.  They up the ante this time around with the Risen Star for Derby-bound types, and the Rachel Alexandra for the fillies.  Not only are both Grade II affairs, but they are the first of the fifty-point prep races anywhere in the country.  Both are a mile and a sixteenth, and both should yield some clues about which runners will be able to handle longer distances through the spring.  Each is also the second race in a three-part prep season at Fair Grounds.  Both series conclude on March 26, with the Louisiana Derby (GII) for open sophomores, and the Fair Grounds Oaks (GII) for fillies.

<em>All races are scheduled for Saturday, February 20 at Fair Grounds Race Course.  Authors of each race preview are denoted at the end: PM for Paul Mazur, NN for Nicolle Neulist.</em>

<strong>Race 9: Twinspires.com Rachel Alexandra Stakes (GII), three-year-old fillies, one and one sixteenth miles on the dirt, post time 4:23pm CST</strong>

First run in 1982 as the Davona Dale Stakes, the race was renamed for Silverbulletday in 2001, then named for Rachel Alexandra in 2011.  It was run at a mile and forty yards in its first three editions, and then stretched to its current mile and a sixteenth distance.  It has been a Grade III since 1999.  Rachel Alexandra never won the race named in her honour.  But, she did win the Fair Grounds Oaks (GII) in 2009 on her way to a dominant 20 1/4 length win in the Kentucky Oaks (GI) , and then beat males in the Preakness (GI), Haskell (GI), and Woodward (GI) later that year.  Over its history, the Rachel Alexandra has been a productive source of Kentucky Oaks winners.  Six winners of this race have taken home the blanket of lilies: Tiffany Lass (1986), Blushing K. D. (1997), Silverbulletday (1999), Summerly (2005), Believe You Can (2012), and Untapable (2014).  Another of the most notable winners of this race fell a length and a quarter short in the Kentucky Oaks.  Take Charge Lady (2002) won eight graded stakes, including the 2003 Arlington Matron.  As a producer, she already has two champions on her direct female line: she is the dam of Will Take Charge (2013 Champion Three Year Old Male), and the second dam of Take Charge Brandi (2014 Champion Two Year Old Filly, via her daughter Charming).

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tArYV2zcVs" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<em>Untapable begins her three-year-old campaign with a victory in the 2014 Rachel Alexandra Stakes.</em>

The Rachel Alexandra Stakes is the first race to offer 50 points to its winner, as well as 20, 10, and 5 points to the next three placings.  As such, whoever wins this race virtually assures herself a spot in the starting gate on Oaks day should her connections opt to go, and the second-place finisher has likely punched her ticket as well.  In addition, the race offers a $200,000 purse -- up $25,000 from last year's lucre.  This year's edition drew a fiield of nine to contest for those spoils.

<strong></strong>This space tries as hard as it can to find alternatives to chalk, given how much one must demand of a runner to take a short price.  This space also gives enhanced scrutiny to sons and daughters of Curlin, as it would be unfair for its well-documented love of that sire to translate into foolhardy selections.  Given all of this, this space searched high and low for a way to beat 7/5 morning line favourite STAGEPLAY in the Rachel Alexandra.

This space failed to find one.

You know what you're getting with STAGEPLAY, as much as one can know what they are getting with a three-year-old.  In four starts she has won three times, including a comfortable Silverbulletday stakes victory at two turns over this same course.  On figures, she has put up a 91 BRIS in all four of her starts -- in other words, dependably putting up speed figures that are (or would be) one-off tops for the rest of the field.  The only time she has lost was in the Golden Rod -- behind a very good horse in Carina Mia.  There is no Carina Mia in this field.  Also, Carina Mia had things her way on the front in the early stages of this race.  Such a setup is not likely here. Stretch-out type FINLEY'SLUCKYCHARM likely sets the pace, but MIDNIGHT ON OCONEE (the pacesetter from the Silverbulletday) will not let her off too easily, and LOVABLE LYSS may show speed as well.  STAGEPLAY can run well from a stalking or midpack spot, and 28% Fair Grounds rider Florent Geroux will be smart enough to get STAGEPLAY where she needs to be.  STAGEPLAY looks set to take another step down the Oaks trail this Saturday.

Most intriguing among the rest is STAGEPLAY's stablemate from the Steve Asmussen barn, ROYAL OBSESSION.  This filly tries stakes company for the first time, but has won both of her previous starts.  That includes a main-track mile win at the Fair Grounds last out, when she rallied sharply into a soft pace to nail LEMON DROP BELLE.  ROYAL OBSESSION should have no trouble with the extra sixteenth of a mile off of that last race, either.  She is by Tapit, out of a Tiznow half-sister to GI-winning turf router Magnificent Song.  Though she loses rider Florent Geroux to STAGEPLAY, she is in capable hands with rider John Velazquez, a winner a quarter of the time in route races.  ROYAL OBSESSION will have to take a step up to beat this company, but she is lightly raced enough to have that upside, and the late zip she showed last out should serve her well whether FINLEY'SLUCKYCHARM gets only a little early pressure, or a lot.

It can be hard to count out a Larry Jones filly this time of year, particularly at the Fair Grounds.  He has an honest one in MIDNIGHT ON OCONEE.  She set the early fractions in the Silverbulletday, and though she was no match for STAGEPLAY, she kept fighting, and stayed on to finish a clear second.  Her maiden and allowance wins suggest that she does not truly need the lead -- good indications to have, with FINLEY'SLUCKYCHARM in the field.  Though winning may be a tall order for MIDNIGHT IN OCONEE, this filly has shown enough fight -- and enough affinity for the Fair Grounds oval -- that she should be around for a share come the wire.

Two who deserve a brief mention are FOREVER DARLING and LOVABLE LYSS.  Forever Darling did win the Santa Ynez nicely, and her pedigree suggests trying two turns again should be worth a shot.  However, she will be a fairly short price off that last effort, and trainer Richard Baltas's dull record with shippers makes her hard to take in this attempt to dodge Songbird.  LOVABLE LYSS was dazzling in her first two tries over the Fair Grounds course, but finished fourth with no apparent excuse last out.  She entered the Martha Washington, but scratched and entered here instead.  If she runs back to her dazzling efforts earlier in the meet, she contends.  This space will not dissuade anyone from taking a flyer if she drifts to boxcar odds, but that last out was enough of a red flag to make this space (which was once so bullish on her) take a pass.

This piece looks at the feature of the President's Day card at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, the Grade Three Southwest Stakes.  A half million dollars of purse funds and a 10-4-2-1 Kentucky Derby point allotment are on the line in the middle prep of Oaklawn's series of feeders that culminate on closing day's G1 Arkansas Derby.  The G3 Southwest Stakes takes its name from the defunct Southwest Conference that the University of Arkansas (along with the University of Texas) resided in for their NCAA athletic programs.  The Southwest Stakes came to life on a regular basis in 1968 (after two one-off runnings in 1959 and 962) as a sprint race and went to two turns in 1983, being run at a short-stretch mile.  The race was stretched out to a mile and a sixteenth in 2013.  The race has been split in divisions three times (most recently in 2012).  Only one horse has parlayed a victory in the Southwest Stakes into an Arkansas Derby triumph  - Smarty Jones (2004), who swept the Southwest-Rebel-Arkansas Derby series that year.  Additional winners of note include Illinois-bred Clever Allemont (1985), champion sprinter Smoke Glacken (1997).

As it seems the speed is concentrated on the inside, it's possible that a ground-saving trip from a inner-to-middle post is what takes the Southwest Stakes.  Perhaps SYNCHRONY  is in the catbird seat at the top of the lane.  The "other" from the Donnie Von Hemel shederow in the field with SUDDENBREAKINGNEWS as the primary runner, he gets out-of-towner Shaun Bridgmohan as assigned rider.  It should be noted that SYNCHRONY and SUDDENBREAKING NEWS are a coupled entry; this space prefers SYNCHRONY's inside draw.   His first stakes try saw him close at the closer-unfriendly mile distance with its short stretch over the local oval in the Smarty Jones stakes.  SYNCHRONY's pedigree (by Tapit out of a Brownie Points mare) indicates that a mile and a sixteeenth should be easily attainable for this hombred.  It's worth noting that Von Hemel conditioned Brownie Points back in the day - so there's familiarity in this runner.  The Smarty Jones was the first try around two turns, and if he can bring the closing kick he demonstrated two back at Churchill, that will be an asset against forward types like COLLECTED and AMERICAN DUBAI that reside closer to the paint.  The connections behind last year's Southwest winner are back this year with WHITMORE.  Mike Smith has been lured to give up mounts on the Santa Anita card to make the trip to Hot Springs on this runner.  A winner last time in a first-level allowance, he was close to the pace two back in the G3 Delta Jackpot and went in neutral turning for home.  Worth noting the second-place finisher of the Jackpot took the Withers.  WHITMORE may be the buzz runner that many are anticipating, but it's worth noting he's never been two turns on a dry oval.  His last race victory was at six panels.  He deserves another chance on dry dirt to strut his stuff, but the chatter on him makes him one to use defensively.   Von Hemel's go-to rider in his Midwest excursions is Luis Quinonez, and he's got the mount on SUDDENBREAKINGNEWS.  He's stuck way out in post thirteen and the draw does him no favors.  However, he won the Clevor Trevor two back at Remington and was in the photo with DISCREETNESS, the same DISCREETNESS that won the Smarty Jones.  Five career starts for SUDDENBREAKINGNEWS are on the resume, and all five have been top two finishes.  The same pace scenario that helps stablemate SYNCRONY helps SUDDENBREAKINGNEWS, but the post is why SUDDENBREAKINGNEWS is demoted.

This piece looks at the feature of the President's Day card at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, the Grade Three Southwest Stakes.  A half million dollars of purse funds and a 10-4-2-1 Kentucky Derby point allotment are on the line in the middle prep of Oaklawn's series of feeders that culminate on closing day's G1 Arkansas Derby.  The G3 Southwest Stakes takes its name from the defunct Southwest Conference that the University of Arkansas (along with the University of Texas) resided in for their NCAA athletic programs.  The Southwest Stakes came to life on a regular basis in 1968 (after two one-off runnings in 1959 and 962) as a sprint race and went to two turns in 1983, being run at a short-stretch mile.  The race was stretched out to a mile and a sixteenth in 2013.  The race has been split in divisions three times (most recently in 2012).  Only one horse has parlayed a victory in the Southwest Stakes into an Arkansas Derby triumph  - Smarty Jones (2004), who swept the Southwest-Rebel-Arkansas Derby series that year.  Additional winners of note include Illinois-bred Clever Allemont (1985), champion sprinter Smoke Glacken (1997).

Lovely Loyree faces graded stakes company for the first time in tomorrow's Endeavour Stakes (GIII), a mile and a sixteenth turf race for fillies and mares.  The daughter of Cactus Ridge, out of the stakes-placed Illinois-bred mare Lil Cora Tee, has been a consistent presence on the Illinois circuit for several seasons now.  In 2014, at age three, she won four races and was twice stakes-placed, including against open sophomore fillies in the Hatoof Stakes.  It was a resume strong enough to win her Champion Illinois-bred Three Year Old Filly honours.  She only raced three times at four, but she finished the year with a decisive victory in the Stickney Handicap.  In her five-year-old debut last month, she finished second in a prep allowance at Tampa.

Lovely Loyree has hit the board in her last ten starts, and enters the Endevour in good form.  Going out to train this morning, Lovely Loyree looked every bit the classy racemare.  Her coat was resplendent, and she was focused on the task at hand.  That appearance fit right in hand with how trainer Michele Boyce described her current training.  "She came out of her last race good, and she’s definitely moving forward.  She’s dappled out.  She doesn’t like the dirt, particularly; it’s a very sandy base.  But, she handled the turf course very nicely, and she’s fit enough for the distance."

Still, the mare faces her toughest class test yet in tomorrow's Endeavour -- a race headlined by last year's Breeders' Cup Mile (GI) winner.  “There’s one in there who looks like such a standout, Tepin," remarked Boyce. "There’s no question about that.  With the others, with the right racing luck, and depending on how the pace sets up, I think she’s got as good a shot as anybody in there."

Once race later in the card, Illinois-bred Missalaney faces eleven other three-year-old fillies and mares in a wide-open renewal of the Suncoast Stakes.  The race covers a mile and forty yards on the dirt.

Missalaney, a daughter of Badge of Silver out of Sarahcarolu, debuted at Arlington in August.  She finished seventh in that polytrack sprint, as well as in a dirt sprint at Hawthorne in October.  Missalaney broke her maiden at third asking, going a mile over the Hawthorne grass.  It was her first try at a route, and her first on turf.  She tracked the pace and kicked clear to win by four and a half authoritative lengths.  Her victory caught the betting public unawares -- she won at odds of 28/1, and keyed a superfecta carryover.  Did it surprise trainer David Hinsley?  "Not really," he noted, "she was bred for it."

Despite her best race at age two coming over grass, Missalaney was training well over the uniquely sandy Tampa Bay dirt.  After an off-the-board finish in a turf allowance there in December, her connections decided to try her in the Gasparilla Stakes last month.

Once again, they knew far better than the betting public.  Though Missalaney got away at 42/1, she rallied to cross the wire third, and was the only one closing ground on winner R Girls a Charmer between the stretch call and the wire.  "She was coming on late," Hinsley remarked, and assessed that the return to two turns in the Suncoast would suit his filly well.

"We've just got to get lucky," quipped Hinsley.  Given the talent Missalaney has shown so far, if she runs well in the Suncoast Stakes tomorrow, it will be more than just good fortune that gets her to the wire.

In addition to the Grade III Sam F.

For those looking for local rooting interests during the Chicago racing hiatus, you will find them here.  LOVELY LOYREE, 2014's champion Illinois-bred three-year-old filly and winner of the 2015 Stickney Handicap at Hawthorne, gets a class test in the Endeavour.  She finished second in the local prep allowance last month, and tries graded company for the first time in her career.  MISSALANEY, an Illinois-bred sophomore, tries two turns on dirt for the first time in the Suncoast.   Perhaps she will be a longshot again, but this plucky filly keeps outrunning her odds.  She keyed a superfecta carryover at Hawthorne last fall when she graduated at 28/1 odds, and also finished third in the seven-furlong Gasparilla Stakes last out, at 42/1. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/picks-ponderings-chicago-horse-racing/2016/02/illinois-breds-lovely-loyree-missalaney/">You can learn more about LOVELY LOYREE and MISSALANEY, too.</a>

<strong>Race 5: Sam F. Davis Staies (GIII), three-year-olds, one and one sixteenth miles on the dirt, post time 2:15pm EST</strong>

Sam F. Davis was a businessman in the Tampa area who served as president of Tampa Bay Downs from 1972 through 1980.  The next year, the track inaugurated this stakes for three-year-olds in his honour.  It has been run on dirt at a mile and a sixteenth every year but 1981 (one mile seventy yards) and 1985 (seven furlongs), and gained its Grade III status in 2009.  A prep for the Tampa Bay Derby, five horses have followed a win in this race up with a win in Tampa Bay Downs's richest event of the year: Phantom Jet (1987), Speedy Cure (1991), Marco Bay (1993), Thundering Storm (1996), and Burning Roma (2001).  Though no one has yet won the Sam F. Davis and then one of the Triple Crown races, Bluegrass Cat (2006) came closest.  He finished second behind Barbaro on the first Saturday in May, and also finished second behind Jazil in the Belmont.  Bluegrass Cat was the first of five winners that trainer Todd Pletcher has sent forth in this race; Pletcher sends out two of the seven runners in this year's edition, as well.

<em>Bluegrass Cat outfinishes longshot Deputy Glitters to win the 2006 Sam F. Davis Stakes.</em>

Once again, this race does not offer Road to the Kentucky Derby points.  However, it has a $250,000 purse, and seven three-year-olds will contest for it.  This race looks loaded with speed.  Pasco Stakes winner MORNING FIRE ranks as the speed of it, but GETTYSBURG and AWESOME SLATE have also shown their best on the front as well.  Either they press MORNING FIRE and it falls apart, or MORNING FIRE guns it but cannot quite get there.  Either way, RAFTING looks well set for success.  Though he has been on the shelf since a decisive win in the Smooth Air Stakes last November at Gulfstream Park West, trainer Graham Motion does well off of similar layoffs.  Furthermore, RAFTING has been turning in solid five- and six-furlong drills since early January.  He gets rider Edgar Prado back, he is bred to stretch out past the flat mile of the Smooth Air (by Tapit out of a Kris S. mare), and he should get the stalk-and-pounce trip that has served him so well in his two wins to date.

WHATAWONDERFLWORLD tries dirt for the first time in his career.  He graduated second out on turf, and followed that up with a turf mile allowance.  Both of those wins came against New York-breds.  He made his three-year-old debut in the OBS Championship Stakes, rallying to win at a mile and a sixteenth on the synthetic surface.  Dirt should be within his abilities -- he is a Tiz Wonderful half to dirt stakes winner Warriorscmoutoplay, and two other dirt winners.  A stalking to midpack type, he is another who should be well set in the pace scenario, especially if he replicates the late kick he showed in Ocala.

GETTYSBURG is the morning line favourite here, and the Pletcher horse likely to take more money.  However, he still has to prove he is not one-way speed, since MORNING FIRE will almost certainly outgun him out of the gate.  The Pletcher who appeals more here is DESTIN.  He comes in out of a fourth-place finish in the LeComte Stakes.  Oddly enough, he was farther off the pace than he liked to be before, despite the fact that he was first-time blinkers.  The rider change to Pletcher's main man John Velazquez is a positive here.  DESTIN has a pair of sharp works since that last start.  He should be ready to put in a sharper effort here; expect him to stalk off the likes of MORNING FIRE, AWESOME SLATE, and GETTYSBURG, and gain into the frame late.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#5 RAFTING (7/2)</strong>

<strong>#WHATAWONDERFLWORLD (7/2)</strong>

<strong>#3 DESTIN (3/1)</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  <strong>#7 AWESOME SLATE (15/1)</strong> was a well-beaten third behind MORNING FIRE in the Pasco Stakes last out.  That was a class test for him, as all of his previous races had been at Northlands Park.  However, there is just enough to give AWESOME SLATE one more chance, particularly at a long price.  That last race was his first since October, so he comes in second off a three-month lay here for 18% second-off trainer Brian Lynch.  He has not tried this distance yet, but romped at a flat mile at Northlands, and has solid distance breeding (Summer Bird out of an Awesome Again mare).  He gets a rider change to Julien Leparoux, as well; Leparoux has booted home four of his last seven for Lynch.  Will improvement second off be enough to win?  Perhaps not, but AWESOME SLATE could invade the exotics for a very long price.

<strong>Race 8: Lambholm South Endeavour Stakes (GIII), four-year-olds and up, fillies and mares, one and on sixteenth miles on the turf, post time 3:45 EST</strong>

This year marks the 17th running of the Endeavour Stakes.  The race was originally run at about 1 1/8 miles, but shortened to its current distance of 1 1/16 miles in 2004.  It has been a Grade III race since 2008.  Its best-known winner to date won the race before it earned a grade: Delta Princess, who won the race in 2005.  Not only was Delta Princess a three-time graded stakes winner on the track, but she also excelled in the breeding shed.  Delta Princess produced three-time Eclipse winner Royal Delta as well as 2014 Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup winner Crown Queen.  Two Eclipse Award winners have won the Endeavour: 2006 Champion Two Year Old Filly Dreaming of Anna (2008) opened her four-year-old season with a win in this race, and 2012 Champion Grass Mare Zagora (2012) began her championship season with an Endeavour win.  On a more local bent, Lots o' Lex came within a length of stealing the 2015 Endeavour Stakes at 76/1 odds.  She won a pair of allowances in the Chicago circuit later in the year, and finished second behind LOVELY LOYREE in the Stickney Handicap last October.

This year's edition of the Endeavour Stakes offers a $150,000 purse, with seven fillies and mares set to answer the call to the post.  The 7/5 morning line on TEPIN does not appear to be one of the great moments in morning line making -- this space anticipates something more like 2/5, possibly even 1/5, with a side of bridgejumping.  That said, TEPIN looks like the goods here.  Sure, she has not raced since the Breeders' Cup, but trainer Mark Casse wins at 17% off lays of three months or more, and TEPIN herself fired fresh off the lay last year.  Furthermore, she will be forwardly placed, and LOVELY LOYREE is the only one in the field who has shown anywhere near the sort of affinity for the lead that TEPIN has.  All of this makes TEPIN a strong single here.

Beyond TEPIN, this looks quite an evenly matched race.  With the pace setup the way it looks, a long price on consistent Illinois-bred LOVELY LOYREE is attractive here.  She is as consistent as it gets -- LOVELY LOYREE has not missed the money in her last ten starts.  That includes seven money finishes at this distance, with three wins.  It also includes some speed figures right in range with what she needs to contend for a share here.  She is speedy enough to get a clear lead if TEPIN chooses to sit off, and ratable enough to stalk should TEPIN gun it.  She showed an affinity for the course last out when finishing second in the prep allowance -- and though BUREAU DE CHANGE ran her down, she well outperformed the horse she duelled with.  That mare, Speed Seeker, finished a tired sixth.  It was a sharp run for LOVELY LOYREE, period, but even better in light of the fact that it was her first race in almost three months.  Finally, her connections are red-hot.  Trainer Michele Boyce has won at a 26% clip this Tampa meet, including three wins last weekend.  Rider Fernando De La Cruz has taken eight mounts for her over the last two months -- and has four wins, seven money finishes, and a robust +$5.85 ROI to show for it.  You're getting a lot for the longest shot on the morning line.

There is almost as much to like with LADY LARA, albeit for a bit shorter price.  Though LADY LARA has often come from well off the pace, she showed a nice stalking dimension last out when she won the My Charmer Handicap (GIII).  As a frenetic pace seems unlikely here, that should help LADY LARA's case.  It is like splitting hairs -- LADY LARA is probably a bit faster than LEXIE LOU, who also has a stalking dimension, and can likely sit in a bit better place than PHOTO CALL or BUREAU DE CHANGE.  LADY LARA does come in first off a layoff, but that has not posed a problem before -- last year, first off an even longer lay, she kicked on well to win the Grade II Honey Fox at Gulfstream.  She has also never missed the board in three tries at this distance.

Is this to say that others can't get a share?  No.  LEXIE LOU should improve off her third in the prep allowance, and PHOTO CALL is hard to count out on connections alone.  Really, past TEPIN, an argument can be made that anyone here could score a slot on the podium.  LOVELY LOYREE is the price and pace play, and LADY LARA can stalk and fires well off lays.  They're slight distinctions, but they are distinctions nonetheless.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Selections:</span></span>

<strong>#1 LOVELY LOYREE (12/1)</strong>

<strong>#3 LADY LARA (4/1)</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  You do see two horses above who are not named TEPIN, yes?

<strong>Race 9: Suncoast Stakes, three year old fillies, one mile and forty yards on the dirt, post time 4:15pm EST</strong>

This year marks the 36th year that the Suncoast Stakes has been run, though it was named the Gardenia Stakes through 1988.  Originally a seven-furlong race for three-year-old fillies, it was stretched to 1 1/16 miles starting in 1993.  In 2007 it was run at about a mile, and the next year it settled at its current distance of a mile and forty yards.  If Illinois-bred MISSALANEY wins the Suncoast this year, she would become the second Illinois-bred to do so.  Toll Taker (2005) was bred in the state by Lothenbach Stables, though campaigned by trainer Timothy Hills for Sea Gull Associates after being transferred privately.  Other Suncoast winners have had success in the Suncoast Stakes, as well.  The durable racemare Leave It Be (1988), who won 24 times in her 61 starts, won the Sixty Sails Handicap (GIII) at Sportsman's Park in 1990 as well as the Lady Hallie Handicap over that same track in 1991.  Crown Jewel (1999) went off the favourite in the National Jockey Club Oaks at Hawthorne that April, but settled for second behind Isle Be Loving You on that trip to Stickney.

This year's Suncoast Stakes drew a field of 12 to contest for a $100,000 purse.  The field looks well matched, the sort of race in which it is difficult to take chalk.  The pace is also a bit of a question -- it hinges on how well HEY GIRL HEY, LOOKING AT BEAUTY, and WILD RIDGE are able to keep VALUEABLE CHARMER honest early.  If VALUEABLE CHARMER does get a lot of pressure early, it should set up very well for WEEP NO MORE to mow them down.  She comes into this race second off a break.  In that first race back, on January 22, she graduated over this same course and distance, with rider Victor Lebron in the irons.  Lebron returns here.  Trainer George Arnold has been choosy with his spots this Tampa meet, with two wins and a second in just five starts.  He also boasts a 20% win rate with last out maiden winners.  This looks like a sharp spotting for WEEP NO MORE: she has strong late pace, she has form over the love-it-or-hate-it Tampa course, and one reasonable step forward from her maiden win gets this race won at a solid price.

On the other hand, VALUEABLE CHARMER could just be too fast for the rest early.  On top of that, she has shown an ability to survive pressure early and then get home.  It seems unlikely that she will do anything but send, as she is on the stretch out, and has done he best work from on or near the lead.  The fact that she has survived pressure on the front end before gives her a shot to stay on to be a factor late.  Furthermore, VALUEABLE CHARMER has never lost a race over fast dirt, including a pair of wins over the Tampa dirt for 29% conditioner Gerald Bennett.  Though she faltered in the Gasparilla Stkaes last out, her first try against added-money company, R Girls a Charmer outgunned her out of the gate that day, and she was taken out of her element.  Though VALUEABLE CHARMER is probably one-way speed, she looks comparably fast enough that it could bail her out.

Trainer Eoin Harty originally had a pair of entrants, but DREAMUP scratched the day of the race.  That leaves ups with morning line favourite COSMIC GIRL, second last out in the Gasparilla.  She will likely be a short price, but after her second-place run behind buzzsaw R Girls a Charmer, she does loom large here.  In addition to that stakes second, she also has a win over the Tampa dirt, an authoritative allowance score going seven furlongs back in December.  She has every right to appreciate the stretch to two turns.  Though COSMIC GIRL faltered in her one previous two-turn try at Keeneland, she was on the lead that day.  Assuming COSMIC GIRL gets her better midpack spot today, her breeding makes her well worth another shot at two turns.

<strong>Race 10: Tampa Bay Stakes (GIII), four year olds and up, one and one sixteenth miles on the turf, post time 4:45pm EST
</strong>

The Tampa Bay Stakes began life in 1996 as the Tampa Bay Breeders' Cup Stakes, changing to its current name in 2008.  It has always been run on the turf, and always been run at a mile and a sixteenth -- except for 2008, when it was run at about a mile and a sixteenth on the grass.  The race gained its Grade III status in 2011, and has held it ever since.  One Illinois-bred has won the Tampa Bay Stakes: iron horse Fort Prado, who posted an authoritative victory in the 2006 edition of the race.  Cosmonaut (2008), though not bred in the state, made good account of himself in Illinois.  He won the Arlington Handicap (GIII) in both 2006 and 2007, and hit the board in that race in both 2008 and 2009.  Karelian (2010) was also a stakes winner at Arlington, capturing the Sea O Erin Handicap in 2008.

Shug McGaughey does not always run horses at Tampa, but when he does, they win.  He has been a sniper of sorts, with two wins in two starts this meet.  It is a small sample, of course, but do not be surprised if he makes it three-for-three with RELOAD here.  RELOAD races for the first time since November, but McGaughey wins at 21% off of similarly long lays, and RELOAD himself has fired some of his sharpest races fresh off a lay.  With regular works dating back to late December, he should be fit enough to do so once again.  He also reverts to rider Javier Castellano, who rode him for a string of six consecutive starts between 2013 and 2015.  In terms of pace, RELOAD has a strong versatility.  He can take the lead, or he can rally from as far back as midpack.  Expect a rally, as longshot SPARK KIT is most likely to go, with SOLEMN TRIBUTE, SPECIAL ENVOY and SKY CAPTAIN most likely to try to stick to his heels -- but all of these have also run creditable races while rated, giving RELOAD that flexibility to send if he must.

OLD TIME HOCKEY has shown strong form over the grass at Tampa Bay Downs, with two wins and a second to show for three starts over the course.  The second-place finish came in this race last year, when he went off as a 24/1 outsider.  That came first off a lay; this year, OLD TIME HOCKEY has gotten a race under him already.  Though he was fifth against a bit weaker company last out in the Sunshine Millions Turf, a reasonable step forward from this would be nothing he hasn't shown before.  He also comes from connections you can trust at Tampa Bay Downs.  Trainer Tom Proctor has a 17% win rate this meet.  Ronald Allen, Jr., OLD TIME HOCKEY's regular rider, is also a regular rider at Tampa -- and has a 20% strike rate this meet.  In short, watch for OLD TIME HOCKEY to come rallying late for a good price.  WAR CORRESPONDENT also deserves a look.  He is a stalking type -- best when tracking a length or two off the lead, but with excellent late pace when he fires.  This style should suit the race well.  Though WAR CORRESPONDENT was seventh last out in the Fort Lauderdale (GII), he was only beaten three lengths for all of it, and that was his first race since May.  He finished two and a half lengths behind Lukes Alley -- a next-out Grade I winner in the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap.  All Included, third in the Fort Lauderdale, returned to finish third in the Gulfstream Park Turf, just a length behind Lukes Alley.  The humans also bolster his case.  Trainer Christophe Clement is 20% with runners second off the lay, and has hit the board with three of four runners at Tampa this meet.  Rider John Velazquez returns to the irons; the only other time he rode War Correspondent, they won the Appleton Stakes (GIII) last year.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#7 RELOAD (6/1)</strong>

<strong><strong>#2 OLD TIME HOCKEY (8/1)</strong></strong>

<strong>#1 WAR CORRESPONDENT (7/2)</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  <strong>#11 KARIBU GARDENS (6/1)</strong> comes into this race second off the lay.  First back, the Josie Carroll trainee steamrolled an allowance field at Gulfstream Park.  With early zip likely from several of the runners here, KARIBU GARDENS regularly musters very strong late pace.  He also gets Joe Bravo back in the irons; Bravo does not ride regularly at Tampa, but he is a jockey who can travel just about anywhere and be live.  KARIBU GARDENS also has a strong record at the distance of this race -- in four tries at a mile and a sixteenth on grass, he has two wins (including that last-out victory) and a third.  With so many other solid horses in the field, perhaps he gets lost in the shuffle and drifts higher than his morning line.  If that happens, he has a shot at a nice price.

WHATAWONDERFLWORLD tries dirt for the first time in his career.  He graduated second out on turf, and followed that up with a turf mile allowance.  Both of those wins came against New York-breds.  He made his three-year-old debut in the OBS Championship Stakes, rallying to win at a mile and a sixteenth on the synthetic surface.  Dirt should be within his abilities -- he is a Tiz Wonderful half to dirt stakes winner Warriorscmoutoplay, and two other dirt winners.  A stalking to midpack type, he is another who should be well set in the pace scenario, especially if he replicates the late kick he showed in Ocala.

GETTYSBURG is the morning line favourite here, and the Pletcher horse likely to take more money.  However, he still has to prove he is not one-way speed, since MORNING FIRE will almost certainly outgun him out of the gate.  The Pletcher who appeals more here is DESTIN.  He comes in out of a fourth-place finish in the LeComte Stakes.  Oddly enough, he was farther off the pace than he liked to be before, despite the fact that he was first-time blinkers.  The rider change to Pletcher's main man John Velazquez is a positive here.  DESTIN has a pair of sharp works since that last start.  He should be ready to put in a sharper effort here; expect him to stalk off the likes of MORNING FIRE, AWESOME SLATE, and GETTYSBURG, and gain into the frame late.

<strong>#WHATAWONDERFLWORLD (7/2)</strong>

<strong>#3 DESTIN (3/1)</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  <strong>#7 AWESOME SLATE (15/1)</strong> was a well-beaten third behind MORNING FIRE in the Pasco Stakes last out.  That was a class test for him, as all of his previous races had been at Northlands Park.  However, there is just enough to give AWESOME SLATE one more chance, particularly at a long price.  That last race was his first since October, so he comes in second off a three-month lay here for 18% second-off trainer Brian Lynch.  He has not tried this distance yet, but romped at a flat mile at Northlands, and has solid distance breeding (Summer Bird out of an Awesome Again mare).  He gets a rider change to Julien Leparoux, as well; Leparoux has booted home four of his last seven for Lynch.  Will improvement second off be enough to win?  Perhaps not, but AWESOME SLATE could invade the exotics for a very long price.

<strong>Race 8: Lambholm South Endeavour Stakes (GIII), four-year-olds and up, fillies and mares, one and on sixteenth miles on the turf, post time 3:45 EST</strong>

This year marks the 17th running of the Endeavour Stakes.  The race was originally run at about 1 1/8 miles, but shortened to its current distance of 1 1/16 miles in 2004.  It has been a Grade III race since 2008.  Its best-known winner to date won the race before it earned a grade: Delta Princess, who won the race in 2005.  Not only was Delta Princess a three-time graded stakes winner on the track, but she also excelled in the breeding shed.  Delta Princess produced three-time Eclipse winner Royal Delta as well as 2014 Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup winner Crown Queen.  Two Eclipse Award winners have won the Endeavour: 2006 Champion Two Year Old Filly Dreaming of Anna (2008) opened her four-year-old season with a win in this race, and 2012 Champion Grass Mare Zagora (2012) began her championship season with an Endeavour win.  On a more local bent, Lots o' Lex came within a length of stealing the 2015 Endeavour Stakes at 76/1 odds.  She won a pair of allowances in the Chicago circuit later in the year, and finished second behind LOVELY LOYREE in the Stickney Handicap last October.

This year's edition of the Endeavour Stakes offers a $150,000 purse, with seven fillies and mares set to answer the call to the post.  The 7/5 morning line on TEPIN does not appear to be one of the great moments in morning line making -- this space anticipates something more like 2/5, possibly even 1/5, with a side of bridgejumping.  That said, TEPIN looks like the goods here.  Sure, she has not raced since the Breeders' Cup, but trainer Mark Casse wins at 17% off lays of three months or more, and TEPIN herself fired fresh off the lay last year.  Furthermore, she will be forwardly placed, and LOVELY LOYREE is the only one in the field who has shown anywhere near the sort of affinity for the lead that TEPIN has.  All of this makes TEPIN a strong single here.

Beyond TEPIN, this looks quite an evenly matched race.  With the pace setup the way it looks, a long price on consistent Illinois-bred LOVELY LOYREE is attractive here.  She is as consistent as it gets -- LOVELY LOYREE has not missed the money in her last ten starts.  That includes seven money finishes at this distance, with three wins.  It also includes some speed figures right in range with what she needs to contend for a share here.  She is speedy enough to get a clear lead if TEPIN chooses to sit off, and ratable enough to stalk should TEPIN gun it.  She showed an affinity for the course last out when finishing second in the prep allowance -- and though BUREAU DE CHANGE ran her down, she well outperformed the horse she duelled with.  That mare, Speed Seeker, finished a tired sixth.  It was a sharp run for LOVELY LOYREE, period, but even better in light of the fact that it was her first race in almost three months.  Finally, her connections are red-hot.  Trainer Michele Boyce has won at a 26% clip this Tampa meet, including three wins last weekend.  Rider Fernando De La Cruz has taken eight mounts for her over the last two months -- and has four wins, seven money finishes, and a robust +$5.85 ROI to show for it.  You're getting a lot for the longest shot on the morning line.

There is almost as much to like with LADY LARA, albeit for a bit shorter price.  Though LADY LARA has often come from well off the pace, she showed a nice stalking dimension last out when she won the My Charmer Handicap (GIII).  As a frenetic pace seems unlikely here, that should help LADY LARA's case.  It is like splitting hairs -- LADY LARA is probably a bit faster than LEXIE LOU, who also has a stalking dimension, and can likely sit in a bit better place than PHOTO CALL or BUREAU DE CHANGE.  LADY LARA does come in first off a layoff, but that has not posed a problem before -- last year, first off an even longer lay, she kicked on well to win the Grade II Honey Fox at Gulfstream.  She has also never missed the board in three tries at this distance.

Is this to say that others can't get a share?  No.  LEXIE LOU should improve off her third in the prep allowance, and PHOTO CALL is hard to count out on connections alone.  Really, past TEPIN, an argument can be made that anyone here could score a slot on the podium.  LOVELY LOYREE is the price and pace play, and LADY LARA can stalk and fires well off lays.  They're slight distinctions, but they are distinctions nonetheless.

<strong>Race 9: Suncoast Stakes, three year old fillies, one mile and forty yards on the dirt, post time 4:15pm EST</strong>

This year marks the 36th year that the Suncoast Stakes has been run, though it was named the Gardenia Stakes through 1988.  Originally a seven-furlong race for three-year-old fillies, it was stretched to 1 1/16 miles starting in 1993.  In 2007 it was run at about a mile, and the next year it settled at its current distance of a mile and forty yards.  If Illinois-bred MISSALANEY wins the Suncoast this year, she would become the second Illinois-bred to do so.  Toll Taker (2005) was bred in the state by Lothenbach Stables, though campaigned by trainer Timothy Hills for Sea Gull Associates after being transferred privately.  Other Suncoast winners have had success in the Suncoast Stakes, as well.  The durable racemare Leave It Be (1988), who won 24 times in her 61 starts, won the Sixty Sails Handicap (GIII) at Sportsman's Park in 1990 as well as the Lady Hallie Handicap over that same track in 1991.  Crown Jewel (1999) went off the favourite in the National Jockey Club Oaks at Hawthorne that April, but settled for second behind Isle Be Loving You on that trip to Stickney.

This year's Suncoast Stakes drew a field of 12 to contest for a $100,000 purse.  The field looks well matched, the sort of race in which it is difficult to take chalk.  The pace is also a bit of a question -- it hinges on how well HEY GIRL HEY, LOOKING AT BEAUTY, and WILD RIDGE are able to keep VALUEABLE CHARMER honest early.  If VALUEABLE CHARMER does get a lot of pressure early, it should set up very well for WEEP NO MORE to mow them down.  She comes into this race second off a break.  In that first race back, on January 22, she graduated over this same course and distance, with rider Victor Lebron in the irons.  Lebron returns here.  Trainer George Arnold has been choosy with his spots this Tampa meet, with two wins and a second in just five starts.  He also boasts a 20% win rate with last out maiden winners.  This looks like a sharp spotting for WEEP NO MORE: she has strong late pace, she has form over the love-it-or-hate-it Tampa course, and one reasonable step forward from her maiden win gets this race won at a solid price.

On the other hand, VALUEABLE CHARMER could just be too fast for the rest early.  On top of that, she has shown an ability to survive pressure early and then get home.  It seems unlikely that she will do anything but send, as she is on the stretch out, and has done he best work from on or near the lead.  The fact that she has survived pressure on the front end before gives her a shot to stay on to be a factor late.  Furthermore, VALUEABLE CHARMER has never lost a race over fast dirt, including a pair of wins over the Tampa dirt for 29% conditioner Gerald Bennett.  Though she faltered in the Gasparilla Stkaes last out, her first try against added-money company, R Girls a Charmer outgunned her out of the gate that day, and she was taken out of her element.  Though VALUEABLE CHARMER is probably one-way speed, she looks comparably fast enough that it could bail her out.

Trainer Eoin Harty originally had a pair of entrants, but DREAMUP scratched the day of the race.  That leaves ups with morning line favourite COSMIC GIRL, second last out in the Gasparilla.  She will likely be a short price, but after her second-place run behind buzzsaw R Girls a Charmer, she does loom large here.  In addition to that stakes second, she also has a win over the Tampa dirt, an authoritative allowance score going seven furlongs back in December.  She has every right to appreciate the stretch to two turns.  Though COSMIC GIRL faltered in her one previous two-turn try at Keeneland, she was on the lead that day.  Assuming COSMIC GIRL gets her better midpack spot today, her breeding makes her well worth another shot at two turns.

<strong>Race 10: Tampa Bay Stakes (GIII), four year olds and up, one and one sixteenth miles on the turf, post time 4:45pm EST
</strong>

The Tampa Bay Stakes began life in 1996 as the Tampa Bay Breeders' Cup Stakes, changing to its current name in 2008.  It has always been run on the turf, and always been run at a mile and a sixteenth -- except for 2008, when it was run at about a mile and a sixteenth on the grass.  The race gained its Grade III status in 2011, and has held it ever since.  One Illinois-bred has won the Tampa Bay Stakes: iron horse Fort Prado, who posted an authoritative victory in the 2006 edition of the race.  Cosmonaut (2008), though not bred in the state, made good account of himself in Illinois.  He won the Arlington Handicap (GIII) in both 2006 and 2007, and hit the board in that race in both 2008 and 2009.  Karelian (2010) was also a stakes winner at Arlington, capturing the Sea O Erin Handicap in 2008.

Shug McGaughey does not always run horses at Tampa, but when he does, they win.  He has been a sniper of sorts, with two wins in two starts this meet.  It is a small sample, of course, but do not be surprised if he makes it three-for-three with RELOAD here.  RELOAD races for the first time since November, but McGaughey wins at 21% off of similarly long lays, and RELOAD himself has fired some of his sharpest races fresh off a lay.  With regular works dating back to late December, he should be fit enough to do so once again.  He also reverts to rider Javier Castellano, who rode him for a string of six consecutive starts between 2013 and 2015.  In terms of pace, RELOAD has a strong versatility.  He can take the lead, or he can rally from as far back as midpack.  Expect a rally, as longshot SPARK KIT is most likely to go, with SOLEMN TRIBUTE, SPECIAL ENVOY and SKY CAPTAIN most likely to try to stick to his heels -- but all of these have also run creditable races while rated, giving RELOAD that flexibility to send if he must.

OLD TIME HOCKEY has shown strong form over the grass at Tampa Bay Downs, with two wins and a second to show for three starts over the course.  The second-place finish came in this race last year, when he went off as a 24/1 outsider.  That came first off a lay; this year, OLD TIME HOCKEY has gotten a race under him already.  Though he was fifth against a bit weaker company last out in the Sunshine Millions Turf, a reasonable step forward from this would be nothing he hasn't shown before.  He also comes from connections you can trust at Tampa Bay Downs.  Trainer Tom Proctor has a 17% win rate this meet.  Ronald Allen, Jr., OLD TIME HOCKEY's regular rider, is also a regular rider at Tampa -- and has a 20% strike rate this meet.  In short, watch for OLD TIME HOCKEY to come rallying late for a good price.  WAR CORRESPONDENT also deserves a look.  He is a stalking type -- best when tracking a length or two off the lead, but with excellent late pace when he fires.  This style should suit the race well.  Though WAR CORRESPONDENT was seventh last out in the Fort Lauderdale (GII), he was only beaten three lengths for all of it, and that was his first race since May.  He finished two and a half lengths behind Lukes Alley -- a next-out Grade I winner in the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap.  All Included, third in the Fort Lauderdale, returned to finish third in the Gulfstream Park Turf, just a length behind Lukes Alley.  The humans also bolster his case.  Trainer Christophe Clement is 20% with runners second off the lay, and has hit the board with three of four runners at Tampa this meet.  Rider John Velazquez returns to the irons; the only other time he rode War Correspondent, they won the Appleton Stakes (GIII) last year.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#7 RELOAD (6/1)</strong>

<strong><strong>#2 OLD TIME HOCKEY (8/1)</strong></strong>

<strong>#1 WAR CORRESPONDENT (7/2)</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  <strong>#11 KARIBU GARDENS (6/1)</strong> comes into this race second off the lay.  First back, the Josie Carroll trainee steamrolled an allowance field at Gulfstream Park.  With early zip likely from several of the runners here, KARIBU GARDENS regularly musters very strong late pace.  He also gets Joe Bravo back in the irons; Bravo does not ride regularly at Tampa, but he is a jockey who can travel just about anywhere and be live.  KARIBU GARDENS also has a strong record at the distance of this race -- in four tries at a mile and a sixteenth on grass, he has two wins (including that last-out victory) and a third.  With so many other solid horses in the field, perhaps he gets lost in the shuffle and drifts higher than his morning line.  If that happens, he has a shot at a nice price.

Oh sure, Valentine's Day is soon and that holiday's obvious connotations.  But it's also a weekend with three Kentucky Derby prep races and a chance to fall in love with a horse you can root for the in the Derby.  Whether you plunked down cash in the futures, will make a pilgrimage to Las Vegas, or just want a clever rooting interest, this is the season to start scouring the land and the sophomore preps.

The three preps this weekend are the G3 El Camino Real Derby from Golden Gate Fields, the G3 Sam F. Davis from Tampa bay Downs,  and <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/picks-ponderings-chicago-horse-racing/2016/02/2016-southwest-stakes-preview/"> the G3 Southwest Stakes from Oaklawn</a> scheduled for Presidents' Day. Paul Mazur will tackle the Southwest Stakes in its own piece.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/picks-ponderings-chicago-horse-racing/2016/02/2016-sam-f-davis-stakes-day-preview/">Nicolle Neulist picks and ponders the G3 Davis from Tampa Bay, as well as all three other stakes on the card</a>.

With two hundred thousand dollars and a 10-4-2-1 point parsing on the line, the Grade Three El Camino Real Derby is a full-fledged Kentucky Derby prep.  As we're at Golden Gate Fields in Northern California, the El Camino Real Derby goes on their all-weather Tapeta surface.  The top-shelf prep of Northern California is one of the premier races of the NorCal region.  The El Camino Real Derby began its life in 1982 on the dirt at turned-to-housing Bay Meadows and was shifted to the all-weather in 2009, where it's been ever since.  That same year the race permanently moved to Golden Gate, as both NorCal tracks of Golden Gate and Bay Meadows traded the race in the 2000s. Contested at a mile and a sixteenth from inception until 2008, it stretched out to its current distance in 2009.

Although the El Camino Real Derby has never yielded a Kentucky Derby winner, it has produced three winners of the Preakness in Tank's Prospect (1985), Snow Chief (1986), and Tabasco Cat (1994). Also among notable winners is Cavonnier (1996), a stakes namesake on the summertime Northern California fair circuit and Cause To Believe (2006), who in his final Derby prep was third in the Illinois Derby. Though not a winner, 2003 Illinois Derby winner and Travers winner Ten Most Wanted was third in that year's El Camino Real Derby.

<strong><em>Golden Gate Fields -- Race 7 -- G3 El Camino Real Derby -- One and one-eighth miles on Tapeta -- post time 3:45 PT</em></strong>

SAN DIMAS serves as the setting for <em>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</em><em></em>.  SAN DIMAS also serves as the pick in the G3 El Camino Real Derby.  Sure, there are common elements beyond the name: handicapping does require the element of time travel that served as the crux of the Keanu Reeves film, and SAN DIMAS is functional to this piece.  But Rufus didn't step out of the phone booth to impart this selection to <em>Picks &amp; Ponderings</em>.  The Eoin Harty trainee may have only one win in the career, but this renewal of NorCal's Derby prep isn't that far away from a first-level allowance.  Ricardo Gonzalez will have the mount on this runner that graduated last time and in both his two turn starts over the local synthetic, has come from off the pace - the last time to get the diploma.  In a field with forward types, passing impaired types (looking at you, 2/1 morning line favorite FRANK CONVERSATION), and stretchouts comes a runner that can pass and will get pace targets - the full field almost necessitates as well as young horses doing strange new things.   SAN DIMAS is by Hard Spun out of a Pleasantly Perfect, meaning there is excellent (okay, play your air guitar) two-turn form and nine furlongs should be within reach.  SAN DIMAS likely won't be the favorite on the tote - that will go to Southern California shipper FRANK CONVERSATION (the horse pegged originally for this spot, MR. COKER, scratched on the day of the race).  While SAN DIMAS is a runner that benefits from a pace meltdown, another that does is MARQULA.  Four of six in the money lifetime, he's cashed place and show checks in the local feeders to this El Camino Real.  They've also had short fields too, meaning that a runner like him that might be pace dependent hasn't gotten enough front end gas to light his closing engine.  A full field of fourteen might make him need a trip.  But as the local horse-for-the-course who gets the pace targets he's yearned for, he could do better than expected.  He's been the two turn trip at Golden Gate before - something many others in this field have not. One thing that's been bogus this year is the record of trainer H. Graham Motion. TUSK (sorry, no Fleetwood Mac references here) is the "B" motion runner in this full field.  Brought to you by Flaxman Holdings - who when with Motion campaigned Main Sequence - he won his maiden three back on the lawn at Del Mar n the fall before being hoisted up in class in the G3 DeMille during the Hollywood Turf Festival.  The graded race over Turkey Day weekend was a bridge too far, and he returned to be an even third in a first level allowance at Santa Anita on the lawn.  He tries synthetic for the first time, and maybe that can jumpstart his form.  Being competitive in an N1X actually makes him plausible in this field.  Plus he'll have the riding sevices of Juan Hernandez, who's settled nicely into the "best rider not named Russell Baze" role at Golden Gate.

Contested at a mile and a sixteenth from inception until 2008, it stretched out to its current distance in 2009.

Although the El Camino Real Derby has never yielded a Kentucky Derby winner, it has produced three winners of the Preakness in Tank's Prospect (1985), Snow Chief (1986), and Tabasco Cat (1994). Also among notable winners is Cavonnier (1996), a stakes namesake on the summertime Northern California fair circuit and Cause To Believe (2006), who in his final Derby prep was third in the Illinois Derby. Though not a winner, 2003 Illinois Derby winner and Travers winner Ten Most Wanted was third in that year's El Camino Real Derby.

<strong><em>Golden Gate Fields -- Race 7 -- G3 El Camino Real Derby -- One and one-eighth miles on Tapeta -- post time 3:45 PT</em></strong>

SAN DIMAS serves as the setting for <em>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</em><em></em>.  SAN DIMAS also serves as the pick in the G3 El Camino Real Derby.  Sure, there are common elements beyond the name: handicapping does require the element of time travel that served as the crux of the Keanu Reeves film, and SAN DIMAS is functional to this piece.  But Rufus didn't step out of the phone booth to impart this selection to <em>Picks &amp; Ponderings</em>.  The Eoin Harty trainee may have only one win in the career, but this renewal of NorCal's Derby prep isn't that far away from a first-level allowance.  Ricardo Gonzalez will have the mount on this runner that graduated last time and in both his two turn starts over the local synthetic, has come from off the pace - the last time to get the diploma.  In a field with forward types, passing impaired types (looking at you, 2/1 morning line favorite FRANK CONVERSATION), and stretchouts comes a runner that can pass and will get pace targets - the full field almost necessitates as well as young horses doing strange new things.   SAN DIMAS is by Hard Spun out of a Pleasantly Perfect, meaning there is excellent (okay, play your air guitar) two-turn form and nine furlongs should be within reach.  SAN DIMAS likely won't be the favorite on the tote - that will go to Southern California shipper FRANK CONVERSATION (the horse pegged originally for this spot, MR. COKER, scratched on the day of the race).  While SAN DIMAS is a runner that benefits from a pace meltdown, another that does is MARQULA.  Four of six in the money lifetime, he's cashed place and show checks in the local feeders to this El Camino Real.  They've also had short fields too, meaning that a runner like him that might be pace dependent hasn't gotten enough front end gas to light his closing engine.  A full field of fourteen might make him need a trip.  But as the local horse-for-the-course who gets the pace targets he's yearned for, he could do better than expected.  He's been the two turn trip at Golden Gate before - something many others in this field have not. One thing that's been bogus this year is the record of trainer H. Graham Motion. TUSK (sorry, no Fleetwood Mac references here) is the "B" motion runner in this full field.  Brought to you by Flaxman Holdings - who when with Motion campaigned Main Sequence - he won his maiden three back on the lawn at Del Mar n the fall before being hoisted up in class in the G3 DeMille during the Hollywood Turf Festival.  The graded race over Turkey Day weekend was a bridge too far, and he returned to be an even third in a first level allowance at Santa Anita on the lawn.  He tries synthetic for the first time, and maybe that can jumpstart his form.  Being competitive in an N1X actually makes him plausible in this field.  Plus he'll have the riding sevices of Juan Hernandez, who's settled nicely into the "best rider not named Russell Baze" role at Golden Gate.

<strong>#6 SAN DIMAS (20/1)

<strong>Race 4: Robert B. Lewis Stakes (GIII), three-year-olds, one and one sixteenth miles on the dirt, post time 2:00pm PST</strong>

This year marks the 78th running of the Robert B. Lewis Stakes.  Previously the Santa Catalina Stakes, it was renamed in 2007 for Robert B. Lewis (1924-2006).  A beer salesman and distributor by trade, Lewis and his wife Beverly (herself a stakes namesake at Los Alamitos) became Thoroughbred owners in 1990.  Two of their horses won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes: Silver Charm in 1997, and Charismatic in 1999.  Both Silver Charm and Charismatic won the Eclipse Award for Champion Three Year Old Male.  They also owned four other Eclipse-winning horses: Timber Country (1994 Champion Two Year Old Male), Serena's Song (1995 Champion Three Year Old Female), Orientate (2002 Champion Sprinter), and Folklore (2005 Champion Two Year Old Female).

The race has been restricted to three-year-olds since 1964.  It has produced two Kentucky Derby winners: Ferdinand (1986) and I'll Have Another (2012).  This race was also the first stakes win for both Sham (1973), famously second behind Secretariat in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, as well as 1999 Champion Sprinter Artax (1998).  Last year's Lewis was once again a productive race.  Dortmund beat Firing Line by a nose that day after a thrilling duel.  Three months later, Firing Line finished second in the Kentucky Derby, with Dortmund third.  The 2016 renewal features a $150,000 purse, as well as Road to the Kentucky Derby points (10-4-2-1) to the top four finishers.

I WILL SCORE benefits significantly after the scratch of LAOBAN.  He ranks as the speed of the speed, particularly since he stretches out to a route first-time, and should carve out the early fractions.  He has shown the ability to survive a contentious pace, and win even after being headed.  That is always good to see in a speed horse, and particularly worth noting in a relatively inexperienced three-year-old.  I WILL SCORE keeps Mike Smith in the irons, interesting since Smith had ridden DRESSED IN HERMES before, and had been named on him before he scratched from the Sham.  Trainer Jerry Hollendorfer's charges win at 22% second off the lay, and also 21% going first time route.  Being by Roman Ruler out of a dam whose only other runner (Willing to Travel) has won at two turns, I WILL SCORE should have no trouble getting the distance in the Lewis.

LET'S MEET IN RIO was a fast-closing second as the Baffert B in the Sham last out, and still has appeal here.  Once again, he will be the longer-priced Baffert, thanks to MOR SPIRIT also being in the field.  For an attractive price, you get a lot.  As a mid-pack to closing type, LET'S MEET IN RIO will get plenty of pace to chase.  I WILL SCORE ranks as the speed of the speed, but if that one gets locked up with UNCLE LINO, then he could get the fractions he needs to close into.  He has not gone a mile and a sixteenth yet, but his breeding suggests he will relish the extra sixteenth of a mile.  LET'S MEET IN RIO has been working well into the race, he retains the services of Kent Desormeaux (who has ridden him in his last two starts), and he is improving at the right time.

Beyond I WILL SCORE and LET'S MEET IN RIO, the race gets thorny.  It became more of a question of sifting out who had the fewest red flags, instead of truly and finally limiting contenders.  UNCLE LINO could get burned on the front end with I WILL SCORE there.  PATH OF DAVID may prefer turf.  DRESSED IN HERMES may prefer it, as well, in addition to having been a bit sick before the Sham, and losing Mike Smith to I WILL SCORE.

Among the rest, MOR SPIRIT may be chalk, but he is the best proven of the lot.  Some have argued that Toews On Ice's flop in the Smarty Jones is a black mark against MOR SPIRIT.  Sure, the performance did nothing to frank the Los Alamitos Futurity (GI) as a live race, but it would be more of a red flag had MOR SPIRIT ever looked like he was going to lose that race.  MOR SPIRIT always seemed to have Toews On Ice's measure that day.  The fact stands that he is the only horse in this race proven at this distance.  He won the Los Alamitos Futurity, and finished second behind Airoforce in a live renewal of the Kentucky Jockey Club (GI).  He has back form over the Santa Anita course.  Though MOR SPIRIT will be a short price, he has shown form too good to toss.  Win odds will be less than attractive, but he has to be used in multi-race tickets, at least defensively.

<strong>Race 5: Las Virgenes Stakes (GII), three-year-old fillies, one mile on the dirt, post time 2:30pm PST</strong>

The Las Virgenes has been run at a mile on the main track at Santa Anita since its inception in 1983.  It was first graded in 1985, upgraded to a Grade II in 1987, and then was a Grade I from 1988 through 2015.  Though the Las Virgenes has been downgraded back to a Grade II for its 2016 running, it keeps the same $300,000 purse it had last year, and also offers Road to the Kentucky Oaks points (10-4-2-1) to its top four finishers.

Its winners have gone on to see success over the year.  Four Las Virgenes winners have gone on to win the Kentucky Oaks: Fran's Valentine (1985), Goodbye Halo (1988), Lite Light (1991), and Blind Luck (2010).  Several other winners have beaten males in Grade I company: Serena's Song (1995) won the Haskell, Rags to Riches (2007) won the Belmont, and Beholder (2013) romped in the 2015 Pacific Classic.  You, most famous for winning the 2002 Test Stakes (GI) in a "photo finish that doesn't deserve a loser" over Carson Hollow, won the Las Virgenes as well.

<em>Beholder romps in the 2013 Las Virgenes Stakes.</em>

SONGBIRD ranks as the clear class of the field.  Her two-year-old speed far surpasses anything the rest of the field has been able to put up.  She is the speed of the speed in a field without any one-way speed.  Even if someone else decides to try and send, most likely either JADE PRINCESS or MERIROSVO, SONGBIRD has shown the ability to get the best of a contested pace, as she did in the Del Mar Debutante (GI) last year.  She has been working long and strong over the local course.  She gets regular rider Mike Smith back in the irons, and trainer Jerry Hollendorfer has a respectable enough win percentage off these long lays (17%, when off 90 days or more) to suggest that he should have SONGBIRD in good shape coming into here.

If SONGBIRD loses, whoever picks the winner will get paid.  However, sometimes the better part of valor lies in knowing when the chalk is the goods, singling, and moving on.  This looks like one of those times.  Though SONGBIRD is untested, she does not stand to get her test here.

STREET FANCY rallied to win the Starlet (GI) last out, after some early trouble.  She has proven herself to be a versatile sort so far.  She graduated first out from a forward placement, but finished a close third in the Desi Arnaz after rallying from the clouds.  STREET FANCY's maiden win came over the Santa Anita dirt, showing she can handle the surface, and her Starlet win last out came at two turns.  She has been working well leading into this race, and trainer Phil D'Amato has been striking at 22% this meet.  She does lose Mike Smith, but that can hardly be taken as a strike against her, as Smith shows up on SONGBIRD.  STREET FANCY does get Victor Espinoza -- previously JADE PRINCESS's rider, making the rider assignment perhaps a vote of confidence in that regard.  STREET FANCY may not be SONGBIRD, but she has shown enough to make her a solid favourite to fill out the exacta.

The other "logical" horse to consider for the "second to SONGBIRD" medal here is JADE PRINCESS.  She should be forwardly placed early, and does have two wins at the distance.  However, it has been feast or famine with her -- she has either won by daylight, or finished far up the track.  For what stands to be a short price in the exacta or trifecta pools, focusing on SHE'S A WARRIOR underneath instead makes a bit more sense.  SHE'S A WARRIOR remains a maiden, but she has been in the money in all three of her starts.  She also took a significant step forward last out, in her first try at two turns.  Though SHE'S A WARRIOR loses regular rider Mario Gutierrez to LAND OVER SEA, that raises no real red flags given how often Gutierrez rides for LAND OVER SEA's trainer Doug O'Neill.  SHE'S A WARRIOR gets a capable rider in Flavien Prat, and Prat has won two of his last four (with another in the money) for trainer Peter Eurton.  SHE'S A WARRIOR has been working well, she has form over the course, and she is fast enough to contend.  The value in the exotic pools lives with her.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#6 SONGBIRD (1/5)</strong>

<strong>#3 STREET FANCY (6/1)</strong>

<strong>#1 SHE'S A WARRIOR (20/1)</strong>

Its winners have gone on to see success over the year.  Four Las Virgenes winners have gone on to win the Kentucky Oaks: Fran's Valentine (1985), Goodbye Halo (1988), Lite Light (1991), and Blind Luck (2010).  Several other winners have beaten males in Grade I company: Serena's Song (1995) won the Haskell, Rags to Riches (2007) won the Belmont, and Beholder (2013) romped in the 2015 Pacific Classic.  You, most famous for winning the 2002 Test Stakes (GI) in a "photo finish that doesn't deserve a loser" over Carson Hollow, won the Las Virgenes as well.

<em>Beholder romps in the 2013 Las Virgenes Stakes.</em>

SONGBIRD ranks as the clear class of the field.  Her two-year-old speed far surpasses anything the rest of the field has been able to put up.  She is the speed of the speed in a field without any one-way speed.  Even if someone else decides to try and send, most likely either JADE PRINCESS or MERIROSVO, SONGBIRD has shown the ability to get the best of a contested pace, as she did in the Del Mar Debutante (GI) last year.  She has been working long and strong over the local course.  She gets regular rider Mike Smith back in the irons, and trainer Jerry Hollendorfer has a respectable enough win percentage off these long lays (17%, when off 90 days or more) to suggest that he should have SONGBIRD in good shape coming into here.

If SONGBIRD loses, whoever picks the winner will get paid.  However, sometimes the better part of valor lies in knowing when the chalk is the goods, singling, and moving on.  This looks like one of those times.  Though SONGBIRD is untested, she does not stand to get her test here.

STREET FANCY rallied to win the Starlet (GI) last out, after some early trouble.  She has proven herself to be a versatile sort so far.  She graduated first out from a forward placement, but finished a close third in the Desi Arnaz after rallying from the clouds.  STREET FANCY's maiden win came over the Santa Anita dirt, showing she can handle the surface, and her Starlet win last out came at two turns.  She has been working well leading into this race, and trainer Phil D'Amato has been striking at 22% this meet.  She does lose Mike Smith, but that can hardly be taken as a strike against her, as Smith shows up on SONGBIRD.  STREET FANCY does get Victor Espinoza -- previously JADE PRINCESS's rider, making the rider assignment perhaps a vote of confidence in that regard.  STREET FANCY may not be SONGBIRD, but she has shown enough to make her a solid favourite to fill out the exacta.

The other "logical" horse to consider for the "second to SONGBIRD" medal here is JADE PRINCESS.  She should be forwardly placed early, and does have two wins at the distance.  However, it has been feast or famine with her -- she has either won by daylight, or finished far up the track.  For what stands to be a short price in the exacta or trifecta pools, focusing on SHE'S A WARRIOR underneath instead makes a bit more sense.  SHE'S A WARRIOR remains a maiden, but she has been in the money in all three of her starts.  She also took a significant step forward last out, in her first try at two turns.  Though SHE'S A WARRIOR loses regular rider Mario Gutierrez to LAND OVER SEA, that raises no real red flags given how often Gutierrez rides for LAND OVER SEA's trainer Doug O'Neill.  SHE'S A WARRIOR gets a capable rider in Flavien Prat, and Prat has won two of his last four (with another in the money) for trainer Peter Eurton.  SHE'S A WARRIOR has been working well, she has form over the course, and she is fast enough to contend.  The value in the exotic pools lives with her.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#6 SONGBIRD (1/5)</strong>

<strong>#3 STREET FANCY (6/1)</strong>

<strong>#1 SHE'S A WARRIOR (20/1)</strong>

<strong><em>Gulfstream Park -- Race 12 -- Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap -- One and One-Eighth Miles on Turf -- post time 5:23 PM ET
</em></strong>

Generically named, the Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap is sometimes referred to by its initials of GPTH to differentiate it from the Gulfstream Park Handicap at a one-turn dirt mile later in the meet. The Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap has had other vanilla names in the past, but it's always been a grass race since its birth in 1986. Originally at a mile and a sixteenth, it was stretched out to eleven panels in 1990 and was gifted with Grade 3 status that year too. By the end of the 1990s, it climbed to Grade One status. Briefly stretched out to a mile and seven-sixteenths in 2006, it was turned back to nine furlongs in 2009 and ever since has been at a grassy mile and an eighth. Three hundred fifty thousand dollars is the purse. Past winners of note include double winner Einstein (2006,2008), whose wins sandwiched that of Arlington Million winner Jambalaya (2007). Another winner of note is 2000 victor Royal Anthem, the broodmare sire of Palace Malice - the same Palace Malice whose equipment change in the 2013 Kentucky Derby is the impetus of Nicolle Neulist's non-ChicagoNow space at <a href="http://blinkers-off.com/">Blinkers Off.</a>

Selections and analysis are "turf only".

SHINING COPPER blasted out to a ginormous early lead in the Breeders' Cup Turf when last seen, and wilted in the later stages of the race to finish eleventh.  Coupled with his fifth in the G1 Joe Hirsch Turf Classic, it appears the finish may be coming off of SHINING COPPER.  But in both races, he acted as the <em>de facto</em> rabbit for fellow Ramsey owned-and-bred production Big Blue Kitten, who needed a target and found himself winning the Hirsch and hitting the podium in the BC Turf.  This time around, there's no stablemate for him to set up.  But the race drew a dearth of pace and maybe Joel Rosario on SHINING COPPER plays a game of Catch Me If You Can on the Chad Brown trainee.  His first start off the layoff induces more of a chance to be keen.  Perhaps Ramsey is playing to win more in this spot than Papiese, and that's the trump card against the race's favorite, THE PIZZA MAN.  A cinch to be Illinois Horse of the Year, he's versatile enough to win at twelve furlongs (G2 Hollywood Turf Cup last out), at ten (G1 Arlington Million) and nearly beat the American milers (American milers should be ashamed of yourselves!) last fall at Keeneland (G1 Shadwell Turf Mile).  Distance is not the issue; the connections have pie-in-the-sky plans to travel to Dubai with THE PIZZA MAN and perhaps this race is the prep, not the goal.  Still, this corner would not be surprised should he annex this event.  ALL INCLUDED gets the nod for third in this spot.  His worse finishes in the fall in the G3 Knickerbocker and G3 Tropical Turf came when the half mile splits were slower than :50 - implying this is a runner that needs someone to do the dirty work up front.  The presence of SHINING COPPER helps a pace-dependent type like ALL INCLUDED.  And his wide trip last time out in the G2 Fort Lauderdale indicates he deserves another chance to show what his best form can be over this course.

Longshot: A longshot to watch for firm turf only, <strong>#3 TRIPLE THREAT (10/1)</strong><strong></strong>'s clunker of an Arlington Million (as well as last win coming over firm turf at Monmouth) show that maybe TRIPLE THREAT needs firm turf - and Gulfstream turf tends to run firmer than most (like Monmouth's).  It is possible that TRIPLE THREAT isn't a legit G1 horse, given his third in the G1-CDN Northern Dancer Turf took place in what's traditionally the softest G1 north of the border; this while he was in a lower finish position in more hickory G1s like the Arlington Million and Pattison.  But beyond THE PIZZA MAN and SHINING COPPER, the race's quality drops off considerably.  That delta from top-to-others and a potential pasteboard make TRIPLE THREAT - if the course is firm - a possibility.

<em><strong>Gulfstream Park -- Race 13 -- Donn Handicap -- One and one-eighth miles on Dirt -- post time 5:53 pm ET</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em>

Headlining Gulfstream's six stakes day is the last race of its card, the Grade One Donn Handicap.  They'll go nine furlongs here, a full circuit around the Gulfstream dirt.  Half a million dollars will be on the line in this event.  This race pays homage to James Donn Sr., who purchased the track in 1944 and later served as President.  First run in 1959, it was taken to the dirt in 1965 after time on the turf and fixed at the nine panel distance, aside from two runnings in the 1970s.  The Donn was given Grade One status in 1988 and typically has been run in late January or early February. And it's a staple of the older handicap division as well.  Notable dirt winners include four-time Horse of the Year Forego (1974), double winners Pistols and Roses (1993-94) and Cigar (1995-96), the latter of which has a G1 mile named for him at Aqueduct, Gulfstream stakes namesakes Skip Away (1998) and Harlan's Holiday (2003) and Illinois-bred Giant Oak (2011),.

A year ago at Gulfstream in a G1 race at nine furlongs, MSHAWISH was victorious.  That was the 2015 G1 Gulfstream Park Turf Handicap, and MSHAWISH was classy enough to hit the podium in the G1 Dubai Turf (nee Duty Free).  The connections experimented with him on dirt and finally got a chance to put him on dirt in the G1 Cigar Mile where he was an even fourth.  Still, the Todd Pletcher trainee will get the endorsement in the G1 Donn given past success at nine furlongs (won G1 GPTH, third in G1-UAE Dubai Turf). John Velazquez has the assignment as he makes his two-turn dirt debut in the Donn.  Winner last time at a one-turn mile in this race's local prep, the G3 Hal's Hope, he can be close to the pace but has enough rating/passing ability to not need to be leading all the way around.  Perhaps he presses off of Gulfstream-loving VALID and takes the cake in the Donn.  On paper, the race projects for VALID to be controlling speed - and he could be lone speed.  But FINANCIAL MODERLING could pose enough of an annoyance to soften VALID up - and the thinking is MSHAWISH gets the spoils over VALID.  But make no mistake, VALID is the controlling speed in this event and won the $100K Harlan's Holiday over the Hallandale dirt two back.  VALID loves Gulfstream, as his twelve starts over the local dirt have seen win six times and hit the board four more.  Controlling speed and horse-for-course are tough angles to deny (and this space would full endorse him should FINANCIAL MODELING scratch).  KEEN ICE's tour de force victory in last year's Travers came when there was a contested pace up front that set up his rally.  Perhaps if FINANCIAL MODELING goes with VALID early that scenario against comes to frutition, but KEEN ICE won't be helped if VALID is allowed to go solo on the front end. KEEN ICE is a defensive use at best, but he did show he can fire a representative race at nine furlongs when there was a legitimate pace in the Clark last year on Black Friday.  Though eligible for an N2X allowance, KEEN ICE was victimized by the lack of contested pace two back in the Breeders' Cup - further illustrating his limitations.  If you think FINANCIAL MODELING scrambles the pace he can get a share, but seeing him as a win candidate regardless of projected pace isn't in play in the G1 Donn.

The Martha Washington has been a fixture at Oaklawn Park since 1979.  Originally run at six furlongs, the race was stretched out to its current distance of a mile in 2004.  Only one filly has run in the Martha Washington and then won the Kentucky Oaks that year: Rachel Alexandra (2009), whose three-year-old season began with an eight-length win in this race, continued through not only an Oaks win but also three Grade I wins against males, and concluded with Horse of the Year and Champion Three Year Old Filly honours.  Two other Eclipse winners have won the Martha Washington.  Ambassador of Luck (1982) ran the distaff division in New York the following year, and took the 1983 Eclipse for Champion Older Mare.  The 2014 Champion Two Year Old Filly, Take Charge Brandi, notched the final win of her career in the 2015 Martha Washington Stakes.  She has since been retired, and will be bred to Curlin this year.

2015's Martha Washington also marked the three-year-old emergence of Sarah Sis, a filly who had marked herself as one to watch at Arlington the previous year.  The Ingrid Mason trainee finished a solid second behind Take Charge Brandi in the race, won the Honeybee, and won two more graded stakes as last year went on.  Team Sarah Sis will attempt to notch another strong Martha Washington performance this year, as Mason and owner Joe Ragsdale return this year with MARQUEE MISS.

<strong>Saturday, February 6 -- Oaklawn Park</strong>

<strong>Race 8: Martha Washington Stakes, three-year-old fillies, one mile on the dirt, post time 4:38pm CST</strong>

This race looks to have quite a bit of speed.  Though DURANGO is the only really one-way speed, MY MASTER PLAN is rarely far early, READY TO CONFESS does her best near the front, and even MARQUEE MISS and LOVABLE LYSS have shown some zip early.  With this kind of a setup, it looks like a beautiful situation for DORODANSA.  She has never finished worse than second in three starts at a mile, and has done her best from off the pace.  However, she does not need to be too far off -- particularly good if Oaklawn is playing as speed-friendly as it was for swaths of last week.  She already has a race over the track at the same distance as the Martha Washington.  Though she finished second, that was after a protracted duel with READY TO CONFESS.  If DORODANSA can make her move a bit later, she should be well set to mow the speedy types down.

It is still difficult to know whether MARQUEE MISS is going to like two turns, since both of her previous two-turn races have been flops.  However just about everything else about her is likable.  Both of those aforementioned route races came before the addition of blinkers.  Her one other try on a dry track with blinkers was a cracker: an open-lengths victory over DURANGO last out in the six-furlong Dixie Belle on January 15.  That was right here at Oaklawn, proving she can take to the surface, and she gets rider Channing Hill back in the irons.  Hill has been strong recently with trainer Ingrid Mason, as well.  In twelve starts together over the last two months, they have three wins (for a +$2.72 ROI), with six money finishes.  In terms of pace, she is versatile.  She posted a frontrunning victory last out, surviving a speed duel to kick well clear.  In her Arlington-Washington Futurity victory, she rallied from a few lengths off.  The off-pace style would make more sense given how this race looks on paper -- but, it did in the Dixie Belle as well, and she slugged it out on the front.  Being by Cowboy Cal out of a Marquetry mare who has produced another two-turn winner, there are no immediate red flags to suggest a mile will be a bridge too far for MARQUEE MISS.  All in all, she has a shot, and should be a square price given the money likely to be shoved at NICKNAME.

The aforementioned NICKNAME has not raced since the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies (GI) in October, where she was a well-beaten fourth.  However, she does not face the likes of Songbird and Rachel's Valentina here.  Two starts back, in the Frizette, NICKNAME won at a mile, albeit at one turn instead of two.  She should be forwardly placed, though she has shown the ability to win a speed duel or sit just off.  The plethora of frontrunners here does not help her, but it does not make her hopeless either.  She will be tough to take as the likely heavy favourite, particularly between the layoff and trainer Steve Asmussen's paltry 6% strike rate so far this Oaklawn meet.  However, NICKNAME is the class of the field, and makes sense as a defensive use in multi-race tickets.  If she comes back the same horse she was last year -- much less better -- she could win this.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selections:</span>

<strong>#5 DORODANSA (4/1)
</strong>

<strong>#6 MARQUEE MISS (10/1)
</strong>

<strong>#1 NICKNAME (8/5)
</strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Longshot:</span>  Trainer Donnie Von Hemel sends a pair into the Martha Washington.  Though MY MASTER PLAN is undefeated in four starts at Remington, <strong>#3 READY TO CONFESS (6/1)</strong> appeals more.  Both of these fillies shipped to Arkansas from Remington, a premier source of live horses this Oaklawn meet, but READY TO CONFESS has already racked up a win over the local oval.  She graduated third out at Remington, in her first try over two turns.  Though that came in the slop, the light was on, and READY TO CONFESS outgamed DORODANSA to take an allowance at a mile over the Hot Springs dirt.  With all of the other speed in the race, the Martha Washington should prove a bit tougher test than the allowance last out was.  But, she has shown enough gameness to be in with a shot.  In addition to the local win, READY TO CONFESS also gets regular rider Luis Quinonez back.  As Quinonez has also ridden MY MASTER PLAN in every one of her previous starts, this speaks loudly.
