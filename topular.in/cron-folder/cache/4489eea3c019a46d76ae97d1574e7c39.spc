<p>The work is done by R.S. Owens, <a href="http://www.rsowens.com/us/" target="_blank">an awards and gifts manufacturer</a>. Owens makes the Oscar statuettes, as well as awards for the Emmys, Grammys, and many others. I don&#8217;t know when I first learned that the Oscar statuettes were made here in Chicago, but it&#8217;s always struck me as an oddity. It seems incongruous that these gleaming symbols of Hollywood glamour come from an out-of-the-way corner of Jefferson Park, on the Northwest side of Chicago.</p>

Owens in Chicago.</p></div>
<h2>R.S. Owens &#8211; History and Practices</h2>
<p>R.S. Owens was founded 1938. Its founder and original owner, Owen Siegel, focused the company on the niche market of awards manufacturing. The firm works with existing designs, such as the Oscar statuettes, and can create original designs as well. Once the design is finalized, each award is manufactured through a process that R.S. Owens describes as &#8220;old world [in its] artistry and attention to detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every award has a mold and die created based off the agreed-upon design. The metal base of each statuette is heated until it reaches a liquid state, which you can see <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/made-in-chicagoland-rs-owens-and-the-oscars/524964/" target="_blank">here</a>. The viscous metal is then hand-poured into the molds and allowed to cool.</p>
<p>The specific process varies depending on the award, but each award gets some amount of buffing before a shiny metallic plating is applied. Each gets a base, usually made to give each statuette a specific weight, and a customized nameplate.</p>
<h2>Oscar Statuettes by R.S. Owens</h2>
<p>The Academy Awards are the premier awards show in American popular culture. As such, the Oscar statuettes is R.S. Owen&#8217;s most prominent work. The firm originally won the contract in 1983 and have manufactured every one of the Oscar statuettes since then. According to that ABC 7 report, each award takes eight hours to manufacture. R.S. Owens ships the 75 Oscar statuettes deemed to be of the best quality from Chicago to Los Angeles for each year&#8217;s ceremony.</p>
<p>The winners are not known by anyone but the vote tabulators at <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/pwc-and-the-oscars.html" target="_blank">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> until Sunday&#8217;s ceremony. So R.S. Owens ships name plates for every nominee. The Academy then attaches the winner&#8217;s after the announcement is made. Similar processes are done at R.S. Owens when they manufacture the Emmy and Grammy awards.</p>
<p>Despite the geographical and cultural distance, Chicago does have a <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/windy-city-in-theaters-chicago-in-the-movies/" target="_blank">long association</a> with the entertainment industry. Innumerable musicians, actors, and artists honed their craft in our area before striking out to Hollywood or New York, and some of course stick close to home. Yet industry events like movie premieres or world-wide TV events like the Oscars hangs their hat in Los Angeles. So it was fun, and maybe even a little validating, to discover that Leonardo DiCaprio might not be able to lift his Oscar statuette high without some help from good old Chicago.</p>
<p><em>Update &#8211; After we wrote this post, it was <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/post/oscar-statuettes-longtime-creations-chicago-based-company-will-now-made-new-york/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the statuettes are now being manufactured by a New York firm. It&#8217;s a shame to see a Chicago tradition end, but we&#8217;ll leave this up in commemoration of the decades of work R.S. Owens put in.</em></p>

<h2>What&#8217;s in the Bronzeville Name?</h2>
<p>The Bronzeville neighborhood sprang up around the turn of the 20th Century. There had always been African-American residents of Chicago, but only a relative few until 1870. That&#8217;s when many of the restrictions against African-American&#8217;s legal and property rights were lifted in Illinois. Though segregation was now against the law, most African-Americans still encountered widespread job and housing discrimination. That meant that the nascent community had to settle in a thin strip of land on the South Side.</p>
<p>This area was once the estate of famed <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2404.html" target="_blank">Senator Stephen Douglas</a>. In fact, the official community name is still Douglas. When African-Americans began to move in, the neighborhood quickly took on several racially freighted names. According to the Encyclopedia of Chicago, the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/171.html" target="_blank">neighborhood</a> was &#8220;alternately referred to as the <a class="standard" href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/140.html" target="_blank">&#8216;Black Belt&#8217;</a> or &#8216;Black Ghetto&#8217; and occasionally &#8216;Darkie Town.&#8217;” Honestly, it makes me livid to even read that last one. The racism encountered by these new Chicagoans must have been appalling. The discrimination and sometimes <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1032.html" target="_blank">shocking violence</a> from the Chicago&#8217;s white population would persist for decades.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, residents of the neighborhood did not take kindly to these derogatory names. The name &#8220;Bronzeville&#8221; was suggested by James J. Gentry, a theater editor for the <em>Chicago Bee</em>. He said that African-Americans&#8217; skin color was closer to bronze than black. The name was popularized by the <em>Chicago Defender</em>, a <a href="http://chicagodefender.com/" target="_blank">black newspaper</a> with nationwide circulation.</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Bronzeville&#8221; has thus been in common use since the 1930&#8217;s. The new name may have reflected a desire by the neighborhood&#8217;s residents to define themselves on their own terms.</p>

<h2>The Stroll and the Black Metropolis</h2>
<p>In its heyday, from the 1910&#8217;s to the 1940&#8217;s, Bronzeville rivaled Harlem as the cultural and political capital of African America. Bringing us to the next moniker associated with the Bronzeville neighborhood, the most famous are was called &#8220;<a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1212.html" target="_blank">The Stroll</a>.&#8221; This section of State Street, from 26th to 29th Streets, was famous for its bustling activity. Day or night, the Stroll was jammed with people who wanted to be at the center of the action. At its peak, the brilliantly illuminated lights and signs of the Stroll&#8217;s jazz clubs even led some to nickname it the &#8220;White Way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the Stroll&#8217;s energy was lent to it by geography. Bronzeville was a very small and densely populated neighborhood during the Great Migration. Racially biased housing policies meant that the neighborhood was squeezed into an area bounded by 22nd Street on the north, 51st street on the South, the Rock Island Railway (near today&#8217;s Dan Ryan Expressway) on the west, and Cottage Grove Avenue on the east. The neighborhood was only a mile wide, at the most. This limited space in which blacks could live thus gave it these nicknames of &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; and &#8220;Black Metropolis.&#8221; As the biggest thoroughfare in that narrow strip of land, State Street became the natural meeting point for Bronzeville&#8217;s residents.</p>
<h2>A Musical Theater Tribute to the Bronzeville Neighborhood</h2>
<p>2016 is the 100th Anniversary of The Great Migration&#8217;s start. One commemorations planned is <em>Chicago&#8217;s Bronzeville The Musical. </em>It&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.thechicagotheatre.com/events/2016/February/bronzeville-the-musical-at-the-chicago-theatre.html" target="_blank">one-night event</a> at the Chicago Theatre. The performance is at 7:30pm this Saturday, February 27th. The producers promise &#8220;a thought-provoking story that depicts testimonials, laughter, tears and voices of great courage that translates the experience of African Americans as they journeyed to Chicago.&#8221; Seats are still available as I write this, but they are going fast.</p>
<p>The impact of Bronzeville is two-fold. First, it&#8217;s impossible to imagine Chicago without the incredible contributions of its African-American community. Secondly, during its heyday Bronzeville was central to black culture and identity across the nation.</p>

<h2>Montgomery Ward and the Golden Age of Mail Order</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">600 West Chicago was constructed in 1908 by Montgomery Ward, the Chicago-based retail company. Ward&#8217;s was founded in 1872 as a dry-goods mail order business. They specialized in shipping goods to rural and suburban customer who could not easily come into a big city like Chicago to shop. In its heyday, the Montgomery Ward catalog offered both small essentials, like soap or clothes, and gargantuan products, like an entire house. Around the turn of the 20th Century, the company had outgrown its original operations in the Loop and decided to build its own corporate campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s where the building now known as 600 West Chicago comes in. Montgomery Ward built it in order to handle the massive work of receiving, processing, and shipping millions of catalog orders. It rises eight stories and hugs the North Branch of the Chicago River for over 1,000 feet. 600 West Chicago was the largest re-enforced concrete building in the world upon its completion. According to information from the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/realestate/new-roles-for-montgomery-ward-site-in-chicago.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116295128088216565" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, the commercial operations within this gigantic building were vast. In order to handle the shipping demands, 600 West Chicago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housed its own U.S. Post Office branch. To supplement that, the ground floor had a shipping platform with berths for up to twenty-four railroad freight cars. There were also miles of chutes, conveyors, and storage lofts for the goods being moved around inside the building. All of this was before the age of email, so the building had an interior infrastructure for getting message to different floors. Montgomery Ward hired couriers, nicknamed &#8220;pickers,&#8221; who would roller skate around the building to deliver messages and packages. You can see some of them in the photo below. Hearing about this always makes me think Disney will hear about this and create a <em>Newsies</em>-style musical about the roller-skating Pickers.</span></p>

<p>For decades, 600 West Chicago was home to the massive work of shipping and processing orders and storing goods. Eventually, Montgomery Ward left the catalog business in favor of department store retail. There was still enough shipping work to do that little changed at 600 West Chicago. In honor of its place in the commercial history of the country, 600 West Chicago was added to the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/chicago/c3.htm" target="_blank">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1978 and was designated a <a href="http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/landmarksweb/web/landmarkdetails.htm?lanId=1374" target="_blank">Chicago Landmark in 2000.</a></p>

<h2>600 West Redevelops and Diversifies</h2>
<p>By 2000 Montgomery Ward had fallen on hard times. Buffeted by competition from other department stores and the burgeoning online retail economy, Montgomery Ward went out of business and was liquidated in 2001. The closing of Montgomery Ward meant that all three buildings on its corporate campus &#8211; 600 West Chicago, the Administration Building from the 1920&#8217;s, and an office tower from the 1970&#8217;s &#8211; were sold to developers.</p>
<p>Today the buildings are a mixture of commercial, office, and residential units. Along with Groupon, other major tenants include the Big Ten Network, Wrigley, and Dyson. With the old Cabrini-Green site next door entering a similar redevelopment phase, 600 West Chicago is emblematic of the changes wrought by the past century on the Near North Side.</p>

<h2>Presidential History in Chicago #1. Dozens of National Conventions</h2>
<p>The history of US Presidents in Chicago goes back to 1860, when the Republican National Convention convened here and nominated Abraham Lincoln to be President. Since then, Chicago has hosted more Presidential nominating conventions than any other city. Fourteen Republican National Conventions and eleven Democratic National Conventions have been held in the city. There were also two more for Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s brief &#8220;Bull Moose&#8221; Progressive Party.</p>
<p>I found it incredible that the Democrats and Republicans sometimes held their conventions in Chicago in the same year. A few times, they even wound up using the same building a few weeks apart. Despite all those conventions, only two of the structures that held them are still standing. I&#8217;ll talk more about those survivors in a bit. The list below shows the lost structures that held national conventions, the party and year of those conventions, and the year the building was demolished.</p>

Designed by famed architects Adler and Sullivan, the Auditorium Building is a stop on our new <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/architecture-tours/1893-worlds-fair-walking-bar-tour-with-food/" target="_blank">1893 World&#8217;s Fair Walking Bar Tour</a>. It was the largest theater when built, making it a great location for super-large events.</p>
<p>In its first few decades, the Auditorium Building seems to have been catnip for US Presidents in Chicago. Grover Cleveland laid its cornerstone in 1887. The next year, the Republican National Convention met in its unfinished concert hall and nominated Benjamin Harrison for the Presidency. A year later, Harrison had won the Presidency and returned to dedicate the finished building. In 1912, President Theodore Roosevelt gave his famous &#8220;<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1912-republican-convention-855607/?no-ist" target="_blank">Armageddon</a>&#8221; speech while accepting the nomination of the nascent &#8220;Bull Moose&#8221; Progressive Party on the Auditorium&#8217;s stage.</p>

<h2>Presidential History in Chicago #3. CBS Chicago Hosts the First Presidential Debate</h2>
<p>The next major moment for the presidential history in Chicago was when the city hosted the first ever debate between major Presidential candidates. It was held at the old <a href="http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/1366/Former-CBS-Building.php" target="_blank">CBS studio</a> in Streeterville. The debate itself is the stuff of American political legend. Radio listeners thought Vice-President Richard Nixon won by a wide margin. TV viewers said that Senator John F, Kennedy had won. On TV,  Kennedy looked tan and handsome next to a sick and sallow Nixon. The divide in perception helped cement the enduring appeal and popularity of TV.</p>

Guardrails and Bridges</h2>
<p>Chicago hosted the 1996 Democratic National Convention at the United Center. Many of the delegates, visitors and journalists stayed in the Loop and commuted to the convention. The City decided that they needed to make the route from the Loop to the Near West Side look nicer. New candy-apple red guardrails were installed on a bunch of the bridges and ramps around I-90.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve often seen those red rails while driving. A closer inspection revealed that the rails incorporate the star insignia from the <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/chicagos-flag-more-than-stars-and-stripes/" target="_blank">Chicago flag</a>. You&#8217;ll see these decorated guard rails from the I-290 interchange to the Lake Street bridge. The stars also appear in the concrete of bridges.</p>
<h2>Presidential History in Chicago #5. Obama Campaign Offices</h2>
<p>President Barack Obama is the only Chicagoan to be elected to the White House. We know of course of his victory speech on Election Night in 2008 in Grant Park. We know of his house in Kenwood/Hyde Park. So where were his campaign offices?The 2008 offices were on the 11th floor of <a href="http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/1342756994/2-Illinois-Center.php" target="_blank">Two Illinois Center</a> and the 2012 campaign was took up an entire floor inside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Prudential_Plaza" target="_blank">One Prudential Plaza</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the 2012 campaign was the only time that a President&#8217;s re-election campaign had its main office outside of Washington. Both locations are just rentable office spaces. So there&#8217;s no visible reminder of the work that went on there. Despite that limited visibility, these offices drove Obama&#8217;s electoral successes.</p>

<p>These five facts about the US Presidents in Chicago underline the importance of our city. Chicago has been a political powerhouse from our boomtown years in the 1800&#8217;s to the modern day. The legacy of political power dots our landscape.</p>

Whether focused on art, nature, music or science, a student field trip in Chicago should be very special. Here is a handy guide for planning your student field trip.</p>
<div id="attachment_6685" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-6685 size-medium" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Students-Look-Up-Chicago-Detours-min-240x300.jpg" alt="activities best student field trips Chicago Loop Interior Architecture" width="240" height="300" srcset="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Students-Look-Up-Chicago-Detours-min-240x300.jpg 240w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Students-Look-Up-Chicago-Detours-min-208x260.jpg 208w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Students-Look-Up-Chicago-Detours-min-205x256.jpg 205w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Students-Look-Up-Chicago-Detours-min-100x125.jpg 100w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Students-Look-Up-Chicago-Detours-min.jpg 441w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">New and engaging activities make for the best student field trips.</p></div>
<h2 class="p1">#1. Do Something New for Students</h2>
<p class="p1">First of all, let’s rule out field trips that students may have already experienced or that parents could easily take them to in the future. Events like a student field trip have more impact when the participants feel like they&#8217;ll never be able to repeat the same experience. Teachers booking our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/private-tours/educational-student-tours-chicago/" target="_blank">student group tours</a> sometimes ask me for other ideas for their field trip in Chicago. Only if the group is from far out of the Midwest would I recommend the very respectable institutions like the Art Institute or the Field Museum. While these museums are infinitely engaging, students from the suburbs and the Midwest may have already been and will go again in the future.</p>
<h2 class="p1">#2. Make it active, educational and fun</h2>
<p class="p1">Secondly, the best student field trips have an activity that fulfills the grand triad: active, educational and fun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Passive activities can be fine,</span> as long as there is an interactive element that gets students thinking from new perspectives. <strong>Student bus tours</strong>, like our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/private-tours/educational-student-tours-chicago/" target="_blank">Jazz, Blues and Beyond</a>, might seem passive, since much of it is students sitting on a bus. However, we ask students questions about what they see. We also play an active listening game to get them actively engaged.</p>
<p class="p1">Other activities that fulfill this requirement could be <strong>a guided tour of a historic theater. </strong>I particularly appreciated the dynamic and detailed experience of the tour at the iconic <strong><a href="http://www.thechicagotheatre.com/tour.html" target="_blank">Chicago Theatre</a></strong>. <strong>A visit to an artist studio,</strong> such as at <a href="http://lacuna2150.com/" target="_blank">Lakuna Lofts</a>, is incredible for budding artists, though it works best for smaller-sized groups.</p>
<p class="p1">Considering trying <strong>a smaller or lesser known museum</strong> as they often offer more personal experiences. Years ago, I took some students to the <a href="https://smartmuseum.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Smart Museum of Art</a> on the University of Chicago campus. The museum educator there did an excellent job at asking students questions to help make contemporary art more fun and accessible for them.</p>
<p class="p1">For science field trips, I highly recommend getting up close and personal with the Chicago River! Both <a href="http://www.chicagoriver.org/programs/chicago-river-schools-network/field-trips/field-trip-activities" target="_blank">Friends of the Chicago River</a> and <a href="http://www.mercurycruises.com/science-is-fun" target="_blank">Mercury Cruises</a> offer <strong>ecologically-based student field trips that focus on the Chicago River</strong>. Students get to learn about water creatures, water monitoring, and maybe even slime!</p>
<p class="p1">What<em> doesn’t</em> fulfill this requirement? It surprises me when teachers want to take their students to Navy Pier. The amusement-park atmosphere can certainly be fun, but the best student field trips should teach something, too!</p>
<div id="attachment_7342" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-7342 size-full" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House.jpg" alt="Henry B. Clarke House museum student field trips" width="764" height="573" srcset="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House-347x260.jpg 347w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House-341x256.jpg 341w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House-167x125.jpg 167w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House-735x551.jpg 735w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House-100x75.jpg 100w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Henry_B._Clarke_House.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A student field trip to the Clarke House Museum can bring a history course to life. Photo credit: Wikipedia</p></div>
<h2 class="p1">#3. The Best Student Field Trips Will Connect with Curriculum</h2>
<p class="p1">Thirdly, teachers should connect their Chicago student field trip with topics from their classes. The activity could connect with themes that fit within the subject matter. A <strong>visit to the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/clarke_house_museum.html" target="_blank">Clarke House</a>, Chicago’s oldest building</strong>, could tie in with an American history course. Factory visits can fit into various science classes. For example, a physics class could <strong>visit Chicago&#8217;s last pinball factory</strong> at <a href="http://www.sternpinball.com/contact" target="_blank">Stern Pinball</a> (technicaly, it&#8217;s just outside Chicago&#8217;s city limits). The machines and colors are mesmerizing, and students actually get to learn how they work! Lots of <strong>music students like band groups love the aforementioned <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/private-tours/educational-student-tours-chicago/" target="_blank">Jazz, Blues &amp; Beyond</a> tour.</strong> The tour teaches them about how Chicago came to be such a hotbed for music. Students don&#8217;t just learn trivia and facts. Instead they hear the dynamic stories behind the people and groups of Chicago music history.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Our new <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/private-tours/educational-student-tours-chicago/#1893" target="_blank">1893 World’s Fair Walking Tour with Games</a></strong> gives an in-depth look at the beautiful remaining buildings in downtown from the era of famous World&#8217;s Columbian Exposition. This new walking tour incorporates educational games and the route weaves into historic buildings downtown. Group is divided into two teams. There are prizes, too!</p>
<p class="p1">Planning the best student field trips in Chicago will ultimately depend on the excellence of teachers who best understand the interests and passions of their students. Good luck planning your field trip, and let us know if we can be of any help!</p>

Gridlocked traffic and frigid temperatures are decidedly less delightful. Every activity we list here is indoors and easily accessible by transit.</p>

<h2>1. Museums</h2>
<p>The city&#8217;s museums lead off our list of winter things to do in the Loop. My favorite is the <a href="http://www.artic.edu/" target="_blank">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. The permanent collection spans millennia and includes art from around the world. The Modern wing is also a beautiful architectural space to visit. For me, it&#8217;s always worth going just to see Edward Hopper&#8217;s <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111628" target="_blank">&#8220;Nighthawks&#8221;</a> again.</p>

<p>Or you can go to the Museum Campus, accessible via an easy bus ride from State Street. All three museums down there are worth the trip, but the <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Field Museum</a> is my recommendation. The permanent displays are always worth a visit and it gets the biggest special exhibits in the city.</p>
<h2>2. The Union Station Headhouse</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m half-surprised this space still exists. Most commonly known for its Great Hall, the Union Station Headhouse feels like something you&#8217;d only find in <em>Lost Chicago. </em>The <a href="http://www.chicagounionstation.com/photo_gallery.html" target="_blank">Headhouse</a> takes up the whole block across Canal Street from Union Station&#8217;s main terminal. The Great Hall is historically a giant waiting room. You might remember it from the big shootout scene in <em>The Untouchables</em>. The original architectural plan called for a skyscraper to be built above the headhouse, but that never panned out. The best activity here, beyond taking photos, is to just sit, relax and people watch among the beautiful natural light. The monumental Neoclassical architecture will make you glad it&#8217;s on your list of winter things to do in The Loop.</p>
<h2>3. 9th Floor of the Harold Washington Library</h2>
<p>The top floor of our public library has a few cool things to do in Chicago. A permanent exhibit tells the story of the library&#8217;s namesake, a former mayor. Also the current temporary exhibition, &#8220;<a href="http://www.chipublib.org/news/straight-into-the-camera/" target="_blank">Straight into the Camera</a>,&#8221; shows photography of the people of Chicago&#8217;s neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The ninth-floor&#8217;s &#8220;Winter Garden,&#8221; like the Headhouse, is a public space illuminated with natural light. The <a href="https://www.chipublib.org/news/your-new-favorite-study-space-winter-garden-at-harold-washington-library-center/" target="_blank">Winter Garden</a>&#8216;s architecture inspires a calm and reflective atmosphere. It&#8217;s also a stark contrast to the musty stacks and heavy brick architecture you see in the rest of the building. This quiet public space is a peaceful refuge downtown for me.</p>
<p>And lastly, on the ninth floor you will find the library&#8217;s Special Collections, where you can view anything from Civil War artifacts to theater programs from the early 1900s.</p>

<h2>4. The Loop Interior Architecture Walking Tour with Pedway</h2>
<p>Not to brag, but our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/architecture-tours/interior-architecture-walking-tour-with-pedway/" target="_blank">Loop Interior Architecture Walking Tour with Pedway</a> belongs on any list of winter things to do in the Loop. The two-hour walking tour weaves through the insides of buildings and some of the Pedway system of underground tunnels. Because we&#8217;re mostly indoors, this tour still runs on those cold or snowy days when it feels like nothing in town is functioning. I&#8217;ve lead this tour when the air temperature was zero degrees and all the guests had a great time.</p>
<div id="attachment_3836" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Navigate-Pedway-System-Chicago-Tour-web-e1425505707857.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-gallery-z52h" title=""><img class="size-full wp-image-3836" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Navigate-Pedway-System-Chicago-Tour-web-e1425505707857.jpg" alt="architecture walking tour of pedway underground chicago" width="760" height="543" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Head into the Pedway with our map and you won&#8217;t need a compass.</p></div>
<h2>5. Wander the Pedway on Your Own</h2>
<p>Already been on the Loop Interior Architecture Tour? Didn&#8217;t manage to get a reservation before we sold out? Have no fear, because you can still mark this off your list of winter things to do in the Loop. Our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/chicago-travel-tips/chicago-pedway-map/" target="_blank">Pedway Map</a> lets you explore Chicago&#8217;s mysterious underground on your own. Launch a shopping expedition while you meander below Block Thirty Seven and Field&#8217;s. Or challenge yourself to explore the Pedway&#8217;s mazes underneath the New Eastside, which is the name for the new residential area just north of <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/secrets-underground-nature-above-maggie-daley-park/" target="_blank">Maggie Daley Park</a>.</p>
<p>Now get out there and enjoy yourself this winter!</p>

<h2>The &#8220;Public&#8221; of Public Art</h2>
<p>Last summer the designers of the Wabash Lights, Jack Newell and Seth Unger, launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackcnewell/the-wabash-lights-the-beta-test/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise the funds for the beta test. They explained why the project was looking for crowd-sourced donations to fund the beta test.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are Kickstarting this project because it&#8217;s important to us that The Wabash Lights be seeded by the public. Public art is often created by one, paid for by few, but meant for everyone. We want to reverse that notion and bring the voice of the public into our project as donors and also designers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to hear this statement of downtown public art coming from the people. Some of downtown&#8217;s other public art has been, as Newell and Unger say, commissioned and executed by a select few. As guests on our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/architecture-tours/interior-architecture-walking-tour-with-pedway/" target="_blank">Loop Interior Architecture Walking Tour</a> know, the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-picasso-story-story.html" target="_blank">Chicago Picasso</a> was carefully overseen by Mayor Richard J. Daley. He arranged for a $100,000 commission for Picasso from the Chicago Public Building Commission. The sculpture&#8217;s actual construction was paid for by three large charitable funds. That same method of top-down control is still widely used for public art commissions.</p>
<p>The Wabash Lights designers, on the other hand, will fund the complete installation through donations by corporations and foundations. Nevertheless, asking the general public for funding might speak to changing trends in the art world.</p>
<div id="attachment_7279" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-7279 size-full" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min.jpg" alt="Wabash Lights beta test " width="764" height="573" srcset="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min-347x260.jpg 347w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min-341x256.jpg 341w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min-167x125.jpg 167w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min-735x551.jpg 735w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min-100x75.jpg 100w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/Wabash-Lights-from-Under-min.jpg 764w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Wabash Lights will be programmable and run the length of the Wabash Street &#8216;L.&#8217; Photo Credit: Alex Bean</p></div>
<h2>Interactivity of the Wabash Lights</h2>
<p>The big hook of the Wabash Lights is the art installation&#8217;s interactive quality. Each LED light tube can have its display reprogrammed from the smartphones of passersby. The designers claim that each 1/2 inch section of the lights will be controllable. So if a pedestrian had a great day at work, she can turn a stretch of Wabash Avenue into a neon yellow reflection of their mood. Alternately, a street musician could create some mood lighting of his personal tastes for his street-corner stage. Eventually the Wabash Lights might turn this corner of the Loop into an attraction with its kaleidoscope of colors.</p>
<p>The full experience of the Wabash Lights will not be felt for a while yet. Plans call for the beta test to run for the next 6-12 months. In that time the lights will not be interactive. Instead, the designers will use the time to experiment with a variety of displays. Also they will troubleshoot any technological, logistical and design hurdles that spring up after installation and activation.</p>
<p>You can check out the Wabash Lights for yourself on Wabash between Monroe and Adams. The lights will turn on evening around dusk and stay on until 1 or 2 in the morning.</p>

<h2><strong>Mansueto Library</strong></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll start off with a building that was under construction when I was a student at UChicago. The <a href="http://architecture.uchicago.edu/locations/joe_and_rika_mansueto_library/">Joe and Rika Mansueto Library</a> was designed by Helmut Jahn, whose post-modern architecture can be seen all over Chicago, this glass domed space opened in 2011. The library consists of a airy and light-filled reading room at ground level and underground storage facilities for up to 3.5 million volumes. I&#8217;ve been in here a few times on visits back to campus. For me, the most striking thing about the building is how it contrasts with the neighboring buildings. The Victorian Gothic Main Quad is across 57th Street and next door is the Regenstein Library, a concrete building from the Brutalist school of architecture. Seeing them from inside the Mansueto makes it feel like you&#8217;re looking at the Earth from a spaceship.</p>

<h2><strong>Logan Center for the Arts</strong></h2>
<p>Across the Midway Plaisance from the Main Quads, the <a href="http://architecture.uchicago.edu/locations/reva_and_david_logan_center_for_the_arts/">Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts</a> was designed as a home for the university&#8217;s visual and performing arts programs. The building abuts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorado_Taft_Midway_Studios">Lorado Taft Midway Studios</a>, which was home to the titular Mr. Taft&#8217;s sculpting studios and has been on the National Register of Historic Places for 50 years. The Logan Center itself consists of a tower that soars above the Midway, multiple performance spaces and theaters, studios, set construction shops, rehearsal spaces, and classrooms.</p>
<p>Like the Mansueto Library, the Logan Center is an example of more contemporary architecture. Its saw-toothed roof mimics the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorado_Taft_Midway_Studios">Taft Midway Studios</a> and the facade irregularly breaks between glass and brick. The architectural look sort of reminds me of men who repeatedly comb and gel their hair up straight for fifteen minutes. The overall effect, though, has always reminded me of Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s <a href="http://www.franklloydwright.org/taliesin-west/plan-a-visit.html">Taliesin West</a> out in Arizona. That architectural style could hardly contrast more with the Gothic Main Quad a few blocks away.</p>

<h2><strong>Saieh Hall for Economics</strong></h2>
<p>I chose to end with this architectural example because it blends the old and new styles from across the rest of the University of Chicago campus. The building now know as <a href="http://architecture.uchicago.edu/locations/department_of_economics_and_becker_friedman_institute/">Saieh Hall</a> was originally constructed in the 1920&#8217;s for the the university-affiliated Chicago Theological Seminary. Its neo-Gothic architecture fit in with the Main Quads of the University of Chicago campus, though the soaring brick tower was always iconoclastic. The Seminary, and the much beloved Seminary Co-Op Bookstore moved into new spaces a few years ago. The university&#8217;s Department of Economics &amp; Friedman Institute for Research in Economics became the new tenants.</p>
<p>For this change, the building was given a postmodern renovation. I say &#8220;postmodern&#8221; because often this architectural style mixes old and new elements. Spaces were updated to modern standards and a new pavilion was added to tie the structure together. The ornamental neo-Gothic architectural style remains the dominant aesthetic with the glass, polished steel, and airy spaces of contemporary architecture making the building feel contemporary and functional. It&#8217;s an ingenious blending of old and new that I suspect will spread across campus quickly as it continues to evolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s working for Rick Steves like?&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard that question many times since I worked as one of his tour guides in Europe. Rick Steves and his partner, Trish, joined me for a tour with Chicago Detours this week. So I thought I&#8217;d answer a few of those common questions for our tour guests who use <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/europe">his books</a> for their trip to Europe or religiously watch his <a href="http://www.pbs.org/show/rick-steves-europe/">PBS show</a>.</p>
<p>I know Rick Steves because I worked for his company for over a decade. Before that, I had traveled in Italy and spoke the language. During college, I also briefly worked as an assistant tour guide in Italy for a different company. <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/">Rick&#8217;s tour company</a>, which is how his travel empire began, was then called &#8220;Europe Through the Back Door.&#8221; ETBD hired me as a guide to lead multi-day tours around the country. My background as a freelance journalist led me to work on updating his tour guidebooks about Italy.</p>
<p>The tours are a huge operation managed by an impressive team, but the books are an aspect of the business that Rick personally manages. Rick and I traveled together for four days of training so that I could update his best-selling Italy guidebooks. The tour guides also flew to the Rick Steves headquarters in Edmonds, Washington for an annual week of meetings and social events with Rick and his staff.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what working for Rick Steves is really like.</p>
<h2>Working for Rick Steves is Hard Work</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rick-Steves-Italy-2016/dp/1631211838" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-7154 size-medium" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-italy-168x300.jpg" alt="rick steves italy guidebook" width="168" height="300" srcset="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-italy-168x300.jpg 168w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-italy-70x125.jpg 70w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-italy.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a>As Rick and I walked around Florence, which is swarming with Americans, people seemed to expect Rick to be waiting around any corner. At the end of interactions with him, they would often say, &#8220;Have a great vacation!&#8221; Rick Steves is not on vacation. While his television show may suggest otherwise, the man is not sipping wine and nibbling on Spanish churros all day long. He is working really, really hard.</p>
<p>When I worked on the book updates with him, we were practically sprinting around town to see every hotel, restaurant, laundromat, museum, church and train station in the city. We worked from dawn until well past dusk. The day was also long when I worked as a tour guide, since it was full of activities. Being a leader for groups of up to 28 different personalities also had its challenges. To explain that in full would require much more than a blog post.</p>
<p>Rick&#8217;s tour company employs 80 full-time employees in the office. They manage the books, television and radio shows, tours and store. On top of that, the European tours employ more than 100 guides, who live around the world. You don&#8217;t build a company from the ground up by being on vacation. The man works. All the time.</p>
<h2>Rick Steves is Efficient as All Hell</h2>
<div id="attachment_7140" style="width: 281px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-7140" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-tour-company-min-300x200.jpg" alt="rick steves norway tour company" width="271" height="180" srcset="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-tour-company-min-380x253.jpg 380w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-tour-company-min-385x256.jpg 385w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-tour-company-min-188x125.jpg 188w, http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/rick-steves-tour-company-min.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rick Steves in his element.</p></div>
<p>I speak fluent Italian. While training with Rick, he asked me to interpret something for him to a restaurant owner. Rick wanted the restaurant owner to offer a special deal for readers of his book. While Rick said about five words, my interpretation took about five times as long to say. To communicate the phrase as an Italian would, I had to explain the idea and say the same thing in a couple different ways. He flatly expressed to me that he was not at all into the length of my communications.</p>
<p>Rick acquires and checks an enormous mass of information for his books. From working with him, I learned how when you have 50 things to do in a day, if each thing can take half as long, you can accomplish twice as much. As a small business owner, I have to be efficient. I am very grateful to have learned this.</p>
<h2>He is a Fun Dude</h2>
<p>For his PBS show, Rick has a very chill and friendly persona. Like any television personalities, his real character is not as watered down and wholesome. While he is easygoing, he is still pretty intensely hard-working, as mentioned above. Also, the guy can be pretty funny. You can get a better sense of this if you to one of his public speaking events, like his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYXiegTXsEs" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" target="_blank">Ted Talk</a>.</p>
<p>Or you can see Rick Steves dance at one of our tour guide parties a few years ago.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34k-LBa8qls" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
Rick has a great sense of humor. I also know because he laughed at my jokes when he came on our tour of <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/architecture-tours/interior-architecture-walking-tour-with-pedway/" target="_blank">architectural interiors</a> and the underground Pedway System <img src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>Rick Steves is Not a Total Stoner</h2>
<p>Yes, Rick speaks out about the legalization of marijuana.<img class="alignright wp-image-7152" src="http://www.chicagodetours.com/wp-content/uploads/working-for-rick-steves-marijuana-300x219.jpeg" alt="working for rick steves marijuana reform" width="232" height="170" /> His advocacy relates to burdens on our criminal justice system and the lost tax revenue that legalization might bring. It&#8217;s a no-brainer that the medical uses of it are vast. Rick&#8217;s ideas on <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick/social-activism-philanthropy/drug-policy-reform" target="_blank">drug policy reform</a> are very politically motivated.</p>
<p>But no, Rick is not toking a bong every morning before going to manage his huge business. Rick certainly has some hippie roots, but he is not a total stoner.</p>
<h2>He Treats His Employees Well</h2>
<p>When I began working for Rick Steves&#8217; tour company, I was really impressed how it seemed like almost everyone had been there at least a decade. After I got hired, it took me at least five years before it didn&#8217;t seem like I was a newbie. I initially trained as a tour guide with Dave Horelein, who does the awesome maps in the guidebooks, and he&#8217;s been working with Rick for 30 years.</p>
<p>Longevity in a company shows that Rick is doing something right. While any business owner has enormous support from his or her employees, it is the leader that establishes a company culture. I would describe the Rick Steves&#8217; company culture as casual, friendly, open, hard-working, liberal and smart.</p>

<p>I may not know him on a really personal basis, but this is what I&#8217;ve gathered from working for Rick Steves over the years. It was a great honor to have him take a break from the <a href="http://travelshows.com/shows/chicago/">Chicago Travel and Adventure Show</a> to come explore Chicago with me and ten other guests on our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/architecture-tours/interior-architecture-walking-tour-with-pedway/">Loop Interior Architecture Tour</a>.</p>

Located in the landmark district of the Loop&#8217;s Jewelers Row, the Pittsfield Building opened in 1927 as a mixed-use office and retail skyscraper. I popped in to the Pittsfield while leading an architecture tour this week. As I looked at the architectural details in its striking lobby, I thought about how the architecture of the Pittsfield Building is an example of the way structures can change and adapt across time.</p>
<p>To give you some background, the Pittsfield Building was constructed by the Estate of Marshall Field. The prolific architecture firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White designed it.<b> </b>Interestingly, Marshall Field III gave the Pittsfield Building to the Field Museum, which owned it until the 1960&#8217;s.</p>

<h3>Architectural Design of the Pittsfield Building</h3>
<p>The architecture of the Pittsfield Building was designed with two different commercial spaces. The upper floors, from 5 to 37, were professional offices for lawyers, dentists, and doctors. The lower levels, from the basement to the 5th, were for small retailers such as jewelers, restaurants, tobacco stores, and newsstands.</p>
<p>The lower levels were decorated in a &#8220;Spanish Gothic Revival&#8221; style with some Art Deco touches. The architectural style unmistakably recalls the 1920&#8217;s. When you step inside, the gilt elevator lobby ceilings are coffered into a maze-like hexagonal pattern. Continue entering, and the atrium soars five floors above you and is crowned with a gigantic chandelier. Every spare surface in the lobby and atrium seems to be covered in marble.</p>
<p>The effect of all the architectural ornamentation is stunning in its opulence and aesthetic appeal. Of course, that fits right into the flashy architectural approach that Marshall Field pioneered at his store, as any of our <a href="http://www.chicagodetours.com/architecture-tours/interior-architecture-walking-tour-with-pedway/" target="_blank">Loop Interior Architecture Walking Tour</a> guests can attest. It&#8217;s easy to see why the building was declared a <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Pittsfield_Bldg.pdf" target="_blank">Chicago Historic Landmark</a> in 2002.</p>

<h3>Contemporary Hurdles for the Pittsfield</h3>
<p>The architectural plan for the Pittsfield Building suited its time, but it faces some contemporary hurdles. Medical professionals and their patients prefer sparkly new facilities, meaning a loss of office rentals. The Pittsfield has made up for that loss by renting several of the floors to nearby universities as dorms. Another plan wants to turn some of the floors into a new hotel, but a <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20151125/CRED03/151129909/pittsfield-building-owners-sued-over-soured-91-million-in-deals" target="_blank">legal battle</a> between developers has that currently on hold.</p>
<p>A building this old also prevents a challenge for contemporary retailers. The architects&#8217; original plan put most of the shops in the atrium or basement. Those spaces still look beautiful, but most are vacant and seemingly forgotten. Most companies today prefer sidewalk-accessible storefronts or a presence in a mall with dozens of stores.</p>
<p>Chicago&#8217;s past is littered with examples of magnificent architecture that &#8211; like the Pittsfield &#8211; outlived their original architectural design. Some, like Louis Sullivan&#8217;s old Stock Exchange, met the wrecking ball. Others, like the Chicago Athletic Association, have been revitalized and repurposed. I&#8217;d prefer the latter for the Pittsfield Building, of course, but it will take a developer with big ambitions and deep pockets to see it all the way through.</p>
