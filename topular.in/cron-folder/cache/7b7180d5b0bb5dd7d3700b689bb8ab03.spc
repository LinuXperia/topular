Honestly, I didn't mean to eavesdrop as we were both vacuuming our cars today at the same service station, but I couldn't help overhearing you "encouraging" your special So &amp; So to get out of her slump and put air in the tires.

"Is it really that bad?" you hollered through the windshield, laughing. "I mean, seriously, come on. You've gotta shake this off!" When you draped the hose of the vacuum around your neck, Britney-Boa-Style, I chuckled.

But when she leaned her head against the passenger window, the heel of one hand pressed hard against her brow and the back of the other hand across her mouth, I recognized her silent struggle.

This got me thinking, in a less-than-happy-go-lucky way, how you weren't helping her at all, just shaming her into being happy like you.

And while I really don't know your special So &amp; So -- or how you got to be so Happy-Go-Lucky-ish, it seems to me she was <em>really</em> down -- and that you were really, truly, assertively <em>not</em>.

You see, I'm grateful that your So &amp; So's body language revealed her feelings, because depression presents in many ways: withdrawal; substance abuse, anger, self-harm. You seemed blissfully unaware of the brief eye contact I made with her, our wordless exchange translating to this:

Me: "You okay?"
So &amp; So: "Not really. This absolutely sucks. I can barely move."
Me: "Been there. I get it."
So &amp; So: "Any ideas on how to push <em>through it?</em>."
Me: [Tilting my head toward you with a gassy smile]
So &amp; So: [Dramatic eye-roll, implying I take both you and your…little hose]

Listen, Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky. It's clear that you're fully aware of what a positive attitude looks like to others, all happy and balanced and optimistic about the future. Believe me: I saw that positive attitude admiring itself in the shine of your Kia Sorento. And no, that wasn't sarcastic. The Sorento's a surprisingly cute car, and that tagline? "The Perfect Getaway Vehichle" -- it really suits you, Man. I don't know why. It just does.

But, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/2015/11/mother-daughter-dance-with-depression-christine-wolf-teen-adolecent/">as a 47-year-old mother still recovering from a major depressive episode while supporting her teenage daughter through her own struggle with depression</a>, today's <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2484345">statement issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which recommends screening every adult (18 and older) for depression</a> -- is more than just exciting, breaking news for people like So &amp; So and me. This news should also matter to you, and to everyone else you care about, especially since <a href="http://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers">there's a 1 in 5 chance you'll be touched by mental illness, too</a>.

According to the <a href="http://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers">National Alliance on Mental Illness, less than half (41%) of U.S. adults with a mental health condition received treatment by mental health services in the past year</a>, contributing to America's<a href="http://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers"> $193.2 billion in lost wages per year</a>. That's almost 8 million Sorentos getting away from Happy-Go-Lucky dudes like you.

And if you <em>still</em> don't care, or think this announcement doesn't affect your happy life, just remember there's a decent chance that at least 1 in 5 of your children's<strong> teachers, coaches, </strong>and<strong> guidance counselors </strong>have experienced, are currently experiencing, or<strong> </strong>will experience mental illness. One in five of your<strong> colleagues </strong>and<strong> supervisors, </strong>your<strong> doctors, dentists, </strong>and<strong> local government officials, </strong>your<strong> adult friends, family members, neighbors, </strong><strong>registered gun owners, unregistered </strong><strong>gun owners, </strong><strong>fellow airline passengers </strong>and<strong> commuter train passengers, </strong><strong>pharmacists, elected officials, clergy, Facebook friends, favorite authors, bloggers, <strong>auto mechanics, electricians, and firefighters. </strong></strong>And, 1 in 5 of the <strong>adult drivers sharing the road with you</strong> has experienced/is currently dealing with/will experience mental illness.

We're gonna get you, sucka. Just try and get away from us.

In fact, I've been one of those drivers sharing the road with you, and there were days over these last three months that you'd be glad you didn't know I was there. Days when I couldn't stop crying, couldn't feel happy, couldn't feel any hope. Days when I was still getting used to a new medication, hadn't slept well, felt consumed by my sadness. Days when I looked around at drivers like you, staring into your rearview mirrors, admiring your Happy-Go-Lucky smiles, oblivious to the traffic jams of my emotions gone awry and the standstill of self-loathing in my heart. These are things you could not see, nor could I see my way around. I'd have days driving near the holocaust museum, bursting into tears as it came into view, or over falling leaves, marking the end of a season.

I really feel for you, Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky, because I can see how depression would confuse you if you haven't experienced it yourself. Maybe So &amp; So feels general malaise all the time, or maybe it's only once in a long while. As a caregiver, you're understandably exhausted -- even exasperated -- by the unrelenting gloom, but how do you think it feels to be in her head?

I totally get why it's hard to support someone suffering through depression, especially if you've never personally experienced scorching, emotional pain. In a way, it must be like watching a car wreck happening and not being able to do a thing. Whether it plays out in slow-mo or in the blink of an eye, there's barely time to react until the crash is upon you (and just for the record, this same rule applies for the person who's depressed).

Perhaps your So &amp; So also sends you inconsistent SOS signals -- "I can't stand myself…and why don't you love me?" "I'm worthless…and you don't appreciate my value." "I'm so lonely…get away I'm unlovable."

I can only guess that helping her sometimes feels like you're bolting from your Sorento, running toward the overturned wreckage of her self-esteem, only to hear her scream at you from the driver's seat, "You? Now? Leave me alone! I don't need you, Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky. I need Jake from State Farm. He won't judge."

Depression, unfortunately, isn't a choice. No one welcomes it, and it's nearly impossible just to "shake off". If we could make it stop, we would, but we can't.

Picture your beautiful car as <em>depression</em>, and a fresh, icy blanket of snow <em>distorted thinking</em>. No matter how clean and tuned up you may be, you can't stop the snow from falling down. You see the clear road two feet to your left, but you're trapped -- less by the snow than by the <em>belief</em> you're stuck there forever. Your handy tools seem too cumbersome to bother digging out, and as you keep spinning and spinning and spinning your wheels, you loose traction and fuel and drive yourself downright crazy.

But when some well-meaning crackerjack like you (no offense) stands on the clear pavement doing a bellydance yelling, "Is it really that bad?" you're seriously not helping by stating the obvious.

<em>Perspective</em> is the antidote for <em>distorted thinking</em>, so sprinkle that <del>shit</del> salt all over that icy snow. Melt the stuff down, Dude. Reach into the window, crank that wheel a smidge to the left, then remain on standby while <em>depression</em> works its way out. Don't try to rescue or be the hero, even though God knows you deserve a medal. That will come later, after the melt. But if you can't understand this or can't follow these instructions, head to the nearest 7-Eleven, buy the latest issue of Hot Rod, and let the grownups figure life out.

Okay…my tough love rant is now over.

But you can stop beating yourself up. Depression isn't easy for anyone to understand, let alone manage.

I just want to make sure we both agree that, while a label certainly doesn't define the person, "depression" has a way of feeling like it does, thanks to our own cognitive distortions reinforced by frustration from others:

"I'm <em>Depressed</em>."
"Why am I so <em>Depressed</em>?"
"Why can't I stop being <em>Depressed</em>?"
"You're making me <em>Depressed</em>."
"Why am I the only one who's <em>Depressed</em>?"
"I shouldn't be <em>Depressed</em>."
"I should have realized sooner that I was feeling <em>Depressed</em>."

We "should" and "shouldn't" all over ourselves, to the point of believing we deserve to feel this bad…only to hear our negative thoughts echoed by others:

"She's <em>still</em> Depressed?"
"Will she <em>always</em> be Depressed?"
"Does <em>everyone</em> get that angry when they're Depressed?"
"I can't even <em>remember</em> when she wasn't Depressed."
"<em>How long</em> does it usually take for her to stop being Depressed?"
"<em>Are you serious</em>? You're actually Depressed over <em>that</em>?"

Look. It's not your fault you can't always be there for her in the ways that she needs, because so few of us are comfortable talking about this subject. And yet depression is real, and it's difficult -- for you and for her. Sometimes, the best way to coax her out of that rut or that wreckage  is to stand there, even as the gapers gawk, just showing her you're not grooving for the getaway today.

What depression does best is to test one's sense of trust -- in ourselves, in others, and in everything we know -- so it might take some patience before she presses the "unlock" button. She's not trying to be difficult. That's the worst part about depression. She doesn't want to be locked inside. She wants to be out there, vacuuming with your…little hose…but your Happy-Go-Lucky dance, to her, feels like a mockery. Between us, she's jealous as hell that you're pulling a Britney when she's glued to her seat. She wants to join you and breathe the diesel fumes all around us, but she can't. Just not right now. But she will. So for now, put down your little hose and just park yourself there, with your Happy-Go-Lucky-ness. Sooner or later she'll eventually signal she's ready. Just remember:  your Sorento was redesigned to be "<strong>Sleek</strong> and <strong>Strong</strong> And <strong>Adaptive To Your Needs</strong>," but when someone's depressed, they'll be anything but.

Oh, if you could only see how many of us struggle in silence due to stigma, more comfortable projecting our pride than accepting society's labels: <strong>Depressed</strong>; <strong>Overwhelmed</strong>; <strong>Unbalanced</strong>. These labels <em>are not who we are as individuals</em> -- they're just feelings -- and believe it or not, we already know that. But while logic tells us feelings are not always the truth, try explaining that to someone whose wife left him for another, or to the mother whose child has died of cancer, or to the young man who just lost his third job, or to the woman who cannot conceive, or to the man who numbs his pain with alcohol, or to the middle-aged mother who's lost her sense of self. These feelings of sadness and desperation are <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>real</strong></span></em>, and they're sneaky little buggers, like Smart Cars in your blind spot.

But I really don't want to trouble you, Mr. HGL, and I've taken up far too much time. I can only imagine how this subject matter's probably blown one of your gaskets. I just had to write to let you know how much I recognized your efforts to cheer your So &amp; So up, and that next time, the best thing you can do, if I may be so bold, is to consider depression for what it is: a journey best navigated through compassionate merging, rather than forcing someone into the fast lane.

Listen, Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky. It's clear that you're fully aware of what a positive attitude looks like to others, all happy and balanced and optimistic about the future.

I'd have days driving near the holocaust museum, bursting into tears as it came into view, or over falling leaves, marking the end of a season.

I really feel for you, Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky, because I can see how depression would confuse you if you haven't experienced it yourself. Maybe So &amp; So feels general malaise all the time, or maybe it's only once in a long while. As a caregiver, you're understandably exhausted -- even exasperated -- by the unrelenting gloom, but how do you think it feels to be in her head?

I totally get why it's hard to support someone suffering through depression, especially if you've never personally experienced scorching, emotional pain. In a way, it must be like watching a car wreck happening and not being able to do a thing. Whether it plays out in slow-mo or in the blink of an eye, there's barely time to react until the crash is upon you (and just for the record, this same rule applies for the person who's depressed).

Perhaps your So &amp; So also sends you inconsistent SOS signals -- "I can't stand myself…and why don't you love me?" "I'm worthless…and you don't appreciate my value." "I'm so lonely…get away I'm unlovable."

I can only guess that helping her sometimes feels like you're bolting from your Sorento, running toward the overturned wreckage of her self-esteem, only to hear her scream at you from the driver's seat, "You? Now? Leave me alone! I don't need you, Mr. Happy-Go-Lucky. I need Jake from State Farm. He won't judge."

Depression, unfortunately, isn't a choice. No one welcomes it, and it's nearly impossible just to "shake off". If we could make it stop, we would, but we can't.

Picture your beautiful car as <em>depression</em>, and a fresh, icy blanket of snow <em>distorted thinking</em>. No matter how clean and tuned up you may be, you can't stop the snow from falling down. You see the clear road two feet to your left, but you're trapped -- less by the snow than by the <em>belief</em> you're stuck there forever. Your handy tools seem too cumbersome to bother digging out, and as you keep spinning and spinning and spinning your wheels, you loose traction and fuel and drive yourself downright crazy.

But when some well-meaning crackerjack like you (no offense) stands on the clear pavement doing a bellydance yelling, "Is it really that bad?" you're seriously not helping by stating the obvious.

<em>Perspective</em> is the antidote for <em>distorted thinking</em>, so sprinkle that <del>shit</del> salt all over that icy snow. Melt the stuff down, Dude. Reach into the window, crank that wheel a smidge to the left, then remain on standby while <em>depression</em> works its way out. Don't try to rescue or be the hero, even though God knows you deserve a medal. That will come later, after the melt. But if you can't understand this or can't follow these instructions, head to the nearest 7-Eleven, buy the latest issue of Hot Rod, and let the grownups figure life out.

Okay…my tough love rant is now over.

But you can stop beating yourself up. Depression isn't easy for anyone to understand, let alone manage.

I just want to make sure we both agree that, while a label certainly doesn't define the person, "depression" has a way of feeling like it does, thanks to our own cognitive distortions reinforced by frustration from others:

"I'm <em>Depressed</em>."
"Why am I so <em>Depressed</em>?"
"Why can't I stop being <em>Depressed</em>?"
"You're making me <em>Depressed</em>."
"Why am I the only one who's <em>Depressed</em>?"
"I shouldn't be <em>Depressed</em>."
"I should have realized sooner that I was feeling <em>Depressed</em>."

We "should" and "shouldn't" all over ourselves, to the point of believing we deserve to feel this bad…only to hear our negative thoughts echoed by others:

"She's <em>still</em> Depressed?"
"Will she <em>always</em> be Depressed?"
"Does <em>everyone</em> get that angry when they're Depressed?"
"I can't even <em>remember</em> when she wasn't Depressed."
"<em>How long</em> does it usually take for her to stop being Depressed?"
"<em>Are you serious</em>? You're actually Depressed over <em>that</em>?"

Look. It's not your fault you can't always be there for her in the ways that she needs, because so few of us are comfortable talking about this subject. And yet depression is real, and it's difficult -- for you and for her. Sometimes, the best way to coax her out of that rut or that wreckage  is to stand there, even as the gapers gawk, just showing her you're not grooving for the getaway today.

What depression does best is to test one's sense of trust -- in ourselves, in others, and in everything we know -- so it might take some patience before she presses the "unlock" button. She's not trying to be difficult. That's the worst part about depression. She doesn't want to be locked inside. She wants to be out there, vacuuming with your…little hose…but your Happy-Go-Lucky dance, to her, feels like a mockery. Between us, she's jealous as hell that you're pulling a Britney when she's glued to her seat. She wants to join you and breathe the diesel fumes all around us, but she can't. Just not right now. But she will. So for now, put down your little hose and just park yourself there, with your Happy-Go-Lucky-ness. Sooner or later she'll eventually signal she's ready. Just remember:  your Sorento was redesigned to be "<strong>Sleek</strong> and <strong>Strong</strong> And <strong>Adaptive To Your Needs</strong>," but when someone's depressed, they'll be anything but.

Oh, if you could only see how many of us struggle in silence due to stigma, more comfortable projecting our pride than accepting society's labels: <strong>Depressed</strong>; <strong>Overwhelmed</strong>; <strong>Unbalanced</strong>. These labels <em>are not who we are as individuals</em> -- they're just feelings -- and believe it or not, we already know that. But while logic tells us feelings are not always the truth, try explaining that to someone whose wife left him for another, or to the mother whose child has died of cancer, or to the young man who just lost his third job, or to the woman who cannot conceive, or to the man who numbs his pain with alcohol, or to the middle-aged mother who's lost her sense of self. These feelings of sadness and desperation are <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>real</strong></span></em>, and they're sneaky little buggers, like Smart Cars in your blind spot.

But I really don't want to trouble you, Mr. HGL, and I've taken up far too much time. I can only imagine how this subject matter's probably blown one of your gaskets. I just had to write to let you know how much I recognized your efforts to cheer your So &amp; So up, and that next time, the best thing you can do, if I may be so bold, is to consider depression for what it is: a journey best navigated through compassionate merging, rather than forcing someone into the fast lane.

I do.
And it sucks.
And it's forever.
And I've had it with how many people won't talk about this shit.

Eight years ago, when I set out to spend a year writing, I'd been teaching preschool, feeling pretty darn happy with my life. Well, at least as happy as I thought I could be as a preschool teacher surrounded by happy children and engaged parents and colorful pictures and songs and books and GOODNESS.

But something inside was missing. Something I couldn't easily identify, a longing, of sorts, to tell a different story.

I'd already read so many stories to my students -- tales that brought them joy and laughter, about themes that explained the world. Colorful, predictable, surprising, unexpected. Every story was a metaphor for life and how to navigate it. So what story did I need to tell?

Writing experts advise to write what we know, but as I started I thought, "Well, the one thing I know like the back of my hand is what life feels like living with depression."

[insert laughter here]

<em>Nah</em>, I thought. <em>That's the last thing people want to read about. That's too sad. That's too gloomy. That's just way too waah waah waaaaahhhh. That's not fun. That's not uplifting. That's not a book someone would <strong>grab</strong>. </em>

<em></em>Back then, I thought my goal was all about getting published. <em>Forget the idea of a book about depression! You're 40 years old! Write something positive and powerful. Something unique and memorable and worth a second read.</em>

I decided I should tell a story that INSPIRED someone. Something about survival and stability and finding one's anchor when life feels adrift.

[caption id="attachment_3822" align="alignleft" width="215"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-12.53.17-AM.png"><img class="wp-image-3822 " alt="seanheritage.com" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-29-at-12.53.17-AM.png" width="215" height="225" /></a> seanheritage.com[/caption]

And so, I wrote a children's novel about a girl on a sailboat. A fictional tale. And it was the slowest, hardest, most painful thing I've ever done (except for giving birth, but still, really, really tough).

And for the past 8 years, I've been working and reworking and reworking that novel.

Don't get me wrong. I love that book. And I WILL publish it, even if it's only on a dare or because someone bets me a dollar that I won't go through with it. Just watch me. I'll pull all 40 drafts off my laptop and self publish every one of them just to prove how quickly and easily anyone can publish anything these days...because I really did learn a lot more than just how to write a novel in these past 8 years. The publishing landscape sort of exploded before my eyes...

..But that just wasn't the story I was meant to write. And I've never been more sure of that than I am right now, because I've discovered something along this journey:

You don't decide what to write about. If you're open and willing, your heart tells you what to write, and your fingers just start flying. And that's what's happening right now. I'm sitting at my dining room table in the middle of an ice storm avoiding paying my bills and telling myself it's time to go to bed and BAM. It's time. Not 8 years ago. Not someday. Now. Wo here goes nothing. (I actually meant to write "<strong>So</strong> here goes nothing," but I'm digging the <em>Wo, </em>so the <em>Wo</em> shall stay.)

The story I need to tell is one that no one seems to talk about,
because everyone's assuming no one ever wants to talk about it,
but what they're really all doing is just whispering about it anyway,
so let's ask ourselves why we're whispering about it and make this thing happen.
Seriously.

<em>Wo.</em>

This story of mine is called WHY ARE WE WHISPERING? and it's all about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>living with</strong></span> and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>covering up</strong></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rising above</strong></span> <strong>depression</strong>. It isn't a story I've actually written YET, but you'd get to Ride the Waves with me (wink wink) as I create it and share it, word by word, on this blog. I don't know about you, but I'm sensing an adventure. C'mon. Whaddya say?

To be fair, there ARE people out there talking about depression and writing about depression and even shouting about depression. Yet I think the whispers continue because the stories aren't shared in the grocery stores and on the playgrounds and in schools or in homes without judgment. Depression is still perceived as a character flaw and a weakness rather than what it is: a medical condition and a disability.

My story's about not being defined by depression and not being ashamed of it. It's about how I've struggled with it, how I've learned to talk about it and why I think we all need to know about it.

For me, depression is so, SO much more than sadness. It's a trillion times heavier than feeling totally bummed out.

Depression's like wearing a hooded, full-body x-ray blanket from the dentist's office

<del>Amy Schumers</del>

That's what depression feels like. For me. <em>Wo. </em>

You feel like you're the <em>only</em> one.
Like no one's got it as hard as you.
Like everyone else is so happy and adjusted and oblivious to the sadness in the world, while you're the unlucky one who's lucid enough to see how bad things really are but you're just too damn tired to make the announcement. In other words, you're the designated driver and you want to go home instead of having to clean up this fricking mess and chase these assholes down and get them all home safe. It's not fair and you just want to leave, but you know that's not cool and it'll only make things worse. So what you end up doing is chiding yourself for being so negative. You find yourself avoiding everything and everyone, including friends and family and tasks and self-care and work and life.

And it hurts like nothing you've ever experienced and you're convinced it will never, ever feel normal or good or happy or colorful again.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoidance</span> becomes your closest confidant.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shame</span> is the cigarette you'd sneak out back -- that is, <strong>if</strong> you smoked, but you don't, which is good, because depression kills more people than cigarettes.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weakness</span> is the hammock you just can't wait to curl up into.
And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Loathing</span> is the only one willing to rock you to and fro. Again, <em>Wo.</em>

So for tonight, that's all I've got. And maybe there isn't a market for this kind of stuff. Maybe I should stick with the children's book and consider myself cured of this wacky quest to share my story.

But maybe there's something to this, and if so, I hope you'll let me know. Right now I have to go to bed, then dig out the car and drive myself to my treatment program.

But, and this is a big but (and really so much bigger than Fat Amy's butt), if I come back tomorrow and see more than 40 likes on this post, I'll know I'm on the right track and that I just might have my work cut out for me.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48HqBv5Ropo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, and a thousand thanks to Fat Amy for the use of her girth to strengthen my analogy. I needed someone funny AND large, and you were the obvious choice. Apologies to Kristin Wiig, Amy Shumer, and Melissa McCarthy, to whom I suggest eating a sandwich and remaining hilarious.

Sincerely,

Christine

You feel like you're the <em>only</em> one.
Like no one's got it as hard as you.
Like everyone else is so happy and adjusted and oblivious to the sadness in the world, while you're the unlucky one who's lucid enough to see how bad things really are but you're just too damn tired to make the announcement. In other words, you're the designated driver and you want to go home instead of having to clean up this fricking mess and chase these assholes down and get them all home safe. It's not fair and you just want to leave, but you know that's not cool and it'll only make things worse. So what you end up doing is chiding yourself for being so negative. You find yourself avoiding everything and everyone, including friends and family and tasks and self-care and work and life.

And it hurts like nothing you've ever experienced and you're convinced it will never, ever feel normal or good or happy or colorful again.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoidance</span> becomes your closest confidant.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shame</span> is the cigarette you'd sneak out back -- that is, <strong>if</strong> you smoked, but you don't, which is good, because depression kills more people than cigarettes.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weakness</span> is the hammock you just can't wait to curl up into.
And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Loathing</span> is the only one willing to rock you to and fro. Again, <em>Wo.</em>

So for tonight, that's all I've got. And maybe there isn't a market for this kind of stuff. Maybe I should stick with the children's book and consider myself cured of this wacky quest to share my story.

But maybe there's something to this, and if so, I hope you'll let me know. Right now I have to go to bed, then dig out the car and drive myself to my treatment program.

But, and this is a big but (and really so much bigger than Fat Amy's butt), if I come back tomorrow and see more than 40 likes on this post, I'll know I'm on the right track and that I just might have my work cut out for me.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48HqBv5Ropo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, and a thousand thanks to Fat Amy for the use of her girth to strengthen my analogy. I needed someone funny AND large, and you were the obvious choice. Apologies to Kristin Wiig, Amy Shumer, and Melissa McCarthy, to whom I suggest eating a sandwich and remaining hilarious.

Sincerely,

Christine

November 22, 2015

Exactly one week ago today, I flew to Vermont with my husband and our 15-year-old daughter. We left her two brothers and the two dogs behind, and the impromptu trip took us nearly 1,000 miles from our home in Evanston, Illinois --  though not to witness the splendors of a leafy, New England fall. We'd gone to Vermont to help free our daughter from the suffocating grip of her severe depression.

For years now she's been struggling, in ways we've understood and have not, and after exhausting every therapeutic option close to home, we suddenly found ourselves in a desperate, free-falling scramble...inquiring, interviewing and listening...until we identified an intensive residential program in Vermont with a team we felt we trusted. Relying only on phone calls, emails, referrals and other parents' assurances, we concluded this was the place for our daughter. <em>If we bring her there</em>, we reasoned, <em>we'll have the greatest chance of bringing her back.</em>

And so, last weekend in Vermont, following an excruciatingly brief goodbye orchestrated by her new therapists, my feet somehow carried me through that graveled parking lot and into our rental car. The only sensation was a tearful emptiness, rising uncontrollably like the nearby Mad River -- what a horribly ironic name considering its proximity to therapeutic programming for people struggling with mental illness. Vermont's Mad River, with its history of swift and significant flooding, was once described in 1882 by a local resident as "sudden anger, overflowing its banks and devouring them at will” (Vermont Geological Society, 2003). And still, the Mad River's value is known by locals and vacationers alike for, above all else, its spectacular beauty...

As my husband drove us back toward the Burlington airport -- just the two of us now, instead of 3 -- I asked myself, <em>"<em>Who else but a mother like me could fail her child so clearly and painfully? </em>Who even does this </em><em>and how have I allowed this to happen? How does a family like ours ever recover?"</em>

Our wordless drive to the airport -- away from our daughter -- was the most difficult journey I have ever known. Heaving sobs like an uncontrolled cough, my worry, my pain and my tears trailed my sorrow as we drove further and further away from the child we brought home from the hospital on Christmas Day. Visions of her brave, final smile flashed beneath my swollen lids which dried only momentarily after I'd cried myself to sleep.

Once we parked the rental car and crossed the threshold into the terminal, the waves of regret consumed me. Leaning my head against a brick wall, I could not take another step. <em>What have I done? What am I doing? </em>My husband, through his own agony, reached out to comfort me, and though I desperately wanted and needed his comfort, I pushed him away, shredded and devastated.

As our plane sped down the runway and cast us into the air, my body -- having carried this child within the solemn space near my heart -- was pulled, dragged back toward the earth where I'd just left her. My fingers on the window paid no heed to my pooling tears as the jet engines seemed to whisper compared to the sound of her voice in my head: <em>Don't leave me here. I am so alone.</em>

<strong>My baby girl.
My love.
How I know this pain and cannot bear to leave you.
</strong><strong>How are you in this moment?
</strong><strong>I miss you. I ache for you.
</strong><strong>I want to ease your pain.</strong>

<em>It's been one week since we left you among those beautiful rolling hills in the pine tree woods, a place you've never been. Has this also been the longest week you've ever known? Do we look up to the stars and see the very same glow? Each twinkle in the darkness is a reflection of your sparkling eyes. Don't cry. Please don't cry.
</em>

<em>Just one week ago, our ears were filling and popping as Dad drove along those winding, ascending roads toward that space on earth that is now your temporary home. Remember how we used to read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goodnight, Moon</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There's a Monster At The End Of This Book</span>? Remember how you asked for spelling words to practice, just so you could be like your big brother who'd already started school? Remember holding your baby brother so sweetly, cradling his head with those perfect fingers, the ones you'd one day use to write and type and edit your feelings in journals and blogs? Remember how you pointed through the car window in Vermont, up toward the starry sky? Remember how you said to Dad and me, "Some of those stars have been dead for so long now...we only see their light because they're just so far away." Please, my baby girl, just keep looking up. </em>

<em>Keep your eyes on the light, no matter how dark the surroundings,
no matter how long gone they might be.
Whether or not there is life in those lights,
there <strong>is</strong> always hope.
So use that hope to find another star...
the very one I'm looking at tonight
as I think of you,
always,
while we're so far away.</em>

I certainly wasn't a middle-school mover-and-shaker, but I had more questions than any one parent, teacher or friend (yup, singular) could handle:

How am I supposed to sit at lunch when all the tables are full?
What do I do when two of my classmates hate each other but always ask me to say who I like best?
How do I tell a teacher I can't understand her handwriting?
Is this my week to be the after-school crossing guard? Where do I pick up my orange vest and the STOP sign?
Why does my P.E. teacher keep calling me the wrong name, then yelling when I don't answer?
Can a 7th grader run for student council?
Am I the only one who spends every other weekend at her dad's house?

It never occurred to me to bother the school social worker, the school psychologist or (God forbid) a busy teacher, because I always had my guidance counselor in my corner.

Sam Hanasz was that person -- the one adult at school I could always approach with any question, big or small, and not feel like a kid.

A group of us met once a week with Mr. H for half of our lunch hour -- just hanging out, talking, and being ourselves. The relationship was organic, relaxed, and comfortable. It provided a sort of anchor during busy weeks of rotating classes and faces and assignments and moods.

If I felt like crying, I knew I could get a pass to see Mr. Hanasz.
If I got a great grade, I'd want to tell Mr. Hanasz.
If my day went to hell, I'd leave a note on Mr. Hanasz's desk.
Walking through the hall, lost in my own thought, Mr. Hanasz would tap my shoulder with a laugh: "Earth to Chrissy."
When my best friend Amy's father died suddenly of a heart attack, my Language Arts teacher relayed a note from Mr. Hanasz the first day after it happened: "I'm so sorry. Stop by if you want to talk."

I didn't learn as much about him as I shared about myself; unfortunately, that's what egocentric middle-schoolers do -- obsess about themselves. But Mr. H made sure we got to know our peer group through ice-breakers and games and good old-fashioned conversation. We talked about how things were going...what our week's highlights (and lowlights) were...who was on our "good" list...and who was driving us bonkers. Our little advisory group gave us opportunities to catch our breath...take note of others...express vulnerable feelings without apprehension. Mr. H modeled empathy and fostered friendships, and only one word describes how he did it all so effortlessly: Magic.

I never appreciated Mr. H as much as I do now, since we live in a school district that eliminated guidance counselors years ago, supposedly due to budget constraints. Although students can make appointments anytime with school psychologists and/or social workers, they miss that essential, supportive, approachable layer of a guidance counselor in their day-to-day lives.

Clearly, my middle-school questions weren't life-threatening, but to my 12 and 13-year-old self-confidence, navigating that social-emotional minefield was a journey fraught with risk of ruining a day, a week, a semester, a reputation, a psyche.

In the 1980's, my guidance counselor lent unconditional support, yet I think today's middle school students need more support than ever.

Imagine being 12, juggling smartphones, Instagram, and Body Mass Index testing. Imagine opening the paper or (more likely) reading a column online about another mass shooting while gulping down a bowl of cereal.

To be sure, there are those who will argue that my generation coddles kids and that we need to let them build their own resolve and self-confidence -- and I couldn't agree more. But these days, when students have questions that might not fit neatly into boxes marked "academics" or "emotional emergencies", to whom do they turn?

For those students fortunate/confident/willing enough to connect with a trusted teacher or administrator, life is certainly good. Other students might reach out to social workers or psychologists with ease -- or at the very least, receive the encouragement of a parent or staff member. But for the students like my younger self -- tiptoeing through the "What if's" and the "I'm just not sure's" -- every question feels like a gamble. A risk. A chance to blow the whole world apart.

And although we've come a long way in our identification and demystification of social-emotional struggles, there's still a stigma -- felt by many middle school kids -- about being seen with the school's social worker/psychologist. And so until educational institutions foster the sense in every student that it's okay to stop by their offices, kids these days often suffer in silence rather than have their peers see them fraternizing with these professionals.

I've worked with enough middle-schoolers to hear the ongoing narrative:

"If I stop by the social worker's office, everyone will think I'm having trouble."
"Only the kids with problems go there."
"It's just not that big of a deal."

Obviously these statements aren't always true, but try telling that to the middle-school student doing anything and everything not to "stand out".

Kids have more to handle than ever before, and they deserve our unconditional support whether they succeed or fail. Their journey is often challenging, so why must we eliminate guidance?

Sam Hanasz, my guidance counselor, was there for me even when I didn't ask him for help. But just knowing I COULD reach out at any time without question made all the difference in the world.

I certainly wasn't a middle-school mover-and-shaker, but I had more questions than any one parent, teacher or friend (yup, singular) could handle:

How am I supposed to sit at lunch when all the tables are full?
What do I do when two of my classmates hate each other but always ask me to say who I like best?
How do I tell a teacher I can't understand her handwriting?
Is this my week to be the after-school crossing guard? Where do I pick up my orange vest and the STOP sign?
Why does my P.E. teacher keep calling me the wrong name, then yelling when I don't answer?
Can a 7th grader run for student council?
Am I the only one who spends every other weekend at her dad's house?

It never occurred to me to bother the school social worker, the school psychologist or (God forbid) a busy teacher, because I always had my guidance counselor in my corner.

Sam Hanasz was that person -- the one adult at school I could always approach with any question, big or small, and not feel like a kid.

A group of us met once a week with Mr. H for half of our lunch hour -- just hanging out, talking, and being ourselves. The relationship was organic, relaxed, and comfortable. It provided a sort of anchor during busy weeks of rotating classes and faces and assignments and moods.

If I felt like crying, I knew I could get a pass to see Mr. Hanasz.
If I got a great grade, I'd want to tell Mr. Hanasz.
If my day went to hell, I'd leave a note on Mr. Hanasz's desk.
Walking through the hall, lost in my own thought, Mr. Hanasz would tap my shoulder with a laugh: "Earth to Chrissy."
When my best friend Amy's father died suddenly of a heart attack, my Language Arts teacher relayed a note from Mr. Hanasz the first day after it happened: "I'm so sorry. Stop by if you want to talk."

I didn't learn as much about him as I shared about myself; unfortunately, that's what egocentric middle-schoolers do -- obsess about themselves. But Mr. H made sure we got to know our peer group through ice-breakers and games and good old-fashioned conversation. We talked about how things were going...what our week's highlights (and lowlights) were...who was on our "good" list...and who was driving us bonkers. Our little advisory group gave us opportunities to catch our breath...take note of others...express vulnerable feelings without apprehension. Mr. H modeled empathy and fostered friendships, and only one word describes how he did it all so effortlessly: Magic.

I never appreciated Mr. H as much as I do now, since we live in a school district that eliminated guidance counselors years ago, supposedly due to budget constraints. Although students can make appointments anytime with school psychologists and/or social workers, they miss that essential, supportive, approachable layer of a guidance counselor in their day-to-day lives.

Clearly, my middle-school questions weren't life-threatening, but to my 12 and 13-year-old self-confidence, navigating that social-emotional minefield was a journey fraught with risk of ruining a day, a week, a semester, a reputation, a psyche.

In the 1980's, my guidance counselor lent unconditional support, yet I think today's middle school students need more support than ever.

Imagine being 12, juggling smartphones, Instagram, and Body Mass Index testing. Imagine opening the paper or (more likely) reading a column online about another mass shooting while gulping down a bowl of cereal.

To be sure, there are those who will argue that my generation coddles kids and that we need to let them build their own resolve and self-confidence -- and I couldn't agree more. But these days, when students have questions that might not fit neatly into boxes marked "academics" or "emotional emergencies", to whom do they turn?

For those students fortunate/confident/willing enough to connect with a trusted teacher or administrator, life is certainly good. Other students might reach out to social workers or psychologists with ease -- or at the very least, receive the encouragement of a parent or staff member. But for the students like my younger self -- tiptoeing through the "What if's" and the "I'm just not sure's" -- every question feels like a gamble. A risk. A chance to blow the whole world apart.

And although we've come a long way in our identification and demystification of social-emotional struggles, there's still a stigma -- felt by many middle school kids -- about being seen with the school's social worker/psychologist.

After <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/2015/08/evanstons-whole-foods-owes-ashley-usher-coleman-apology-retraction-after-shoplifting-accusations/">writing about Ashley Usher-Coleman's August 5th experience</a> at a <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/greenbayroad">Whole Foods in Evanston, Illinois</a>, I discovered much, much more. This is what I've learned.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1: Can This Ever Heal?
</span></strong>Having participated in the Restorative Justice process, I’ve witnessed firsthand the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">restorative</span> powers gained through 1) rebuilding trust and 2) encouraging healing – for victims, for offenders and for the community.

In America, it's so easy to shame offenders and not deal with what we assume are their excuses. It’s easy to point a finger with rhetorical questions, like:

“<b>How</b> dare you?”
“<b>What</b> were you thinking?”
“<b>Who</b> do you think you are?”
“<b>When</b> did you learn to act this way?”
“<b>Why</b> would you do this when you knew better?”
“<b>Why</b> should I care when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> caused the problem?”

But really, what do all of those questions have in common?
A dirty little five-letter word: SHAME.

So now, do the hard work, and listen. <b>Really listen</b>. And ask yourself why we don’t do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> more often.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examining injustice through understanding</span> is the most powerful tool our society has yet to embrace. Can we be an example of how it's done right? Do we truly #StandWithAshley? Or will we shame an offender into isolation?

Our current system of justice is based on a system of retribution and punitive solutions, but my question to you is: "How's that working out for us?"

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 2: How Did I Not See This Coming?</strong><strong>
</strong></span><strong>First, I owe Whole Foods -- and readers -- a public apology.</strong>
My column prompted boycotts and insults about Whole Foods by readers who shared the column more than 700 times on social media. I’d fueled the firestorm ignited by Usher-Coleman's claims.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.33-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3618" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-02 at 6.25.33 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.33-PM.png" width="327" height="60" /></a>

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.25-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3619" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-02 at 6.25.25 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.25-PM.png" width="504" height="134" /></a>

Initially, I was relieved by the swift and supportive response. And I felt I’d more than covered my journalistic bases: Despite an online petition circulating and her story forwarded by multiple trusted sources within our community, we’d corresponded directly, numerous times.

Another thing: Whole Foods’ silence only reinforced my belief in her story. Apparently, others agreed.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.05-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3620" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-02 at 6.25.05 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.05-PM.png" width="494" height="97" /></a>

Yet it was just after my column went live that significant doubts emerged.

After Usher-Coleman read my column, she messaged me to expand on a fact that she, surprisingly, never mentioned in her 2108-word online description of the event.

<b>“</b>Just to clarify,” she wrote, “the vitamins were accidentally dropped into my large carry all after I removed everything looking for my ChapStick. When I was putting everything [back] in, I inadvertently stuck those in as well. This according to the security guard because I actually have no recollection of doing so.”

<i>Uh…no wonder they suspected retail theft</i>, I thought. <i>Why hadn't she mentioned this earlier? </i>

“How,” I wrote back, “did [security] know they were in there?”

“He said that he started watching me when I picked up a market basket,” she wrote. “So, from the beginning.”

Truth is, I felt guilty for feeling suspicious. I didn’t want to be like the security guard she’d described -- suspecting guilt for no valid reason. She <i>must</i> have been targeted. Right?

<b>“</b>Did anyone else hear him say this to you?” I wrote. “Why would he feel the need to do that?”

No response.

I wrote, “I'll clarify these points in the post right now. Thank you for letting me know.”

But then she wrote:<b> “</b>I cannot remember if it's part of the police report, so [I'd] hold off on that detail for now.”

<b>“</b>Can you snap a pic of the police report and send to me?” I replied. “I can't clarify the details without understanding why [security would have] approached you in the first place. Did he approach you inside the store? When did the guard approach/stop you and how did he alert you to the ‘problem’? Did he give you a chance to pay?”

<b>“</b>After I paid for my groceries,” she wrote. “And no, he did not offer me a chance to pay.”

Shortly thereafter, her Facebook page disappeared. Our dialogue, it seems, was over.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3: Am I Invested In Understanding My Role?
</span></strong>On Friday, August 28<sup>th</sup> as I drafted an update highlighting my questions and concerns, an official from the City of Evanston called, requesting anonymity. After reviewing surveillance video from the August 5<sup>th</sup> incident, the facts, I was told, were indisputable.

“This was retail theft, caught clearly on video,” the source said. “Egregious and intentional.”

It was my turn to go silent. I was totally pissed, mostly with myself.

“Can I see a copy of the surveillance video?” I asked the official. “The last thing I can do is write anything more without verifying. ”

I hung up. I was furious. I thought, <em>Are you flipping kidding me? I believed her. I went to BAT for her. I’d specifically and directly asked her how the bottle ended up in her purse. Had she made it all up?</em>

Then I asked myself: <i>What do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> actions suggest about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>? Why hadn’t <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> waited for Whole Foods’ response for a statement? Why hadn’t </i><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> somehow confirmed her statement before sharing it on social media? How could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> be so naïve?</em>

The video had already been turned over to the Evanston Police Department, so all I could do now was what I should have done before I hit publish: Keep bugging someone at Whole Foods for their side of the story.

Not surprisingly, Whole Foods Marketing Director Keith Stewart seemed more than ready to take my call.

“We haven’t made a statement,” he explained, “because it’s our policy not to damage someone’s personal reputation.”

<i>Of course they don’t,</i> I told myself. <i>They leave <b>that</b> dirty work for the untrained, new-media journalists like me, who can write anything we want and hit publish faster than you can say bundle-me-Xfinity.</i>

And though Stewart wouldn’t comment on Whole Foods’ shoplifting policy, he said, “We’re very familiar with the signs of retail theft, like nervous behavior, looking around, intentional concealment. Accidental things happen all the time, but there’s a big difference between that and retail theft.”

Then I blurted out:

“You know, I was working on a post today about my reservations.”
“It struck me as odd when she modified some details after the column gained traction.”
“I’m still processing all of this.”
“I want to make this right.”
“I can’t begin to tell you how hacked off I am right now.”

How, I wondered, did pre-Internet journalists manage to W…A…I…T until they got a statement from someone? Hadn’t I gone the extra mile getting the victim’s statements in writing? But what I’d really done was share half a story – and possibly not even the truth.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 4: What Am I Doing To Help Make Things Right?
</strong></span>“Is it possible to get a copy of the video?” I asked Keith Stewart.

“It’s in the City’s hands now,” Stewart told me. “You’d have to ask them for a copy.”

It was now Friday, August 28<sup>th</sup>, just before 5:00 p.m. Rather than head to the Civic Center and risk arriving too late, I drove straight to the Police Department to fill out a Freedom Of Information Act (<a href="http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#thefoia">FOIA</a>) request.

“Sorry, but no dice,” I was told. I’d have to file the request with the City Clerk on Monday. Figures. Besides, I needed a lesson in patience.

Monday, September 1st really wasn’t a great day to bug Evanston Police Commander Joseph Dugan: He was busy with a homicide investigation following an early morning shooting in the 1800 block of Dodge Avenue. After leaving him a message, I forgot my worries of career suicide and imagined those two young men, shot near our public high school – particularly the one who did not make it. Then I sat in my car and cried.

Later, just before 3:00 p.m., Cmdr. Dugan called. “I’ve got some time now to watch the surveillance video.”

“I’ll be right there,” I said, driving the six blocks instead of walking.

We made small talk walking through several offices, searching for a computer to read the DVD. I realized, in my haste, that I’d forgotten my glasses.

Then, as the video loads, I wonder how and why I am even here.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 5 : Am I Certain I Know The Truth?
</strong></span>I pull out my printout of Usher-Coleman's exact description of her oversight, just so I am clear. Here, again, is what she wrote:

“the vitamins were accidentally dropped into my large carry all after I removed everything looking for my ChapStick. When I was putting everything [back] in, I inadvertently stuck those in as well. This according to the security guard because I actually have no recollection of doing so.”

And here is what I saw on the video, multiple times, alongside Cmdr. Dugan:

She looks around several times. Takes the bottle off the shelf. Takes a small bag out of her larger one. Places the bottle inside the smaller one, secures it shut, and places it into the larger bag.

We watch it again, just to make sure. And we are sure. There is no doubt.

Then, at the checkout, as she unloads items from her basket onto the conveyor belt, she takes a reusable Whole Foods bag from the sales rack and adds it to her pile. As the clerk scans items, she steps away, then returns with what appears to be a loaf of bread. She places it on the belt and removes the unscanned reusable bag, stepping toward the already-scanned pile, holding the unpaid bag just below the counter. She then raises the reusable bag, puts it onto the side of the belt with the scanned items, and loads those items into its opening.

Later, driving with one of my kids, the lyrics of song, played hundreds of times before, sound hauntingly brand-new:

Check your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips […]
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
--From Vampire Weekend's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdwnG5abeg">Oxford Comma</a>

“I really hoped the video proved nothing,” I'd said to Cmdr. Dugan earlier as I left the police station. And I truly did.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 6: Am I Responding To (or With) Actions Or Strategies That Endure?
</strong></span>Regardless of truth or fabrication, however, this story struck such a deep nerve because <b>racial profiling</b> and <b>racial favoritism</b> are so unrelentingly real, so widespread and so absolutely wrong. When we were told about a clear case of it happening in our grocery store over something as benign as oversight? The absurdity unleashed a reaction I can hardly explain. I wanted to shake that security guard and make the racism stop – and – my God! Look! Here, before us were what felt like <b>multiple</b>, <b>tangible</b> ways to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make</span> it stop, by…

•Making an example of the store on social media.
•Standing with neighbors and boycotting the store.
•Signing and sharing a petition online demanding justice.
•Reaching out to the victim directly, offering support.

Anything, everything seemed entirely possible, right? Those were all the EASY solutions. But did they address the issues of racial profiling and racial favoritism in a lasting way, or were they simply temporary forms of punishment/retribution/shame (towards Whole Foods) and support (for Usher-Coleman)?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 7: What Can Be Learned?
</strong></span>Through all of this, there's an obvious lesson about social media: Regardless of intent, every post has a life of its own. Who'd ever imagine a personal Facebook post dissected and shared in a platform like this? As it happens, we all should. As Usher-Coleman wrote in the comments section of the Patch.com article: "...as for my FB post, it was intended for my friends as a way to feel support. I had no idea that it would become what it has..." and "...I didn't ask for people to start a petition, for people to write news articles, for people to picket." But we all, in fact, did, because of her post.

I think it's a mistake to dismiss Ashley Usher-Coleman entirely. I believe racial profiling has happened to her and to others -- and that it will continue to occur if we don't all address the problem. Did it happen at the Whole Foods in Evanston? I'm not the judge, and my trust is clearly shaken -- but it's worth rebuilding, because we need to move forward, not back.

But the most important lesson, I believe, is maintaining compassion. I don’t know what compels an individual to steal, misrepresent, or omit critical details, but she has her reasons, right or wrong; and until I know the individual’s feelings, I cannot fully understand what motivates the actions.

And while I don’t condone stealing, misrepresentation or omission of critical details, my intent was and is to always help someone (and yet note how THAT intention ended up backfiring). Legalities aside, my heart remains open as I offer compassion, because in the future -- even now -- I can only hope others respond similarly towards me.

Is there an opportunity for our community to #StandWithAshley? To organize a Restorative Justice event to bring Whole Foods and the community together with Ashley and make things better? To demonstrate support for Whole Foods? Have we asked ourselves the tough questions:

1. <strong>Can This Ever Heal?</strong>
2. <strong>How Did I Not See This Coming?</strong>
3. <strong>Am I Invested In Understanding My Role?</strong>
4. <strong>What Am I Doing To Help Make Things Right?</strong>
5. <strong>Am I Certain I Know The Truth?</strong>
6. <strong>Am I Responding To (or With) Actions Or Strategies That Endure?</strong>
7. <strong>What Can Be Learned?</strong>

I'll say it again: I'm sorry I didn't dig deeper and get more perspective before I ran <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/2015/08/evanstons-whole-foods-owes-ashley-usher-coleman-apology-retraction-after-shoplifting-accusations/">my first column</a>, but I'm certain I will in the future. I'll continue to write and continue to learn. And I'll #StandWithAshley, because she -- and we -- are all part of a community.

After <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/2015/08/evanstons-whole-foods-owes-ashley-usher-coleman-apology-retraction-after-shoplifting-accusations/">writing about Ashley Usher-Coleman's August 5th experience</a> at a <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/greenbayroad">Whole Foods in Evanston, Illinois</a>, I discovered much, much more. This is what I've learned.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1: Can This Ever Heal?
</span></strong>Having participated in the Restorative Justice process, I’ve witnessed firsthand the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">restorative</span> powers gained through 1) rebuilding trust and 2) encouraging healing – for victims, for offenders and for the community.

In America, it's so easy to shame offenders and not deal with what we assume are their excuses. It’s easy to point a finger with rhetorical questions, like:

“<b>How</b> dare you?”
“<b>What</b> were you thinking?”
“<b>Who</b> do you think you are?”
“<b>When</b> did you learn to act this way?”
“<b>Why</b> would you do this when you knew better?”
“<b>Why</b> should I care when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> caused the problem?”

But really, what do all of those questions have in common?
A dirty little five-letter word: SHAME.

So now, do the hard work, and listen. <b>Really listen</b>. And ask yourself why we don’t do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> more often.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Examining injustice through understanding</span> is the most powerful tool our society has yet to embrace. Can we be an example of how it's done right? Do we truly #StandWithAshley? Or will we shame an offender into isolation?

Our current system of justice is based on a system of retribution and punitive solutions, but my question to you is: "How's that working out for us?"

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 2: How Did I Not See This Coming?</strong><strong>
</strong></span><strong>First, I owe Whole Foods -- and readers -- a public apology.</strong>
My column prompted boycotts and insults about Whole Foods by readers who shared the column more than 700 times on social media. I’d fueled the firestorm ignited by Usher-Coleman's claims.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.33-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3618" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-02 at 6.25.33 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.33-PM.png" width="327" height="60" /></a>

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.25-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3619" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-02 at 6.25.25 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.25-PM.png" width="504" height="134" /></a>

Initially, I was relieved by the swift and supportive response. And I felt I’d more than covered my journalistic bases: Despite an online petition circulating and her story forwarded by multiple trusted sources within our community, we’d corresponded directly, numerous times.

Another thing: Whole Foods’ silence only reinforced my belief in her story. Apparently, others agreed.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.05-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3620" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-02 at 6.25.05 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/files/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-02-at-6.25.05-PM.png" width="494" height="97" /></a>

Yet it was just after my column went live that significant doubts emerged.

After Usher-Coleman read my column, she messaged me to expand on a fact that she, surprisingly, never mentioned in her 2108-word online description of the event.

<b>“</b>Just to clarify,” she wrote, “the vitamins were accidentally dropped into my large carry all after I removed everything looking for my ChapStick. When I was putting everything [back] in, I inadvertently stuck those in as well. This according to the security guard because I actually have no recollection of doing so.”

<i>Uh…no wonder they suspected retail theft</i>, I thought. <i>Why hadn't she mentioned this earlier? </i>

“How,” I wrote back, “did [security] know they were in there?”

“He said that he started watching me when I picked up a market basket,” she wrote. “So, from the beginning.”

Truth is, I felt guilty for feeling suspicious. I didn’t want to be like the security guard she’d described -- suspecting guilt for no valid reason. She <i>must</i> have been targeted. Right?

<b>“</b>Did anyone else hear him say this to you?” I wrote. “Why would he feel the need to do that?”

No response.

I wrote, “I'll clarify these points in the post right now. Thank you for letting me know.”

But then she wrote:<b> “</b>I cannot remember if it's part of the police report, so [I'd] hold off on that detail for now.”

<b>“</b>Can you snap a pic of the police report and send to me?” I replied. “I can't clarify the details without understanding why [security would have] approached you in the first place. Did he approach you inside the store? When did the guard approach/stop you and how did he alert you to the ‘problem’? Did he give you a chance to pay?”

<b>“</b>After I paid for my groceries,” she wrote. “And no, he did not offer me a chance to pay.”

Shortly thereafter, her Facebook page disappeared. Our dialogue, it seems, was over.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 3: Am I Invested In Understanding My Role?
</span></strong>On Friday, August 28<sup>th</sup> as I drafted an update highlighting my questions and concerns, an official from the City of Evanston called, requesting anonymity. After reviewing surveillance video from the August 5<sup>th</sup> incident, the facts, I was told, were indisputable.

“This was retail theft, caught clearly on video,” the source said. “Egregious and intentional.”

It was my turn to go silent. I was totally pissed, mostly with myself.

“Can I see a copy of the surveillance video?” I asked the official. “The last thing I can do is write anything more without verifying. ”

I hung up. I was furious. I thought, <em>Are you flipping kidding me? I believed her. I went to BAT for her. I’d specifically and directly asked her how the bottle ended up in her purse. Had she made it all up?</em>

Then I asked myself: <i>What do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> actions suggest about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>? Why hadn’t <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> waited for Whole Foods’ response for a statement? Why hadn’t </i><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> somehow confirmed her statement before sharing it on social media? How could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> be so naïve?</em>

The video had already been turned over to the Evanston Police Department, so all I could do now was what I should have done before I hit publish: Keep bugging someone at Whole Foods for their side of the story.

Not surprisingly, Whole Foods Marketing Director Keith Stewart seemed more than ready to take my call.

“We haven’t made a statement,” he explained, “because it’s our policy not to damage someone’s personal reputation.”

<i>Of course they don’t,</i> I told myself. <i>They leave <b>that</b> dirty work for the untrained, new-media journalists like me, who can write anything we want and hit publish faster than you can say bundle-me-Xfinity.</i>

And though Stewart wouldn’t comment on Whole Foods’ shoplifting policy, he said, “We’re very familiar with the signs of retail theft, like nervous behavior, looking around, intentional concealment. Accidental things happen all the time, but there’s a big difference between that and retail theft.”

Then I blurted out:

“You know, I was working on a post today about my reservations.”
“It struck me as odd when she modified some details after the column gained traction.”
“I’m still processing all of this.”
“I want to make this right.”
“I can’t begin to tell you how hacked off I am right now.”

How, I wondered, did pre-Internet journalists manage to W…A…I…T until they got a statement from someone? Hadn’t I gone the extra mile getting the victim’s statements in writing? But what I’d really done was share half a story – and possibly not even the truth.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 4: What Am I Doing To Help Make Things Right?
</strong></span>“Is it possible to get a copy of the video?” I asked Keith Stewart.

“It’s in the City’s hands now,” Stewart told me. “You’d have to ask them for a copy.”

It was now Friday, August 28<sup>th</sup>, just before 5:00 p.m. Rather than head to the Civic Center and risk arriving too late, I drove straight to the Police Department to fill out a Freedom Of Information Act (<a href="http://www.foia.gov/faq.html#thefoia">FOIA</a>) request.

“Sorry, but no dice,” I was told. I’d have to file the request with the City Clerk on Monday. Figures. Besides, I needed a lesson in patience.

Monday, September 1st really wasn’t a great day to bug Evanston Police Commander Joseph Dugan: He was busy with a homicide investigation following an early morning shooting in the 1800 block of Dodge Avenue. After leaving him a message, I forgot my worries of career suicide and imagined those two young men, shot near our public high school – particularly the one who did not make it. Then I sat in my car and cried.

Later, just before 3:00 p.m., Cmdr. Dugan called. “I’ve got some time now to watch the surveillance video.”

“I’ll be right there,” I said, driving the six blocks instead of walking.

We made small talk walking through several offices, searching for a computer to read the DVD. I realized, in my haste, that I’d forgotten my glasses.

Then, as the video loads, I wonder how and why I am even here.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 5 : Am I Certain I Know The Truth?
</strong></span>I pull out my printout of Usher-Coleman's exact description of her oversight, just so I am clear. Here, again, is what she wrote:

“the vitamins were accidentally dropped into my large carry all after I removed everything looking for my ChapStick. When I was putting everything [back] in, I inadvertently stuck those in as well. This according to the security guard because I actually have no recollection of doing so.”

And here is what I saw on the video, multiple times, alongside Cmdr. Dugan:

She looks around several times. Takes the bottle off the shelf. Takes a small bag out of her larger one. Places the bottle inside the smaller one, secures it shut, and places it into the larger bag.

We watch it again, just to make sure. And we are sure. There is no doubt.

Then, at the checkout, as she unloads items from her basket onto the conveyor belt, she takes a reusable Whole Foods bag from the sales rack and adds it to her pile. As the clerk scans items, she steps away, then returns with what appears to be a loaf of bread. She places it on the belt and removes the unscanned reusable bag, stepping toward the already-scanned pile, holding the unpaid bag just below the counter. She then raises the reusable bag, puts it onto the side of the belt with the scanned items, and loads those items into its opening.

Later, driving with one of my kids, the lyrics of song, played hundreds of times before, sound hauntingly brand-new:

Check your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips […]
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
--From Vampire Weekend's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdwnG5abeg">Oxford Comma</a>

“I really hoped the video proved nothing,” I'd said to Cmdr. Dugan earlier as I left the police station. And I truly did.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 6: Am I Responding To (or With) Actions Or Strategies That Endure?
</strong></span>Regardless of truth or fabrication, however, this story struck such a deep nerve because <b>racial profiling</b> and <b>racial favoritism</b> are so unrelentingly real, so widespread and so absolutely wrong. When we were told about a clear case of it happening in our grocery store over something as benign as oversight? The absurdity unleashed a reaction I can hardly explain. I wanted to shake that security guard and make the racism stop – and – my God! Look! Here, before us were what felt like <b>multiple</b>, <b>tangible</b> ways to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make</span> it stop, by…

•Making an example of the store on social media.
•Standing with neighbors and boycotting the store.
•Signing and sharing a petition online demanding justice.
•Reaching out to the victim directly, offering support.

Anything, everything seemed entirely possible, right? Those were all the EASY solutions. But did they address the issues of racial profiling and racial favoritism in a lasting way, or were they simply temporary forms of punishment/retribution/shame (towards Whole Foods) and support (for Usher-Coleman)?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 7: What Can Be Learned?
</strong></span>Through all of this, there's an obvious lesson about social media: Regardless of intent, every post has a life of its own. Who'd ever imagine a personal Facebook post dissected and shared in a platform like this? As it happens, we all should. As Usher-Coleman wrote in the comments section of the Patch.com article: "...as for my FB post, it was intended for my friends as a way to feel support. I had no idea that it would become what it has..." and "...I didn't ask for people to start a petition, for people to write news articles, for people to picket." But we all, in fact, did, because of her post.

I think it's a mistake to dismiss Ashley Usher-Coleman entirely. I believe racial profiling has happened to her and to others -- and that it will continue to occur if we don't all address the problem. Did it happen at the Whole Foods in Evanston? I'm not the judge, and my trust is clearly shaken -- but it's worth rebuilding, because we need to move forward, not back.

But the most important lesson, I believe, is maintaining compassion. I don’t know what compels an individual to steal, misrepresent, or omit critical details, but she has her reasons, right or wrong; and until I know the individual’s feelings, I cannot fully understand what motivates the actions.

And while I don’t condone stealing, misrepresentation or omission of critical details, my intent was and is to always help someone (and yet note how THAT intention ended up backfiring). Legalities aside, my heart remains open as I offer compassion, because in the future -- even now -- I can only hope others respond similarly towards me.

Is there an opportunity for our community to #StandWithAshley? To organize a Restorative Justice event to bring Whole Foods and the community together with Ashley and make things better? To demonstrate support for Whole Foods? Have we asked ourselves the tough questions:

1. <strong>Can This Ever Heal?</strong>
2. <strong>How Did I Not See This Coming?</strong>
3. <strong>Am I Invested In Understanding My Role?</strong>
4. <strong>What Am I Doing To Help Make Things Right?</strong>
5. <strong>Am I Certain I Know The Truth?</strong>
6. <strong>Am I Responding To (or With) Actions Or Strategies That Endure?</strong>
7. <strong>What Can Be Learned?</strong>

I'll say it again: I'm sorry I didn't dig deeper and get more perspective before I ran <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/2015/08/evanstons-whole-foods-owes-ashley-usher-coleman-apology-retraction-after-shoplifting-accusations/">my first column</a>, but I'm certain I will in the future. I'll continue to write and continue to learn. And I'll #StandWithAshley, because she -- and we -- are all part of a community.

Lately, I've been doing it all the time and it's made me cranky.

Therefore, here's a post written completely from the heart -- I'm FORCING myself NOT to use the delete key. Just try it, Weisenheimer. It's not as easy as it seems.

So, WHY do I always hit delete? Is it because I want my words to be perfect?

Yes.

Is it because I want you to love what you read?

Yes.

Is it because I overwrite and need to condense?

God yes (and I'll confess...I initially wrote "Yes", then backspaced, added "God" and changed the capital "Y" to a lowercase "y". NOW do you see why I'm cranky? This time, I'm REALLY done using the delete key) .

Thing is, I can't cure cancer and I can't stop time and I sure as hell can't make anything perfect or please everyone or stop being who I am. All I can do is write in my most authentic voice, But, for what feels like a very long time, I haven't been writing that way. I've been trying to be someone I'm not. Actually, I've been trying to be too many things to too many people and constantly falling short. Story of my life, actually, but that's not the point.

What IS the point is that I started this writing career seven years ago hoping to write a novel.

I DID that. I wrote it and I was proud (SO proud) and it was a fine manuscript. Not sucky...but definitely not publishable (BTW, is that even a word? If not, it is now. You're welcome). At least, it wasn't publishable in the "traditional" sense. I suppose I could have self-published it but I didn't (again, you're welcome!). I knew my novel needed help, but I didn't know what that help looked like. I was stuck.

And so, I did what I do best: I AVOIDED REVISIONS.

<em>I'm letting the manuscript marinate</em>, I told myself.

So while those flavors developed, I distracted myself with anything that felt like true, creative passion. You've heard the term "starving artist", right? Well, I was hungry for creative energy, and when I couldn't find my way through my novel's problems, I became a "fixer" of sorts, anywhere I could. When one of my kids struggled with school -- I was ON IT! When one of the town's local cultural centers neared foreclosure -- I tried to SAVE IT! Time after time, I said "I'll DO IT!" rather than asking myself, "What do my characters need? What does my story need?" The idea of hitting the delete key on all the work I'd done was nauseating. Horrifying.

I'd lived and breathed these characters for several years, but after 8 rejections from ridiculously successful editors, the writing, it seems, was on the wall: <em>Go back. It's not working. </em>

I felt trapped.

<em>Do I make the changes some of them suggest? Do I agree with those changes? If I do make the revisions, does everything else in the novel still ring true? Am I staying true to my characters? To my story? To my plot?</em>

<em>Do I even HAVE a plot?</em>

And that's when it hit me.

I'd never plotted out my novel.

I'd gone from the gut, sketching out my characters as they came to me, as they presented themselves.

Oh, God, not in a creepy, "Hi, nice to meet you. I'd like you to write about me" sort of way, but in a <em>Wow, I fell asleep thinking about my character again last night and she seems more and more real every time I picture her</em> sort of way.

I wrote pages and pages of notes about my characters, my settings, my scenes...and then I strung them all together in a way that FELT right and true. I let the characters guide me. I'm not making this up. It wasn't some OUIJA board thing, like them telling me to open the <em>D-O-O-R</em> when the lady in <em>B-L-A-C-K</em> beckons. It was more like, <em>My characters are telling me there's a moment here with a vacancy best filled with tenderness; who's going to do it? Anyone? Anyone?</em>

My "process" (Snort! Like I actually have one?) carried me through to the end of, what Anne Lamott refers to as a "shitty first draft". Problem is, I was preparing for my Oprah spotlight as I typed "THE END". I couldn't see the shit through all those layers of mascara I'd applied for a close-up that never materialized.What I DID experience was an abrasive "makeup remover" of sorts -- otherwise known as a swift kick in the ass.

Stung by the polite rejections of eight amazing editors and uncertain how to proceed, I dove, head-first, into a swamp of a project in my town involving real estate, local politics, race relations, legal issues and financial wrangling. Let me just say, my mascara ran as fast as my heart as I tried to "fix" a situation I had no business touching. Driven only by a love of community and hope for the future, I wouldn't let go, no matter how many times my husband asked, "Why are you spending so much time on this? Don't you want to focus on your novel? You don't have to keep going..." But I felt like I had to. It didn't feel like a choice.

<em>I can't give up,</em> I told myself. <em>I know this project takes away from my goal of getting published, but I can't give up on this project.</em> I started to wonder if I'd ever get my novel published. <em>If I don't,</em> I told myself, <em> that'll make TWO huge failures. </em>NOW, I was stuck even deeper.

Soon, circumstances around the community project grew toxic. Our team, exhausted from too few people doing too much work defending what we'd worked so hard to build, disintegrated as others finally (and not so ethically) expressed interest in the project. Attempts to collaborate with the other groups failed, forcing our group to walk away.

"That's TWO," I told myself. "First the novel...now this."

It took me several months to lose my sadness, but as I'd catch flickers of light within the building we tried to save, I realized I wasn't meant to manage its CPR.

I don't regret the experience now (though if you'd asked me then, I'd have punched you in the face and told you to go to hell). I'd been determined to "fix" things for that little building, but what I couldn't see was that a "successful fix" only happens when the time is right, when the right characters are in place, and when there's an authentic story to tell; otherwise, it's just a quick fix. To be honest, I'm still not convinced the stars are aligned on the project, but I gave it my all and I'm hoping for the best. And as my husband reminded me (as my mascara ran down my cheeks), "Sometimes a leader's job is actually knowing when to step away."

And so I did. It was tough and I felt like I was neglecting it and failing. But I came to see that it was all part of the process.

I've gone back to my novel, finally. It took a fairy godmother of sorts to get me back there, but I was almost ready and she gave me the push I needed. I've overhauled the entire manuscript and am starting it from scratch. My fairy godmother encourages me to say, "You're not starting over. That was your 'Discovery Draft', and now you're writing the novel as it was meant to be written.'" And I KNOW she's right.

Patience. It seems to elude me wherever I go.

Sometimes wish I'd  seen how necessary it was putting my novel in that metaphorical drawer, just living life...not looking back. Then again, I just couldn't let go of my characters or my story. A friend in my critique group once said, "The difference between a writer and and a published author is that the author never gave up."

And so, for all the regret I've carried about my novel taking so long to get published, I realize it's taking as long as it must take. I've had some things to do along the way that inform me as a writer, a community member, a mother, a friend. While learning certainly happens when we look around and listen, it also happens when we look back.

Therefore, I give myself permission to look back whenever I need to, asking whether it's worth holding on to something from my past.

And I also vow, moving forward, not to hit delete so much. This moment, right now, is not the time to second guess everything in our hearts and souls. If we're lucky, there'll be plenty of time for that silly business later.

Lately, I've been doing it all the time and it's made me cranky.

Therefore, here's a post written completely from the heart -- I'm FORCING myself NOT to use the delete key. Just try it, Weisenheimer. It's not as easy as it seems.

So, WHY do I always hit delete? Is it because I want my words to be perfect?

Yes.

Is it because I want you to love what you read?

Yes.

Is it because I overwrite and need to condense?

God yes (and I'll confess...I initially wrote "Yes", then backspaced, added "God" and changed the capital "Y" to a lowercase "y". NOW do you see why I'm cranky? This time, I'm REALLY done using the delete key) .

Thing is, I can't cure cancer and I can't stop time and I sure as hell can't make anything perfect or please everyone or stop being who I am. All I can do is write in my most authentic voice, But, for what feels like a very long time, I haven't been writing that way. I've been trying to be someone I'm not. Actually, I've been trying to be too many things to too many people and constantly falling short. Story of my life, actually, but that's not the point.

What IS the point is that I started this writing career seven years ago hoping to write a novel.

I DID that. I wrote it and I was proud (SO proud) and it was a fine manuscript. Not sucky...but definitely not publishable (BTW, is that even a word? If not, it is now. You're welcome). At least, it wasn't publishable in the "traditional" sense. I suppose I could have self-published it but I didn't (again, you're welcome!). I knew my novel needed help, but I didn't know what that help looked like. I was stuck.

And so, I did what I do best: I AVOIDED REVISIONS.

<em>I'm letting the manuscript marinate</em>, I told myself.

So while those flavors developed, I distracted myself with anything that felt like true, creative passion. You've heard the term "starving artist", right? Well, I was hungry for creative energy, and when I couldn't find my way through my novel's problems, I became a "fixer" of sorts, anywhere I could. When one of my kids struggled with school -- I was ON IT! When one of the town's local cultural centers neared foreclosure -- I tried to SAVE IT! Time after time, I said "I'll DO IT!" rather than asking myself, "What do my characters need? What does my story need?" The idea of hitting the delete key on all the work I'd done was nauseating. Horrifying.

I'd lived and breathed these characters for several years, but after 8 rejections from ridiculously successful editors, the writing, it seems, was on the wall: <em>Go back. It's not working. </em>

I felt trapped.

<em>Do I make the changes some of them suggest? Do I agree with those changes? If I do make the revisions, does everything else in the novel still ring true? Am I staying true to my characters? To my story? To my plot?</em>

<em>Do I even HAVE a plot?</em>

And that's when it hit me.

I'd never plotted out my novel.

I'd gone from the gut, sketching out my characters as they came to me, as they presented themselves.

Oh, God, not in a creepy, "Hi, nice to meet you. I'd like you to write about me" sort of way, but in a <em>Wow, I fell asleep thinking about my character again last night and she seems more and more real every time I picture her</em> sort of way.

I wrote pages and pages of notes about my characters, my settings, my scenes...and then I strung them all together in a way that FELT right and true. I let the characters guide me. I'm not making this up. It wasn't some OUIJA board thing, like them telling me to open the <em>D-O-O-R</em> when the lady in <em>B-L-A-C-K</em> beckons. It was more like, <em>My characters are telling me there's a moment here with a vacancy best filled with tenderness; who's going to do it? Anyone? Anyone?</em>

My "process" (Snort! Like I actually have one?) carried me through to the end of, what Anne Lamott refers to as a "shitty first draft". Problem is, I was preparing for my Oprah spotlight as I typed "THE END". I couldn't see the shit through all those layers of mascara I'd applied for a close-up that never materialized.What I DID experience was an abrasive "makeup remover" of sorts -- otherwise known as a swift kick in the ass.

Stung by the polite rejections of eight amazing editors and uncertain how to proceed, I dove, head-first, into a swamp of a project in my town involving real estate, local politics, race relations, legal issues and financial wrangling. Let me just say, my mascara ran as fast as my heart as I tried to "fix" a situation I had no business touching. Driven only by a love of community and hope for the future, I wouldn't let go, no matter how many times my husband asked, "Why are you spending so much time on this? Don't you want to focus on your novel? You don't have to keep going..." But I felt like I had to. It didn't feel like a choice.

<em>I can't give up,</em> I told myself. <em>I know this project takes away from my goal of getting published, but I can't give up on this project.</em> I started to wonder if I'd ever get my novel published. <em>If I don't,</em> I told myself, <em> that'll make TWO huge failures. </em>NOW, I was stuck even deeper.

Soon, circumstances around the community project grew toxic. Our team, exhausted from too few people doing too much work defending what we'd worked so hard to build, disintegrated as others finally (and not so ethically) expressed interest in the project. Attempts to collaborate with the other groups failed, forcing our group to walk away.

"That's TWO," I told myself. "First the novel...now this."

It took me several months to lose my sadness, but as I'd catch flickers of light within the building we tried to save, I realized I wasn't meant to manage its CPR.

I don't regret the experience now (though if you'd asked me then, I'd have punched you in the face and told you to go to hell). I'd been determined to "fix" things for that little building, but what I couldn't see was that a "successful fix" only happens when the time is right, when the right characters are in place, and when there's an authentic story to tell; otherwise, it's just a quick fix. To be honest, I'm still not convinced the stars are aligned on the project, but I gave it my all and I'm hoping for the best. And as my husband reminded me (as my mascara ran down my cheeks), "Sometimes a leader's job is actually knowing when to step away."

And so I did. It was tough and I felt like I was neglecting it and failing. But I came to see that it was all part of the process.

I've gone back to my novel, finally. It took a fairy godmother of sorts to get me back there, but I was almost ready and she gave me the push I needed. I've overhauled the entire manuscript and am starting it from scratch. My fairy godmother encourages me to say, "You're not starting over. That was your 'Discovery Draft', and now you're writing the novel as it was meant to be written.'" And I KNOW she's right.

Patience. It seems to elude me wherever I go.

Sometimes wish I'd  seen how necessary it was putting my novel in that metaphorical drawer, just living life...not looking back. Then again, I just couldn't let go of my characters or my story. A friend in my critique group once said, "The difference between a writer and and a published author is that the author never gave up."

And so, for all the regret I've carried about my novel taking so long to get published, I realize it's taking as long as it must take. I've had some things to do along the way that inform me as a writer, a community member, a mother, a friend. While learning certainly happens when we look around and listen, it also happens when we look back.

Therefore, I give myself permission to look back whenever I need to, asking whether it's worth holding on to something from my past.

And I also vow, moving forward, not to hit delete so much. This moment, right now, is not the time to second guess everything in our hearts and souls. If we're lucky, there'll be plenty of time for that silly business later.

Sure, the other stuff's important:

Make sure they get lots of sleep and plenty of protein.
Get to know the teacher, the classmates, the classmates' parents, the school social worker.
Volunteer in the classroom.
Smile at drop off when you say goodbye (even when they're crying).
Arrive on the playground with another smile and a beverage (since drinking fountain lines are just too long).
Expect to hear few details until bedtime, when anxiety about tomorrow summons the worst memories of today.

But while you know these things -- and many others --  what you need personally is a magic salve to soothe the sharp, tiny fissure etched on the surface of your heart, the first, most painful symptom of separation heartbreak.

You will survive, though, even when it gets worse, because it will get better, I promise. I've been there.

This year, I'll have a 7th grader, a sophomore and a senior in high school, but ask me about each of their first days of kindergarten and I'll tell you the specific waves of emotion at each goodbye:

<strong>Shock</strong>: How did time pass so quickly since the day you were born?

<strong>Worry</strong>: Will this teacher protect you?

<strong>Joy</strong>: I actually have time to put life and work back in order!

<strong>Curiosity</strong>: Which of these classmates will become your friends?

<strong>Worry</strong>: Who's most likely to make your life hell...and where is that parent?

<strong>Concern</strong>: Did I send the right supplies?

<strong>Worry</strong>: Were my emergency numbers legible on the form?

<strong>Annoyance</strong>: The bell already rang. Why won't they just take them inside? I see tears forming.

<strong>Worry</strong>: Did I lock the car? My purse is in there. Let's get the line moving, people.

<strong>Insecurity</strong>: That mom's looking dressed for success.

<strong>Relief</strong>: My child is laughing with the other kids.

<strong>Worry</strong>: The line is moving. This is it. He'll look back this way. Can he see me?

<strong>Indecision</strong>: Where should I move? Should I even move? Will he know I've moved?

<strong>Worry</strong>: If he sees me, will it make things worse?

<strong>Wonder</strong>: That little boy's running back to his mom. How's she going to manage this?

<strong>Worry</strong>: What if mine does it, too?

<strong>Emotional</strong> <strong>exhaustion</strong>: Can we just get this over, now?

<strong>Worry</strong>: Where the hell is my compassion? Am I THAT self-absorbed? Did I lock the car?

<strong>Fear</strong>: Are we out of coffee at home?

<strong>Surprise</strong>: Is it raining? Is that a tear on my cheek?

<strong>Worry</strong>: Will he see me crying? Oh God.

<strong>Embarrassment</strong>: It's <em>kindergarten</em>, for Christ's sake. I'll see him in a few hours.

<strong>Worry</strong>: He just looked around wildly. He's scared. He's scared. It's a huge school. He'll be okay, right? They keep an eye on them at every minute, right?

<strong>Determination</strong>: This is going to be okay...as long as someone makes the call and gets the line moving. Seriously, people.

<strong>Worry</strong>: He's not talking to anyone now. All the other kids are chattering away. His heart must be racing like a hummingbird's.

<strong>Obsession</strong>: The tissues are in my purse... and my nose is overflowing. Can I wipe it with the back of my hand and, if so, which of these moms (aside from Ms. Dressed For Success) would do the same thing and not judge?

And then, just like that, he went in. Two years later, so did another. And three years later, yet another. My kids made it through that first day, and the next and the next and the next and the next. And so did I.

And I've often wondered how I kept moving, even when they were with others...out of my sight, my care, my protection. How did I learn to not only walk away that first day but to, eventually, put them out of my mind for chunks of time? Some might say it's healthy... but I know it's really a matter of letting go.

And that's why it's so hard...at first. Because there's nothing you want more than for them to be strong, independent people, but to let that happen, you have to take that first huge, earth-shattering step, and this is it.

Remember, though, that the tiny, sharp fissure on your heart heals over at the end of each day when you're reunited. Your love grows even stronger. Literally, day-by-day. You don't even notice it while it's happening, but just as your child inches up over the summer, it happens.

It's the magic of separation heartbreak, and it's worth the pain, as long as you remember to breathe deep and go long; otherwise scar tissue forms and hardens your heart. You cannot lose sight that these fissures will keep coming and coming and coming now...and you must remain pliant enough to endure them. Those who harden will shatter from rigidity.

<strong>Breathe Deep So Your Heart Remains Pliant</strong>
Time does not stop -- but you CAN:
Stop when you <em>think</em> you understand --and simply listen.
Inhale gratitude whenever possible, and you'll find it's easier to exhale positivity. Take a 10-minute walk, pour a cup of tea, text a friend or a teacher or a neighbor or a family member and just say "thank you for your kindness toward my child".
Sleep on the toughest situations -- allow yourself space and rest to breathe deep, to consider decisions and actions and conclusions -- rather than reacting immediately.

<strong>Go Long -- This Is a Marathon</strong>
It's overwhelming thinking you're only just beginning. "How can I have these crazy emotions when she's only in KINDERGARTEN! I'll be a wreck when she's in middle school!" Every parent feels this way <del>at one point or another</del> multiple times throughout their child's adolescence, so you're in good company. You're going to hit bumps along the way -- you won't know if you've done the right thing, said the right thing, or made the right choice as a parent -- and these moments in question are all part of the process of raising good kids. Figure out what works and hold on, and forgive yourself for your missteps. And just as every child is different, you will be different with every child. We teach our kids to move on after mistakes -- so walk the walk and do the same for yourself.

Pretty heavy advice for parents of 5-year-olds, right?

But take it from someone who was there just a blink ago: breathing deep and going long will get you and your kids through.
You can do this.

P.S. Just don't leave your tissues in the unlocked car.

Then again, maybe not (and when you're finished reading THIS column, read <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/riding-the-waves/2015/09/not-the-story-you-expected-whole-foods-racial-profiling-restorative-justice/">THIS FOLLOWUP piece</a> for an update on the situation).

For example, a good journalist would never cite Wikipedia as a source, right? After all, there are countless alternative sources available and, if nothing else, Wikipedia's just...oh what's the word I'm looking for...? Ah! Untrustworthy.

And a good grocery store security guard would never presume anything other than blatant theft -- shoplifting -- when a shopper's oversight happens, <em>particularly</em> if she's black. After all, while countless oversights can happen to anyone while grocery shopping, if nothing else, this is a <em>black</em> woman, and she is, of course...oh what's that damn word again?

But let's assume I'm just a plain old mom from Evanston, Illinois, where a <del>first</del> <del>second</del> third Whole Foods recently opened on Green Bay Road -- one that's involved in a social media explosion over its alleged shoplifting charges against a black female business owner, Ashley Usher-Coleman.
<blockquote>From Wikipedia:
"Shoplifting is typically undertaken by amateurs, and involves concealing an item and leaving the store without paying for it. Other forms of shoplifting include swapping price labels of different items, and eating a store's food without paying for it. Commonly shoplifted items are those with a high value in proportion to their size, such as razor blades and cigarettes. Retailers have reported that 0.6% of their inventory is lost to shoplifting. The term shoplifting and shoplifter has not been defined in Law. The word <b>shrinkage</b> is not a synonym for shoplifting, as it includes merchandise loss by means other than shoplifting."</blockquote>
And, with her permission, here is Ashley Usher-Coleman's description of the incident (from Facebook):
<div data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">

<strong>RACISM: ATTACK MY SPIRIT, BREAK MY HEART, BUT I WILL NOT BE WHO YOU WILL ME TO BE. I WILL REMAIN...BECAUSE I MUST.</strong>

<strong>My heart is broken. And try as I might I just cannot make this ache go away. I am typically an extremely private person. I don’t overshare on social media. For every one picture you see, there are fifty that you didn’t. My wedding had 18 attendees. And I can count with my fingers the number of people who truly know the depths and pain of my story. I aim to look forward, to continue to grow. And only look back to gain knowledge or to re-break bones that never healed properly. I try to be slow to anger and eager to listen/hear. Everybody has a story, I believe. Everyone has a reason they are the way they are, some deep part of their soul that is being trampled on. So perhaps, that’s why they judge and project. I can handle it, I say to myself, for I have been through far worse. But I think I’m tired. Courage takes strength. And strength, even the strongest kind, has its limits.</strong>

<strong>Every morning, for eleven years I get up, get dressed, grab a cup of coffee, and before I walk out the door I put on my brave face. I dig out my kind heart. I make sure I have my patience and empathy in my purse. I’m going to need it. Maybe even before I get to work, if I stop at the local coffee shop. I’m heading to Chicago’s Northshore. Or some days Chicago’s ritzier neighborhoods. I’m a veteran to these parts. I’m used to being pulled over because it “looked” like I was going to commit a traffic violation. I’m used to the shock on people’s faces when I comment that their street reminds me of the one I grew up on. I’m ready to answer the questions that arise when people find out that I went to private school. Were you bussed there? Did you earn a scholarship? I’m used to the wondering face when neither of those things turns out to be true. And the perplexed look on their faces as they try to register that a black man could be a business owner and indeed afford to send his daughter to private school all her life. That he came from poverty, but refused to go on government assistance when his parents died. As long as he was able, he would not depend on anyone. Even if that meant eating saltines and vienna sausages, he was going to work hard. He was going to be a business owner. "Ahhh...she’s the exception." Except I’m not. My school was 50% black. Most of my black friends have Master’s degrees and a few more have their Doctorate. The town I grew up in is filled with law abiding, educated, family oriented people contributing to society like everyone else. They are a part of their PTA’s. They run for public office. Plant community garden. Save for their children’s college education. Worry about raising kids who will also contribute to society. Most of this country was built on the backs of our ancestors. Most of our parents (and most definitely grandparents) can remember the Jim Crow south just 50 some odd years ago. When they couldn’t eat at most lunch counters. When they walked and walked and walked to make a way for their children, for us, for me. Most of our families bought homes and land that has been passed down through the generations so that no one in the family ever went without shelter. This though, goes over the head of many people I come across in the Chicagoland area. These things, this “ New Civil RIghts Movement” that has “come up” since Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown is baseless. If you encounter prejudice then you must have done something to arouse suspicion and make people see you that way. After all, these are new times. We have a black president…</strong>

<strong>...I call bullshit. Every day I have shown up for work, in a place where most people consider me a domestic (not that there is anything wrong with that.) Many shocked that I attended college. Fighting preconceived notions about why I do what I do. But I love it. I believe what it says in the Bible about how to treat the children. I believe more than anything that the greatest way I can contribute is by caring for the next generation. Of course, I’ve had my criticism from blacks as well, who wonder why I work in a predominantly white neighborhood. Why I take my talents and give them to well off “white” children. I can imagine that to them my days probably look like a chapter of The Help. That’s okay. I get it. But I’m an Early Childhood Professional. I’m a cuddler, a teacher, a boo-boo kisser, a cheerleader, a tutor, a hand to hold when one needs courage, a reminder to always be yourself, a bear hug when “being yourself” got your picked on at school, a high-five when the next day you had the courage to hold your head up high, a trustworthy mother figure for Littles so their mothers can make a living for them. But more than that I’m a contradiction. I’m a living, breathing example that what you learn about me on TV is not what is real. I am a safe place to ask race related questions that they may have never gotten a chance to ask until they are adults. I’m an educator of my culture and theirs since American is American and we all contributed. And while I have had the honor and privilege to work with some phenomenal families, when I go to the store, or the library, or the coffee shop I am subject to the looks, the questions, the security detail around the store. The being judged off hand for my race and not my character.</strong>

<strong>This is the reason for my heartache. Last week I was arrested. A security guard at the new Whole Foods on Green Bay had me arrested because I asked to speak to a lawyer. After purchasing $80 worth of groceries I inadvertently exited the store without one of my vitamins being paid for. It was an accident, of course. The security guard admitted that it appeared to be one and agreed to let me go with a warning. That is, if I agreed to sign a legal document stating that I was a shoplifter. I said, I would need to call my husband. To this he got extremely confused and agitated. He wanted to know why, and inquired “are you a child?” After informing him that I would need to wait for my lawyer to call back before signing any legal documents he rendered me belligerent, uncooperative, and had me arrested. Not for the vitamins but because he didn’t “feel like” waiting for my attorney to call back. (Though the entire process from start to finish was about 10 minutes.) Its absurd as I’m sure people make this mistake all the time. In fact, I know this to be true because I’ve asked. Most were given the opportunity to pay for said item and move on. Or given an ACTUAL warning (and not coerced into signing some paper) and let go. All of them were white. I know, I played the race card. I didn’t want to but I must since this security guard stated to the police that he had been watching me since I walked in the store. Really? Why? There is nothing spectacular about a women shopping for bread and vitamins. Nothing spectacular except my race. And because of this my name, my character, and 11 years of hard work are being dragged through the mud because I had the audacity to ask to confer with my lawyer first instead of allowing him to bully me into stating I was a criminal. I was handcuffed, searched, finger printed, and left in a cell for hours- which caused me to have a significant panic attack. For those that don’t know I have PTSD symptoms resulting from situations in small rooms very much like the one I was locked away in. And now I am being charged with a misdemeanor. I have never so much as been suspended from school. I have been left in charge of people's million dollar homes, cars, and more importantly their children are left in my care while they work or travel. All returned in the condition (and hopefully) better than they were left to me. For eleven years! I started my own business 5 months ago and haven’t had to spend anything on advertising. Just referrals have gotten me to a place where I have had to stop accepting new clients. And just like, on a whim, it can be taken away.</strong>

<strong>Answer me this, what is the point? Why should blacks who played by the rules, work hard, and contribute to society- why should we care? Why shouldn’t we all give up? Why shouldn’t we just forget it and become the people that the media portray us to be. Why are the Black Lives Matter protesters thugs and criminals when the Ted Bundy’s of the world are patriots? ARMED patriots. Why are our teenagers judged (and sentenced) more harshly than their counterparts regardless of the fact that most crimes they commit are the same and mostly minor. Why was my husband shoved and belittled last summer at Wrigley because we had to audacity to attend a Zac Brown Concert. Why have employers loved me on the phone and then turned me away, before even speaking to me, when I showed up for a second interview. "I’m sorry, we don’t have anything for you at this time." Why have I been pulled over for “looking like” I was going to commit a crime. Why have people's neighbors threatened to call the police on me when I was waiting outside for a friend, drinking coffee and reading the New York Times. And why, after eleven years of hard work in the community where I both serve and live am I followed from the moment I walk into a store? And then treated like a common criminal. I’m heartbroken. I feel as though Chicagoland has broken me. A crack here, a crack there. I feel like the girl who keeps loving someone who doesn’t love her. Who keeps “looking on the bright side” when really she should move on. Perhaps I should. I think of the Littles that I cared for this week. Will they remember that I held them until they were asleep. Will they remember that I helped them learn to read. Will they remember that I cheered loudly for them at their recitals, graduations, and music programs. Will they remember the hugs I gave when someone had broken their spirit? Or the way I held them up for hours because gas pains made them cry. Will they remember the laughs, the cries, the lessons, the adventures, the experiences that we had together. Will they remember THAT me when they see my culture portrayed on the television? Will they believe what people tell them about who I am, who we are, or what their spirits tell them? Or will the media and the nay-sayers win? Will the good in us always be judged by the misactions of a few of us. After it all, will they still grow up to follow someone around a store because of their skin color. I know they won’t. Their parents won’t allow it. But someone's children will. Perhaps I should give in and just be bitter. But I know I won’t. I can’t. It’s not who I am. I believe the next generation deserves the care that I have to provide. I believe in the value of who I am. And I love what I do. I will persevere like my ancestors in hopes that the next generation will learn a little bit more tolerance and that my children will have it just a tiny bit easier. But after this, my heart may always be a bit broken. And I will never forget what happened to me just one week ago at 2748 Green Bay Rd.</strong>

<strong>I know better than most that people can hurt. I am not a stranger to heartache. But they tell me also, that people can heal. So whatever God you serve, whatever positive energy you implore, please, remember me. Ask for me. Pray for me.</strong>

Now, let's assume that the white security guard at Whole Foods wasn't aware of how racial insensitivity and unconscious racism plays out. Let's assume this is his first security job, and that he's never been anywhere near someone the likes of me who grocery shops in a rush...or is distracted...or has wrangled small kids at the checkout...or who thinks about her new teenage driver on the roads in the snow...or suddenly realizes she's forgotten the damn toilet paper. Let's assume he's never been there when the bagger and I both forget to lift up the plastic seat in the cart where the bottle of nail polish...the tube of lipstick...the translucent bottle of bug spray...the pack of batteries...the travel-size container of shampoo...the thin plastic container of basil/thyme/chives/oregano...the bottle of spices...the plastic bag with one jalepeño...the comb...or the greeting card envelope has been overlooked. Let's assume the 12-pack of LaCroix is on the bottom of the cart and somehow slips the attention of the cashier and never gets a PAID sticker applied to its cardboard packaging. Let's assume a three-year-old decides a single-serve sleeve of Oreos seems like the kind of thing Mom would love to find in her diaper bag (she would...but I digress). Let's assume the bottle of dishwasher rinse-aid or the bottle of vitamins slides down and along the child seat support bar, resting in a little nook so perfectly that no one notices it until the newbie security guard stops me and says, "Excuse me... you might not have noticed, but it looks like there's a..." However, I can only surmise that this security guard looked at Ashley Usher-Coleman and assumed, because she is black, that she was...there it is...untrustworthy. Because how else is it that the same kind of thing has happened to me and you and everyone we know, but if you're white, chances are you've never been handcuffed and charged with a misdemeanor for an oversight. Or an honest mistake. Or a flub. Or a mix-up. Or an Oh-My-God-I'm-So-Sorry moment that's corrected on the spot with a logical explanation.

Thing is, I don't know Ashley Usher-Coleman, but when her change.org page kept showing up in my feed, I wanted to know more about what happened, so I sent her a friend request on Facebook, then started asking questions. What happened?

"The vitamins were accidentally dropped into my large carry-all after I removed everything looking for my ChapStick," Ashley writes. "When I was putting everything back in, I inadvertently stuck those in as well. This according to the security guard because I actually have no recollection of doing so."

When did the guard stop you? Were you given a chance to pay?

"After I paid for my groceries," she writes. "And no, he did not offer me a chance to pay."

Ask yourself these questions and answer them as honestly as you can. Then ask the same questions, replacing "her/she" with "my/me/I":
Does the fact the vitamins were found in <strong>her</strong> bag raise more suspicion than if they'd been found in <strong>her</strong> cart? Can we assume the guard (or someone else) watched <strong>her</strong> dump out <strong>her</strong> bag's contents -- assuming <strong>she</strong> intended to steal? Was <strong>she</strong> being watched before <strong>she</strong> dumped out <strong>her</strong> bag?? Did <strong>she</strong> appear suspicious to someone for some reason?

All these questions aside, these three points I know to be true:
<ol>
	<li>I'm a 47-year old woman who's never once been stopped, harassed, or interrogated in a grocery store.</li>
	<li>I've had several moments when a cashier, a bagger, another shopper or even one of my kids has pointed out an overlooked item in my cart, under the cart or even in my diaper bag -- or that I discovered (with embarrassment) later. You can say I'm an airhead (and I am sometimes); you can even call me Winona Ryder-like for my very short stature; you can even call me for dinner anytime you like. But don't ever call me a shoplifter, because it's just not true.</li>
	<li>It's taking way too long to move this society into what feels like a fantastical, magical world called TRUE EQUALITY -- whereby a black woman in my own community can claim #1 above.</li>
</ol>
Still, let's assume the response to Ashley Usher-Coleman's Facebook post <a href="https://www.change.org/p/whole-foods-whole-foods-market-green-bay-road-whole-foods-market-green-bay-road-stop-the-racism?recruiter=46533596&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink"> and this Change.org petition</a> will get the conversation rolling, get people thinking, and inspire true change. Let's even assume that I've offered Ashley support by posting my own thoughts about the incident on Facebook when I shared <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-level-of-atrocity-must-whole-foods-commit-before-i-stop-shopping-there">Paula Kamen's piece from McSweeny's titled "What Level Of Atrocity Must Whole Foods Commit Before I Stop Shopping There?"</a> along with <a href="http://patch.com/illinois/evanston/evanston-woman-claims-whole-foods-had-her-arrested-because-she-black-0">Tim Moran's Patch.com column about the ongoing Whole Foods incident</a> -- and the caption: "Paula Kamen, here's the answer to your headline's question."

In response, a former high school classmate (female) offered Jeff Ruby's <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2010/Whole-Foods-Versus-Shoplifters-The-Conundrum">2010 Chicago Magazine column titled: Whole Foods And Shoplifters: The Conundrum</a> and the comment, "I remember this story from years ago. Similar."
An Evanston friend added: "This is interesting: the woman in [The Chicago Magazine piece] walks out [of the store]. The one in Evanston stays, but wants to talk to her husband and a lawyer. Lots of cultural differences and expectations here, on both sides of the conflict."
<span style="color: #ff0000;">But another former classmate (male) added: "A non-White person being held accountable for their actions (which they are not denying doing - just trying to 'explain'), with documented due process in full accordance with the law is not racism. Full stop."</span>
Another Evanston friend replied: "If they are being 'held accountable' in a way that a white person would not have then yes, it is racism. Full stop. And don't be so naive as to suggest that a white mother would have been treated the same." <br data-reactid=".1v.1:5:1:$replies10206442506755747_10206443938311535:0.1:2:$comment10206442506755747_10206444828213782:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1.$body.$comment-body.0.$end:0:$text1:0" /><span style="color: #ff0000;">The male classmate chimed back in: "100% agree with you... however, there is nothing in the article that supports that assertion and the other article posted actually refutes it, as that is the exact same situation - but with a white 'accidental or otherwise' shoplifter..</span>
Someone else (male) added: "The security guard targeted the non-white shopper. Why?"
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Male classmate: "In the [column about the Evanston incident], the shoplifter's lawyer asserts that she was targeted. That is not proof. The [Chicago Magazine article] details the exact same Whole Foods policy being enforced with a white shoplifter."</span>
Someone else (male): "In the Evanston encounter the security officer told police he had targeted "non white" customer...again why? She was then "arrested" because she wanted to talk to husband or Attorney about being requested to sign a document accuser her of being a shoplifter. To me..the targeting of this shopper introduces a racial component barring any other reason such as behavior. The rest is Whole Foods being heavy handed in both instances."
And then this doozy from a fellow writer (male): "Omg! Why are stores being so draconian about this...It's a fucking misdemeanor not a felony. You caught someone shoplifting, inadvertently or otherwise. Make them pay for their goods but don't act like they shot a busload of children for Christ sake."
<div data-reactid=".1v.1:5:1:$replies10206442506755747_10206443938311535:0.1:2:$comment10206442506755747_10206444828213782:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1.$body">All morning after reading these responses, I felt shaky and sick. I wanted to respond, particularly to the male classmate's comments, but I knew I'd only be screaming at a self-righteous wall. I even wrote a response and never sent it, proud not to have engaged in an irrational dialogue, giving the conversation (and my frustration) time to settle before hitting send. <strong></strong></div>
But <span style="color: #ff0000;">then, that former male classmate sent me a private message that reads, "C - you may find this interesting...I did", with a link to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-metta/i-racist_b_7770652.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">John Metta's "I, Racist",</span></a> a piece I'd already read</span> (and admired) when it first came out in June. And suddenly I was reminded how essential it is to stand up to this lunacy, no matter how often it appears or how insurmountable it seems. I'd been waiting to calm down...waiting to get more feedback from black friends, from experts on race relations, from different angles. But what I realized is, I can't wait for all of that support, nor do I need to. <strong>I can only share what I see as a simple truth: What happened to Ashley Usher-Coleman was racial discrimination.</strong> So here, without using his name, is my response to that male classmate for everyone to see:

<em>The blanket statements you made from the start of this thread immediately raised my dander. You "hate" Whole Foods for their "completely" fake claims? You "completely" agree with their response to actions you unequivocally declare to be theft ("the woman stole")? The shopper later described on Facebook that she didn't realize the vitamins were in her cart until she was walking out and the guard noticed them. Believe it or not, this happens to people and it is NOT stealing. It's called oversight, and it's happened countless times to me. Something slips down through the child-seat or under the plastic flip-up seat... things are easy to miss and are often pointed out by the person bagging the items or while unloading my groceries into a car. When's the last time you were shopping and this happened to you? It's embarrassing, but it's human, and it's not stealing when it's an oversight and the action is corrected. If this has never happened to you, be grateful; and if this ever happens to someone you love, ask if they were given an opportunity to correct an oversight that most white citizens automatically receive, rather than a blanket presumption of guilt. Innocent until proven guilty? What this woman wasn't afforded -- apparently due to her being black -- was an opportunity to correct her oversight. She was immediately accused of stealing and treated as such. With everything going on in this country -- rampant and unfair rushes to judgement, frequently based upon color -- it's no wonder this woman's defenses went up when she was asked to sign a paper admitting she'd shoplifted. I respectfully ask you to consider all sides of a situation -- including unconscious racism -- before making blanket statements and rushing to judgement. Otherwise, a) you're digging yourself deeper than you already are and b) if you're lucky, the store you hate (yet agree with [on this issue]) might have a vacant security guard position available.</em>

The nuance of racism, it seems, is so difficult for some of us to see that, unless it's pointed out to us, often repeatedly, it will continue. Have I offended someone in the writing of this piece? Regrettably, chances are that I have in some way, yet I'm willing to listen and keep moving toward racial equality. One thing I will not do is whisper -- and it seems neither does Ashley Usher-Coleman, thank God.).

Assuming we all make mistakes and we all want equality, Whole Foods has an opportunity to make things right by apologizing to Ashley Usher-Coleman, dropping the charges and, if nothing else, reprimanding the security guard. Short of that, the world will just go on as usual, with journalists citing Wikipedia, security guards singling out individuals based on race, and racial equality remaining just a fantastical, magical dream.

<blockquote>From Wikipedia:
"Shoplifting is typically undertaken by amateurs, and involves concealing an item and leaving the store without paying for it. Other forms of shoplifting include swapping price labels of different items, and eating a store's food without paying for it. Commonly shoplifted items are those with a high value in proportion to their size, such as razor blades and cigarettes. Retailers have reported that 0.6% of their inventory is lost to shoplifting. The term shoplifting and shoplifter has not been defined in Law. The word <b>shrinkage</b> is not a synonym for shoplifting, as it includes merchandise loss by means other than shoplifting."</blockquote>
And, with her permission, here is Ashley Usher-Coleman's description of the incident (from Facebook):
<div data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">

<strong>RACISM: ATTACK MY SPIRIT, BREAK MY HEART, BUT I WILL NOT BE WHO YOU WILL ME TO BE. I WILL REMAIN...BECAUSE I MUST.</strong>

<strong>My heart is broken. And try as I might I just cannot make this ache go away. I am typically an extremely private person. I don’t overshare on social media. For every one picture you see, there are fifty that you didn’t. My wedding had 18 attendees. And I can count with my fingers the number of people who truly know the depths and pain of my story. I aim to look forward, to continue to grow. And only look back to gain knowledge or to re-break bones that never healed properly. I try to be slow to anger and eager to listen/hear. Everybody has a story, I believe. Everyone has a reason they are the way they are, some deep part of their soul that is being trampled on. So perhaps, that’s why they judge and project. I can handle it, I say to myself, for I have been through far worse. But I think I’m tired. Courage takes strength. And strength, even the strongest kind, has its limits.</strong>

<strong>Every morning, for eleven years I get up, get dressed, grab a cup of coffee, and before I walk out the door I put on my brave face. I dig out my kind heart. I make sure I have my patience and empathy in my purse. I’m going to need it. Maybe even before I get to work, if I stop at the local coffee shop. I’m heading to Chicago’s Northshore. Or some days Chicago’s ritzier neighborhoods. I’m a veteran to these parts. I’m used to being pulled over because it “looked” like I was going to commit a traffic violation. I’m used to the shock on people’s faces when I comment that their street reminds me of the one I grew up on. I’m ready to answer the questions that arise when people find out that I went to private school. Were you bussed there? Did you earn a scholarship? I’m used to the wondering face when neither of those things turns out to be true. And the perplexed look on their faces as they try to register that a black man could be a business owner and indeed afford to send his daughter to private school all her life. That he came from poverty, but refused to go on government assistance when his parents died. As long as he was able, he would not depend on anyone. Even if that meant eating saltines and vienna sausages, he was going to work hard. He was going to be a business owner. "Ahhh...she’s the exception." Except I’m not. My school was 50% black. Most of my black friends have Master’s degrees and a few more have their Doctorate. The town I grew up in is filled with law abiding, educated, family oriented people contributing to society like everyone else. They are a part of their PTA’s. They run for public office. Plant community garden. Save for their children’s college education. Worry about raising kids who will also contribute to society. Most of this country was built on the backs of our ancestors. Most of our parents (and most definitely grandparents) can remember the Jim Crow south just 50 some odd years ago. When they couldn’t eat at most lunch counters. When they walked and walked and walked to make a way for their children, for us, for me. Most of our families bought homes and land that has been passed down through the generations so that no one in the family ever went without shelter. This though, goes over the head of many people I come across in the Chicagoland area. These things, this “ New Civil RIghts Movement” that has “come up” since Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown is baseless. If you encounter prejudice then you must have done something to arouse suspicion and make people see you that way. After all, these are new times. We have a black president…</strong>

<strong>...I call bullshit. Every day I have shown up for work, in a place where most people consider me a domestic (not that there is anything wrong with that.) Many shocked that I attended college. Fighting preconceived notions about why I do what I do. But I love it. I believe what it says in the Bible about how to treat the children. I believe more than anything that the greatest way I can contribute is by caring for the next generation. Of course, I’ve had my criticism from blacks as well, who wonder why I work in a predominantly white neighborhood. Why I take my talents and give them to well off “white” children. I can imagine that to them my days probably look like a chapter of The Help. That’s okay. I get it. But I’m an Early Childhood Professional. I’m a cuddler, a teacher, a boo-boo kisser, a cheerleader, a tutor, a hand to hold when one needs courage, a reminder to always be yourself, a bear hug when “being yourself” got your picked on at school, a high-five when the next day you had the courage to hold your head up high, a trustworthy mother figure for Littles so their mothers can make a living for them. But more than that I’m a contradiction. I’m a living, breathing example that what you learn about me on TV is not what is real. I am a safe place to ask race related questions that they may have never gotten a chance to ask until they are adults. I’m an educator of my culture and theirs since American is American and we all contributed. And while I have had the honor and privilege to work with some phenomenal families, when I go to the store, or the library, or the coffee shop I am subject to the looks, the questions, the security detail around the store. The being judged off hand for my race and not my character.</strong>

<strong>This is the reason for my heartache. Last week I was arrested. A security guard at the new Whole Foods on Green Bay had me arrested because I asked to speak to a lawyer. After purchasing $80 worth of groceries I inadvertently exited the store without one of my vitamins being paid for. It was an accident, of course. The security guard admitted that it appeared to be one and agreed to let me go with a warning. That is, if I agreed to sign a legal document stating that I was a shoplifter. I said, I would need to call my husband. To this he got extremely confused and agitated. He wanted to know why, and inquired “are you a child?” After informing him that I would need to wait for my lawyer to call back before signing any legal documents he rendered me belligerent, uncooperative, and had me arrested. Not for the vitamins but because he didn’t “feel like” waiting for my attorney to call back. (Though the entire process from start to finish was about 10 minutes.) Its absurd as I’m sure people make this mistake all the time. In fact, I know this to be true because I’ve asked. Most were given the opportunity to pay for said item and move on. Or given an ACTUAL warning (and not coerced into signing some paper) and let go. All of them were white. I know, I played the race card. I didn’t want to but I must since this security guard stated to the police that he had been watching me since I walked in the store. Really? Why? There is nothing spectacular about a women shopping for bread and vitamins. Nothing spectacular except my race. And because of this my name, my character, and 11 years of hard work are being dragged through the mud because I had the audacity to ask to confer with my lawyer first instead of allowing him to bully me into stating I was a criminal. I was handcuffed, searched, finger printed, and left in a cell for hours- which caused me to have a significant panic attack. For those that don’t know I have PTSD symptoms resulting from situations in small rooms very much like the one I was locked away in. And now I am being charged with a misdemeanor. I have never so much as been suspended from school. I have been left in charge of people's million dollar homes, cars, and more importantly their children are left in my care while they work or travel. All returned in the condition (and hopefully) better than they were left to me. For eleven years! I started my own business 5 months ago and haven’t had to spend anything on advertising. Just referrals have gotten me to a place where I have had to stop accepting new clients. And just like, on a whim, it can be taken away.</strong>

<strong>Answer me this, what is the point? Why should blacks who played by the rules, work hard, and contribute to society- why should we care? Why shouldn’t we all give up? Why shouldn’t we just forget it and become the people that the media portray us to be. Why are the Black Lives Matter protesters thugs and criminals when the Ted Bundy’s of the world are patriots? ARMED patriots. Why are our teenagers judged (and sentenced) more harshly than their counterparts regardless of the fact that most crimes they commit are the same and mostly minor. Why was my husband shoved and belittled last summer at Wrigley because we had to audacity to attend a Zac Brown Concert. Why have employers loved me on the phone and then turned me away, before even speaking to me, when I showed up for a second interview. "I’m sorry, we don’t have anything for you at this time." Why have I been pulled over for “looking like” I was going to commit a crime. Why have people's neighbors threatened to call the police on me when I was waiting outside for a friend, drinking coffee and reading the New York Times. And why, after eleven years of hard work in the community where I both serve and live am I followed from the moment I walk into a store? And then treated like a common criminal. I’m heartbroken. I feel as though Chicagoland has broken me. A crack here, a crack there. I feel like the girl who keeps loving someone who doesn’t love her. Who keeps “looking on the bright side” when really she should move on. Perhaps I should. I think of the Littles that I cared for this week. Will they remember that I held them until they were asleep. Will they remember that I helped them learn to read. Will they remember that I cheered loudly for them at their recitals, graduations, and music programs. Will they remember the hugs I gave when someone had broken their spirit? Or the way I held them up for hours because gas pains made them cry. Will they remember the laughs, the cries, the lessons, the adventures, the experiences that we had together. Will they remember THAT me when they see my culture portrayed on the television? Will they believe what people tell them about who I am, who we are, or what their spirits tell them? Or will the media and the nay-sayers win? Will the good in us always be judged by the misactions of a few of us. After it all, will they still grow up to follow someone around a store because of their skin color. I know they won’t. Their parents won’t allow it. But someone's children will. Perhaps I should give in and just be bitter. But I know I won’t. I can’t. It’s not who I am. I believe the next generation deserves the care that I have to provide. I believe in the value of who I am. And I love what I do. I will persevere like my ancestors in hopes that the next generation will learn a little bit more tolerance and that my children will have it just a tiny bit easier. But after this, my heart may always be a bit broken. And I will never forget what happened to me just one week ago at 2748 Green Bay Rd.</strong>

<strong>I know better than most that people can hurt. I am not a stranger to heartache. But they tell me also, that people can heal. So whatever God you serve, whatever positive energy you implore, please, remember me. Ask for me. Pray for me.</strong>

Now, let's assume that the white security guard at Whole Foods wasn't aware of how racial insensitivity and unconscious racism plays out. Let's assume this is his first security job, and that he's never been anywhere near someone the likes of me who grocery shops in a rush...or is distracted...or has wrangled small kids at the checkout...or who thinks about her new teenage driver on the roads in the snow...or suddenly realizes she's forgotten the damn toilet paper. Let's assume he's never been there when the bagger and I both forget to lift up the plastic seat in the cart where the bottle of nail polish...the tube of lipstick...the translucent bottle of bug spray...the pack of batteries...the travel-size container of shampoo...the thin plastic container of basil/thyme/chives/oregano...the bottle of spices...the plastic bag with one jalepeño...the comb...or the greeting card envelope has been overlooked. Let's assume the 12-pack of LaCroix is on the bottom of the cart and somehow slips the attention of the cashier and never gets a PAID sticker applied to its cardboard packaging. Let's assume a three-year-old decides a single-serve sleeve of Oreos seems like the kind of thing Mom would love to find in her diaper bag (she would...but I digress). Let's assume the bottle of dishwasher rinse-aid or the bottle of vitamins slides down and along the child seat support bar, resting in a little nook so perfectly that no one notices it until the newbie security guard stops me and says, "Excuse me... you might not have noticed, but it looks like there's a..." However, I can only surmise that this security guard looked at Ashley Usher-Coleman and assumed, because she is black, that she was...there it is...untrustworthy. Because how else is it that the same kind of thing has happened to me and you and everyone we know, but if you're white, chances are you've never been handcuffed and charged with a misdemeanor for an oversight. Or an honest mistake. Or a flub. Or a mix-up. Or an Oh-My-God-I'm-So-Sorry moment that's corrected on the spot with a logical explanation.

Thing is, I don't know Ashley Usher-Coleman, but when her change.org page kept showing up in my feed, I wanted to know more about what happened, so I sent her a friend request on Facebook, then started asking questions. What happened?

"The vitamins were accidentally dropped into my large carry-all after I removed everything looking for my ChapStick," Ashley writes. "When I was putting everything back in, I inadvertently stuck those in as well. This according to the security guard because I actually have no recollection of doing so."

When did the guard stop you? Were you given a chance to pay?

"After I paid for my groceries," she writes. "And no, he did not offer me a chance to pay."

Ask yourself these questions and answer them as honestly as you can. Then ask the same questions, replacing "her/she" with "my/me/I":
Does the fact the vitamins were found in <strong>her</strong> bag raise more suspicion than if they'd been found in <strong>her</strong> cart? Can we assume the guard (or someone else) watched <strong>her</strong> dump out <strong>her</strong> bag's contents -- assuming <strong>she</strong> intended to steal? Was <strong>she</strong> being watched before <strong>she</strong> dumped out <strong>her</strong> bag?? Did <strong>she</strong> appear suspicious to someone for some reason?

All these questions aside, these three points I know to be true:
<ol>
	<li>I'm a 47-year old woman who's never once been stopped, harassed, or interrogated in a grocery store.</li>
	<li>I've had several moments when a cashier, a bagger, another shopper or even one of my kids has pointed out an overlooked item in my cart, under the cart or even in my diaper bag -- or that I discovered (with embarrassment) later. You can say I'm an airhead (and I am sometimes); you can even call me Winona Ryder-like for my very short stature; you can even call me for dinner anytime you like. But don't ever call me a shoplifter, because it's just not true.</li>
	<li>It's taking way too long to move this society into what feels like a fantastical, magical world called TRUE EQUALITY -- whereby a black woman in my own community can claim #1 above.</li>
</ol>
Still, let's assume the response to Ashley Usher-Coleman's Facebook post <a href="https://www.change.org/p/whole-foods-whole-foods-market-green-bay-road-whole-foods-market-green-bay-road-stop-the-racism?recruiter=46533596&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink"> and this Change.org petition</a> will get the conversation rolling, get people thinking, and inspire true change. Let's even assume that I've offered Ashley support by posting my own thoughts about the incident on Facebook when I shared <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-level-of-atrocity-must-whole-foods-commit-before-i-stop-shopping-there">Paula Kamen's piece from McSweeny's titled "What Level Of Atrocity Must Whole Foods Commit Before I Stop Shopping There?"</a> along with <a href="http://patch.com/illinois/evanston/evanston-woman-claims-whole-foods-had-her-arrested-because-she-black-0">Tim Moran's Patch.com column about the ongoing Whole Foods incident</a> -- and the caption: "Paula Kamen, here's the answer to your headline's question."

In response, a former high school classmate (female) offered Jeff Ruby's <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2010/Whole-Foods-Versus-Shoplifters-The-Conundrum">2010 Chicago Magazine column titled: Whole Foods And Shoplifters: The Conundrum</a> and the comment, "I remember this story from years ago. Similar."
An Evanston friend added: "This is interesting: the woman in [The Chicago Magazine piece] walks out [of the store]. The one in Evanston stays, but wants to talk to her husband and a lawyer. Lots of cultural differences and expectations here, on both sides of the conflict."
<span style="color: #ff0000;">But another former classmate (male) added: "A non-White person being held accountable for their actions (which they are not denying doing - just trying to 'explain'), with documented due process in full accordance with the law is not racism. Full stop."</span>
Another Evanston friend replied: "If they are being 'held accountable' in a way that a white person would not have then yes, it is racism. Full stop. And don't be so naive as to suggest that a white mother would have been treated the same." <br data-reactid=".1v.1:5:1:$replies10206442506755747_10206443938311535:0.1:2:$comment10206442506755747_10206444828213782:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1.$body.$comment-body.0.$end:0:$text1:0" /><span style="color: #ff0000;">The male classmate chimed back in: "100% agree with you... however, there is nothing in the article that supports that assertion and the other article posted actually refutes it, as that is the exact same situation - but with a white 'accidental or otherwise' shoplifter..</span>
Someone else (male) added: "The security guard targeted the non-white shopper. Why?"
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Male classmate: "In the [column about the Evanston incident], the shoplifter's lawyer asserts that she was targeted. That is not proof. The [Chicago Magazine article] details the exact same Whole Foods policy being enforced with a white shoplifter."</span>
Someone else (male): "In the Evanston encounter the security officer told police he had targeted "non white" customer...again why? She was then "arrested" because she wanted to talk to husband or Attorney about being requested to sign a document accuser her of being a shoplifter. To me..the targeting of this shopper introduces a racial component barring any other reason such as behavior. The rest is Whole Foods being heavy handed in both instances."
And then this doozy from a fellow writer (male): "Omg! Why are stores being so draconian about this...It's a fucking misdemeanor not a felony. You caught someone shoplifting, inadvertently or otherwise. Make them pay for their goods but don't act like they shot a busload of children for Christ sake."
<div data-reactid=".1v.1:5:1:$replies10206442506755747_10206443938311535:0.1:2:$comment10206442506755747_10206444828213782:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1.$body">All morning after reading these responses, I felt shaky and sick. I wanted to respond, particularly to the male classmate's comments, but I knew I'd only be screaming at a self-righteous wall. I even wrote a response and never sent it, proud not to have engaged in an irrational dialogue, giving the conversation (and my frustration) time to settle before hitting send. <strong></strong></div>
But <span style="color: #ff0000;">then, that former male classmate sent me a private message that reads, "C - you may find this interesting...I did", with a link to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-metta/i-racist_b_7770652.html"><span style="color: #ff0000;">John Metta's "I, Racist",</span></a> a piece I'd already read</span> (and admired) when it first came out in June. And suddenly I was reminded how essential it is to stand up to this lunacy, no matter how often it appears or how insurmountable it seems. I'd been waiting to calm down...waiting to get more feedback from black friends, from experts on race relations, from different angles. But what I realized is, I can't wait for all of that support, nor do I need to. <strong>I can only share what I see as a simple truth: What happened to Ashley Usher-Coleman was racial discrimination.</strong> So here, without using his name, is my response to that male classmate for everyone to see:

<em>The blanket statements you made from the start of this thread immediately raised my dander. You "hate" Whole Foods for their "completely" fake claims? You "completely" agree with their response to actions you unequivocally declare to be theft ("the woman stole")? The shopper later described on Facebook that she didn't realize the vitamins were in her cart until she was walking out and the guard noticed them. Believe it or not, this happens to people and it is NOT stealing. It's called oversight, and it's happened countless times to me. Something slips down through the child-seat or under the plastic flip-up seat... things are easy to miss and are often pointed out by the person bagging the items or while unloading my groceries into a car. When's the last time you were shopping and this happened to you? It's embarrassing, but it's human, and it's not stealing when it's an oversight and the action is corrected. If this has never happened to you, be grateful; and if this ever happens to someone you love, ask if they were given an opportunity to correct an oversight that most white citizens automatically receive, rather than a blanket presumption of guilt. Innocent until proven guilty? What this woman wasn't afforded -- apparently due to her being black -- was an opportunity to correct her oversight. She was immediately accused of stealing and treated as such. With everything going on in this country -- rampant and unfair rushes to judgement, frequently based upon color -- it's no wonder this woman's defenses went up when she was asked to sign a paper admitting she'd shoplifted. I respectfully ask you to consider all sides of a situation -- including unconscious racism -- before making blanket statements and rushing to judgement. Otherwise, a) you're digging yourself deeper than you already are and b) if you're lucky, the store you hate (yet agree with [on this issue]) might have a vacant security guard position available.</em>

The nuance of racism, it seems, is so difficult for some of us to see that, unless it's pointed out to us, often repeatedly, it will continue. Have I offended someone in the writing of this piece? Regrettably, chances are that I have in some way, yet I'm willing to listen and keep moving toward racial equality. One thing I will not do is whisper -- and it seems neither does Ashley Usher-Coleman, thank God.).

Assuming we all make mistakes and we all want equality, Whole Foods has an opportunity to make things right by apologizing to Ashley Usher-Coleman, dropping the charges and, if nothing else, reprimanding the security guard. Short of that, the world will just go on as usual, with journalists citing Wikipedia, security guards singling out individuals based on race, and racial equality remaining just a fantastical, magical dream.

I'd kept journals in my youth and written more than my fair share of thank you notes and emails and logs of vacations to help recall details, but my desire to create <em>something of substance</em> finally inspired me to become a writer and discover the passion I'd buried for years. If you've ever wondered, "How do I find my passion?" here's my advice on finding it and keeping it strong.
<h2>False Start #1</h2>
Less than a year out of college, I (at 23) married my husband (then 22). Looking back, we were such babies -- and yes, I robbed the cradle.

During our first few months of dating, I learned how much he loved sailing. I remember the first time we sailed together on a small, inland lake. He said I was a natural. I'd never been sailing like this before. Maybe I was meant to be a sailor? It was a sign! I convinced myself that my hobby -- my passion -- was sailing, a belief I held for the first 17 years of our marriage.

But it was during our first year of our marriage that I also experienced my first episode of depression.

It was 1992, when few people spoke openly about mental health and medication. Anti-depressants were oddities and whispers, not the openly advertised revenue-generators they've become today. I felt ashamed that I wasn't always a happy, content, optimistic young wife, and that something inside often felt hollow and lost. I'd look to my husband, trying his best to understand me, and wonder why I couldn't shake these overwhelming feelings of sadness. I asked myself why he'd even married me. I felt inadequate. Confused.

Why did this cloud hang over me? When might it appear again?

I'd pour my heart into my journal to cheer myself up and fortify my self-confidence. It always helped to process what bothered me in this way, because time again, watching the words appear on the page seemed to sooth my feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. The familiarity of each letter and the control I wielded -- even with a pen -- helped to calm my nerves and gain perspective. I didn't understand how or why, but it worked nearly every time.

Feeling ready to have a baby before my husband only added to my feelings of sadness. He'd changed careers and started grad school, so he wanted to fortify our savings before starting a family. Totally reasonable (and wise). Yet the pages from my journal reveal how utterly empty I felt. Plus, I was in a miserable job and felt completely inadequate. In one entry, I included details from my latest performance evaluation (not stellar) and told myself that I just had to try harder, stay more focused, get in earlier, stay later. <em>Things will click,</em> I counseled myself. <em>You're still figuring it out. You're only 25 years old. You're a good person and you know it.</em> But as my work drained my emotional strength and my episodes of sadness became more frequent, I sought more sessions with a therapist -- and put someone else in charge of  documenting my sadness. As much as the therapy helped, I regret that I stopped writing altogether.

In its place, I looked to sailing with my husband for comfort and reassurance. I wasn't a lifelong sailor like him, but it was something we both enjoyed doing together. From purchasing our first small boat to spending Sundays, rain or shine, on a tiny lake every summer, sailing was our constant. It provided structure, context, and frequently a subject to focus on besides my moods. I'd hear the woes of my peers who were golf widows (or abandoned by their workaholic partners) and think  <em>I'm lucky to share this passion with my spouse. </em>Our time on the water felt a lot like church: a sacred, often silent, togetherness on Sundays.

Then, as the arrival of three babies in five years kept me anchored closer to shore, I missed my husband and our time together --  yet I increasingly declined opportunities to join him on the boat. <em>The kids need me</em>, I rationalized, even though grandparents constantly offered to help us out. Returning from Sunday afternoon races, my husband would be flushed and full of stories, but I somehow didn't miss the action; I really only missed him. As the sun went down, we'd pass the kids back and forth and I came to see that sailing really wasn't my passion, rather my way to be with my husband. I wasn't a true sailor, just a sailor-by-marriage. My true passion, I told myself, was nurturing these three little ones that I'd been waiting for my entire life. I'd never before felt as adequate or needed, so I threw myself into my "new" passion: motherhood.
<h2>False Start #2</h2>
But ask any mom and you will learn: you can't make your entire life about your kids (or anyone, for that matter). Otherwise, you'll lose yourself. And I did.

Sure, I took the occasional weekend away and found sitters who provided healthy breaks, but for too many years I wandered through my days, wondering what -- besides mothering and teaching kids -- I was <em>truly</em> passionate about.

When I'd hear my husband talk about how, on cold winter nights, he'd fall asleep thinking about summer sails and harrowing jibes and broad reaches, I'd feel an emptiness. What did I fall asleep dreaming about? At times it might have been an upcoming vacation, but usually it was grocery lists, classroom art activities and endless to-do lists, including all the things to pack and coordinate before that upcoming vacation.

When I'd place my husband's monthly magazines on his bedside table, like <em>Sailing World</em>, <em>SAIL</em>, <em>Sailing</em> and <em>Wooden Boat</em>, I'd look at my own haphazard pile, <em>Real Simple</em>, <em>People</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and <em>The Enquirer,</em> wondering what they revealed about me besides a desire to get more organized and a pathetic fascination with celebrity.

When I'd wrap Christmas ornaments for my husband -- sailboats and seagulls and anchors and lighthouses -- I'd wonder what ornaments he and the kids might select for me, especially when I no longer recognized who "me" even was.
<h2>Nothing To Lose...Except A Salary</h2>
And so, facing my 40th birthday and the realization I'd soon have all three kids in school, I listened to the echoes of a mysterious void deep inside my soul. With the support and encouragement of my husband (by then an attorney), I went for broke, literally: I requested a year's sabbatical from my teaching job and dove in head first to my long-lost passion: writing.

It was the only thing I knew how to do easily besides mothering and teaching. It was the only thing I could think of that made me feel consistently good about myself. It was the only activity I'd always gone back to, over and over and over again, during good times and bad times and rough times and the rest.

<em>Maybe I just need to write about my feelings of losing myself</em>, I thought. <em>Maybe I should write about depression and that it's worth talking about. Maybe once I do these things, I'll discover my true passion. </em>I hadn't yet realized that writing IS my passion.
<h2>How To Claim Your Passion</h2>
Only once I began writing did I allow my passion to reveal itself. What does that look like? I'd already come to know the joy and relief writing brought to my life, but what I hadn't yet done was to fight for it, find its possibilities and foresee your future:

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protection Of Time</span>

You've got to fight for it, and I'm not talking about boxing gloves or bickering. I'm talking about rearranging my time, my activities and my thoughts around making time for my writing. I'm talking about giving up something I would have loved doing, like going to a concert, sleeping in, or having lunch with a friend, and putting writing first. With writing as my anchor, I now had a structure and a focus I'd been lacking -- and it ultimately helped me to make the most of all the other activities I wanted to do. Lunches with friends still happen, and they include even deeper conversations than before. I'll still make time to sleep in, oftentimes as a reward for an especially productive writing weekend. And my concert attendance hasn't altogether ceased -- it's just perhaps more selective to allow enough time for friends, family and, naturally, writing. Protecting time to devote to your passion builds even more respect and desire for it.

2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perspectives Are Endless</span>

When I first set out to write, I thought I'd start with a children's book because books for kids just have to be easier to get published than adult books, right? Not only was I wrong, but the education I gained learning why that isn't so was astonishing. I hadn't appreciated how big the children's publishing world was, or how many success stories and failures it held, or how many opportunities there were to reach young readers. At first overwhelmed by how much I had to learn about publishing, I quickly found a tribe of likeminded people figuring it all out. Some of those people were newbies like me, and some had hundreds of published titles to their names. What we all shared was a thirst to grow as writers. Some, like me, were learning from scratch. Others, who'd been around for years, sought inspiration and new methods to reach readers. Some hoped to switch genres, while others explored new ways to share their talents (spoken word, podcasting, blogging). The more time I spent writing, the more opportunities I discovered and the more interesting people I'd meet.

3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Picture Yourself As You Want To Be</span>

When I first began writing, I kept apologizing to myself and others.

"I'm new." "I've only been doing this a short time." "I didn't go to journalism school." "I don't have a lot of experience." "I don't have an agent." "I'll never has as many published books/followers/comments/good reviews as that writer." "I'm just a mom."

And that didn't get me anywhere.

What kicked things off was putting myself out there, as inexperienced and scared as I was (and believe me, I was terrified). Who'd want to read anything I had to say?

I stopped trying to picture that faceless, critical mass of judgement and, instead, imagined writing to a supportive, caring friend. <a href="http://ridingthewaves.me/2010/01/26/this-is-what-i-do/">I created a free Wordpress blog and wrote about what I was doing.</a> I was no expert, but I knew I wanted to be a writer. The post was liberating and removed a ton of self-imposed pressure to produce something -- anything.

There. Now I had something to share. Now I had something that officially proved that I was a writer. Well, sort of.

Granted, it was just my own blog. Granted, my confidence was still low, but that first step was behind me, and it gave me the boost I needed to take the second step, the third, and so on. I've lost count which step I'm on now, but that's okay. Having ANY number in the "done" column, even if it's just ONE, is more motivating than having ZERO.

And the best part is, all these little steps are adding up.

To be sure, I've had no map, and my steps often meander. I don't always follow a straight (or easy) path, and several steps have led me to utterly and sometimes devastating dead ends. But, since I started writing in 2009, I've accomplished more than I ever imagined as a writer, like launching a blog, creating a website, becoming a weekly columnist, performing live lit, launching a podcast series, interviewing the President of the United States, attending writing conferences in Illinois, New York, Iowa and Pennsylvania and starting my own business running a writers' retreat. I've been paid for my writing on topics ranging from community tragedies, politics, motherhood, race, education, business, marriage and the arts.

And I've also failed spectacularly. I've received some nasty, hurtful comments from readers, received numerous rejection letters from editors and publishers, had columns I loved rejected after working on them for months, and written about topics I wish I hadn't. And have I mentioned that I'm starting my children's novel over -- from scratch?

While it might be easy to dwell in all my failures and my struggles and just convince myself I'll never go anywhere as a writer, I will not quit because this is my passion. I'm confident there's more in store for me. I've got so much more to learn about writing (and about myself), and the fact I look forward to what's to come is proof I'm doing what I'm meant to do.

All those heartaches and false starts before I discovered my true passion?  I think they all happened for a reason -- and contribute to who I am as a writer. For example, I can now identify with and describe the painful yearning of someone aching for a child, or the surreal, prison-like awareness living with depression without tools to escape. I can write about the unbearable weight that disappears upon leaving a miserable job, and that once-in-a-lifetime, out-of-nowhere, brilliant puff of wind that edges your bow first across the starting line.

There's no formula for finding and keeping your passion, so if you're overwhelmed, let go of everything you <strong>think</strong> you know. What is it that boosts your comfort and confidence? Please share your journey in the comments section, because you just might inspire someone to find their passion, too.

I'd kept journals in my youth and written more than my fair share of thank you notes and emails and logs of vacations to help recall details, but my desire to create <em>something of substance</em> finally inspired me to become a writer and discover the passion I'd buried for years. If you've ever wondered, "How do I find my passion?" here's my advice on finding it and keeping it strong.
<h2>False Start #1</h2>
Less than a year out of college, I (at 23) married my husband (then 22). Looking back, we were such babies -- and yes, I robbed the cradle.

During our first few months of dating, I learned how much he loved sailing. I remember the first time we sailed together on a small, inland lake. He said I was a natural. I'd never been sailing like this before. Maybe I was meant to be a sailor? It was a sign! I convinced myself that my hobby -- my passion -- was sailing, a belief I held for the first 17 years of our marriage.

But it was during our first year of our marriage that I also experienced my first episode of depression.

It was 1992, when few people spoke openly about mental health and medication. Anti-depressants were oddities and whispers, not the openly advertised revenue-generators they've become today. I felt ashamed that I wasn't always a happy, content, optimistic young wife, and that something inside often felt hollow and lost. I'd look to my husband, trying his best to understand me, and wonder why I couldn't shake these overwhelming feelings of sadness. I asked myself why he'd even married me. I felt inadequate. Confused.

Why did this cloud hang over me? When might it appear again?

I'd pour my heart into my journal to cheer myself up and fortify my self-confidence. It always helped to process what bothered me in this way, because time again, watching the words appear on the page seemed to sooth my feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. The familiarity of each letter and the control I wielded -- even with a pen -- helped to calm my nerves and gain perspective. I didn't understand how or why, but it worked nearly every time.

Feeling ready to have a baby before my husband only added to my feelings of sadness. He'd changed careers and started grad school, so he wanted to fortify our savings before starting a family. Totally reasonable (and wise). Yet the pages from my journal reveal how utterly empty I felt. Plus, I was in a miserable job and felt completely inadequate. In one entry, I included details from my latest performance evaluation (not stellar) and told myself that I just had to try harder, stay more focused, get in earlier, stay later. <em>Things will click,</em> I counseled myself. <em>You're still figuring it out. You're only 25 years old. You're a good person and you know it.</em> But as my work drained my emotional strength and my episodes of sadness became more frequent, I sought more sessions with a therapist -- and put someone else in charge of  documenting my sadness. As much as the therapy helped, I regret that I stopped writing altogether.

In its place, I looked to sailing with my husband for comfort and reassurance. I wasn't a lifelong sailor like him, but it was something we both enjoyed doing together. From purchasing our first small boat to spending Sundays, rain or shine, on a tiny lake every summer, sailing was our constant. It provided structure, context, and frequently a subject to focus on besides my moods. I'd hear the woes of my peers who were golf widows (or abandoned by their workaholic partners) and think  <em>I'm lucky to share this passion with my spouse. </em>Our time on the water felt a lot like church: a sacred, often silent, togetherness on Sundays.

Then, as the arrival of three babies in five years kept me anchored closer to shore, I missed my husband and our time together --  yet I increasingly declined opportunities to join him on the boat. <em>The kids need me</em>, I rationalized, even though grandparents constantly offered to help us out.

Oh, now that's rich! Seriously?

Thank God he gave me a day or two to think about it, because at this point, nothing's jumping to mind.

Of course, had he asked for what I totally suck at, I could have offered an earful. My brain floods daily with all the things I'm lousy at. The list runs like a news crawler at the bottom of a TV screen, a constant presence I've just learned to live with.

It occurs to me, though, that in order to identify the things I'm actually good at, I must first purge the negative to make room for the positive. And so, using this post as my mental dumping ground, here's a list of 75 things I totally suck at:

1. Making my bed in the morning.

24. Sticking to a regular schedule of household maintenance.

25. Making church a priority.

26. Seeing the glass as half full.

27. Carrying on a conversation while music is playing loudly.

32. Following posted speed limits.

Sad and pathetic, but at least these things are now off my chest and out in the open. It's a start, right?  And hopefully, all my positive traits and expert qualities have a little more room to breathe and make themselves known.

For what it's worth, it feels like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. Feeling the urge to unload? Feel free to share in the comments below. What do you totally suck at?
