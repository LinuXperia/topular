The owner of Nuway Community Services, which is the holding company for the clinic, Mr. Olajide Soloja did come and address the community,

The building at 110 E 79th has been a medical building for years but has changed hands over the years as doctors and doctor groups including the City of Chicago health clinic moved out or died.

At the meeting, a number of residents openly discussed personal and family issues with drug addition and understand the need for services but did not condone the behavior of some of Nuway's clients behavior. Also, the owner of Gilead Behavior Health Clinic located at 132 E 79th scolded the owner for not taking a more proactive role in monitoring what is going on and around his facility because it is having a negative affect on other operators in the building who have operated for years basically transparent to the community. One operator that is located in the building, Emages which offers services to those convicted of DUI's, also disclosed they have a program for sex offenders and have operated for over 15 years. The representative did not go into detail but there will be a follow up with the owner on what kind of services they are offering.

Several, Nuway employees made passionate presentations about how they came to work for Nuway. They all stated they completed similar programs and used it as springboard to become counselors and other positions. One employee's presentation caught the attention of the crowd as he asked for the opportunity to work on a solution to the problem. Stating that it was highly unlikely the owner would relocate the clinic since he owned the building, it was in everyone's best interest to try and identify the issues and work on a solution.

The audience requested that this gentleman represent the clinic on the task force that was being set up. The task force was suggested and a cross section of residents volunteered to serve. Yes, some left the meeting just as upset as they came in the meeting and want the facility to relocate and others left upset for other reasons We will see if there if the follow through that was stated will actually happen.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Worlee";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3713:"This past Saturday, January 24th, Alderman Roderick Sawyer hosted a town hall meeting on Nuway Methadone Clinic.

He didn't provide the answers that most of the 100+ in attendance wanted to hear. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/concerned-citizens-of-chatham/files/2015/01/nuway-mtg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3377" alt="nuway mtg" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/concerned-citizens-of-chatham/files/2015/01/nuway-mtg.jpg" width="300" height="195" /></a>He stated that the business was previously located on the 600-700 E 75th vicinity. One remark that he made especially didn't go over well with most is when he indicated he now owns the b<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/concerned-citizens-of-chatham/files/2015/01/methadone-79th.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3367 alignleft" alt="methadone-79th" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/concerned-citizens-of-chatham/files/2015/01/methadone-79th.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>uilding located at 110 E 79th. He stated he is making improvements to the property but that didn't mean much to the audience.

The building at 110 E 79th has been a medical building for years but has changed hands over the years as doctors and doctor groups including the City of Chicago health clinic moved out or died.

At the meeting, a number of residents openly discussed personal and family issues with drug addition and understand the need for services but did not condone the behavior of some of Nuway's clients behavior. Also, the owner of Gilead Behavior Health Clinic located at 132 E 79th scolded the owner for not taking a more proactive role in monitoring what is going on and around his facility because it is having a negative affect on other operators in the building who have operated for years basically transparent to the community. One operator that is located in the building, Emages which offers services to those convicted of DUI's, also disclosed they have a program for sex offenders and have operated for over 15 years. The representative did not go into detail but there will be a follow up with the owner on what kind of services they are offering.

Several, Nuway employees made passionate presentations about how they came to work for Nuway. They all stated they completed similar programs and used it as springboard to become counselors and other positions. One employee's presentation caught the attention of the crowd as he asked for the opportunity to work on a solution to the problem. Stating that it was highly unlikely the owner would relocate the clinic since he owned the building, it was in everyone's best interest to try and identify the issues and work on a solution.

The audience requested that this gentleman represent the clinic on the task force that was being set up. The task force was suggested and a cross section of residents volunteered to serve. Yes, some left the meeting just as upset as they came in the meeting and want the facility to relocate and others left upset for other reasons We will see if there if the follow through that was stated will actually happen.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

Over the next couple of weeks practically every major intersection will have a "dance troupe" with individuals from 8-80 years old, hanging on the corner soliciting funds for "uniforms". One of the groups of solicitors we have on 87th are the Bud Billiken parade participants. So I decided to contact the parade organizers about the solicitation.

The parade organizers explained to me that there is an entry fee for dance troupes of $500. The money is for the cost of a car to carry sound equipment that they need to play the music these groups perform to. It was also stated that they encourage these groups to have fundraisers such as block parties, car washes, etc to raise funds to pay for the cost of parade fees and uniforms.

So with that said, I asked were they aware of the street corner solicitations by groups who alleged are parade participants. The answer was Yes we are aware and there is nothing we can do about it. Yes they are aware of individuals and groups misrepresenting their participation in the parade. Yes, they are aware of the street corner solicitation. Also, No we do not endorse it but we tell them if they are doing it to do it safely and not run out in the street and between cars in traffic.

So I went back and forth with the representative based on her answer and she stood firm on her position and when I stated that solicitation on 87th street is illegal, she basically brushed off my comment.

So the bottom line here is as long as the parade gets their entry fee they don't care how the participants of the parade conduct themselves.

If the product claims are true, this would be a great product for Chicago. The city has a major problem with tires being dumped all over the place. This could encouraged tire repair and replacement shops to properly dispose of tires
by giving them a monetary incentives as Chicago is in constant need of asphalt. Secondly, it could also keep areas of the city from becoming dumping grounds for asphalt removed from public and private sites. There would not be a need to create a "silver shovel" site as there would again be a demand for used asphalt.

Overall, as the pothole problem is out of control in Chicago and the city can't "hot patch" until late May an alternative is desperately needed.

The school is reported to  have signed a lease that would pay an affiliate of  Fellowship  Missionary Baptist Church who's pastor is Charles Jenkins, $1.0 million in yearly rent.  Mr. Jenkins  is a trusted advisor to Mayor Rahm Emmanuel. Many believe that this figure is out of line compared to what other schools are paying for similar space. Many believe this is a diabolical covert way of publicly funding a church pastored by an ally of the mayor. The church with an estimated congregation of 6,000 is planning to relocate on adjacent land and build several buildings<a title="Legacy Project" href="http://legacyprojectchicago.com/"> http://legacyprojectchicago.com/</a>.

<span style="font-size: 13px;">The Chatham community has a number of churches. There are churches of all denominations and faiths.  A number of these churches have dwindling congregations for a variety of reasons. Prior to the announcement, it was announced that to the east of Chatham in the 8th ward  at 1021 E 78th Street that Alderman Michelle Harris gave another megagchurch, New Life Covenant, several city owned lots so they could build their church complex. New Life Covenant has an estimated congregation of 6,000 members and is pastored by radio personality Mr. John Hannah. </span>

While most would see a combined estimated $60-80 million in developments  as a positive to the respective communities, there comes some issues with these churches. Several years ago, Pastor and former State Senator James Meeks of Salem Baptist church started a crusade to close stores in Roseland  that sold liquor and tobacco that his church deemed "undesirable". He was successful in closing stores but the strip of Michigan Ave. between 100th-119th has not seen any businesses come in to take the place of those that are closed and until the recent opening of Walmart was left without a grocery store.

In Chatham, along 79th street there are several liquor store and lounges. Most are law abiding, while one has become the target of community leaders to get closed and was closed for several months.  So the question in my mind is as a resident of Chatham who is of legal age, sound mind, taxpaying and law abiding citizen do I lose my right to purchase wine and spirits as a result of the church moving nearby and a bunch of people who come into the neighborhood one day for several hours feel that its not what they want?

In west Chatham, the proposed Fellowship MBC development will end adjacent to the parking area of the new Studio Movie Grill-Chatham. SMG-Chatham is on track for renovations of its lobby and the renovations will place a small scale casual dining restaurant  that will include a bar. The theater itself has been at 210 W 87th for over 16 years but when the church moves in and disagrees with a particular movie or the serving of wine and spirits do I lose my chose as a legal age. law abiding, sound mind and tax paying citizen?

While the churches may believe that they can provide alternatives I believe not. They are not going to be able to replace the 150 jobs at SMG-Chatham and the other jobs lost along 79th street. Also, will younger families want to move to a community that offers no entertainment venues? These are questions the Chatham community will have to answer.

What do you think?

The school is reported to  have signed a lease that would pay an affiliate of  Fellowship  Missionary Baptist Church who's pastor is Charles Jenkins, $1.0 million in yearly rent.  Mr. Jenkins  is a trusted advisor to Mayor Rahm Emmanuel. Many believe that this figure is out of line compared to what other schools are paying for similar space. Many believe this is a diabolical covert way of publicly funding a church pastored by an ally of the mayor. The church with an estimated congregation of 6,000 is planning to relocate on adjacent land and build several buildings<a title="Legacy Project" href="http://legacyprojectchicago.com/"> http://legacyprojectchicago.com/</a>.

<span style="font-size: 13px;">The Chatham community has a number of churches. There are churches of all denominations and faiths.  A number of these churches have dwindling congregations for a variety of reasons. Prior to the announcement, it was announced that to the east of Chatham in the 8th ward  at 1021 E 78th Street that Alderman Michelle Harris gave another megagchurch, New Life Covenant, several city owned lots so they could build their church complex. New Life Covenant has an estimated congregation of 6,000 members and is pastored by radio personality Mr. John Hannah. </span>

While most would see a combined estimated $60-80 million in developments  as a positive to the respective communities, there comes some issues with these churches. Several years ago, Pastor and former State Senator James Meeks of Salem Baptist church started a crusade to close stores in Roseland  that sold liquor and tobacco that his church deemed "undesirable". He was successful in closing stores but the strip of Michigan Ave. between 100th-119th has not seen any businesses come in to take the place of those that are closed and until the recent opening of Walmart was left without a grocery store.

In Chatham, along 79th street there are several liquor store and lounges. Most are law abiding, while one has become the target of community leaders to get closed and was closed for several months.  So the question in my mind is as a resident of Chatham who is of legal age, sound mind, taxpaying and law abiding citizen do I lose my right to purchase wine and spirits as a result of the church moving nearby and a bunch of people who come into the neighborhood one day for several hours feel that its not what they want?

In west Chatham, the proposed Fellowship MBC development will end adjacent to the parking area of the new Studio Movie Grill-Chatham. SMG-Chatham is on track for renovations of its lobby and the renovations will place a small scale casual dining restaurant  that will include a bar. The theater itself has been at 210 W 87th for over 16 years but when the church moves in and disagrees with a particular movie or the serving of wine and spirits do I lose my chose as a legal age. law abiding, sound mind and tax paying citizen?

While the churches may believe that they can provide alternatives I believe not. They are not going to be able to replace the 150 jobs at SMG-Chatham and the other jobs lost along 79th street. Also, will younger families want to move to a community that offers no entertainment venues? These are questions the Chatham community will have to answer.

What do you think?

<blockquote><strong>NEWS</strong><strong>For Immediate Release</strong>

Soft Sheen Property Donated to Historic Chicago Church

<strong><i>Fellowship M.B. Church advances plan to bring commerce, hope, jobs to the city</i></strong>

CHICAGO, January 6, 2013 – Churchgoers attending Sunday worship services at Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church received the good word and some good news too, as Pastor Charles Jenkins announced that the historic church is now the proud owner of a historic property – the former headquarters of the Soft Sheen beauty products company.

The 14.5-acre site will be the new location of the church and a mixed-use development project, which promises to enhance the social fabric of the community holistically, marking a major milestone in a broad vision for the property at 8522 S. Lafayette Ave.

The irrevocable, landmark multimillion-dollar donation comes from the foundation of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., an Oklahoma City-based national arts and crafts chain that has contributed to faith-based initiatives nationwide for many years.

“I offer my sincere gratitude to the Green Family for their unparalleled generosity to Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church and our work in the city,” Pastor Jenkins said. “We are excited about this huge step and other amazing friends and partners who are already joining us on this meaningful and impactful journey to serve inner city Chicago.”

With an average of 4,000 weekend attendees in the Chicago area and some 25,000 online worshippers, Fellowship has outgrown its current facility at 4543 S. Princeton Ave., and has a vision for more than a new church. Hence, four years ago, Fellowship established its economic development arm, the Fellowship Educational and Economic Development Corporation (F.E.E.D.), and launched an ambitious expansion and community development initiative called the Legacy Project, setting its sights on the former Soft Sheen headquarters. The site has sat vacant for 11 years.

The mission of the Legacy Project is to build people and community by focusing on personal growth, job creation, education, youth development, healthcare, economic development, and community empowerment.

Plans additionally call for renovation of the 229,000-square-foot office building to include a school, health and wellness center, a center for youth programming, a casual dining restaurant, as well as construction of up to seven retail stores at an estimated cost of $26 million.

“The church is committed to working toward reducing unemployment, crime and violence, raising resident morale, and providing hope to the community overall,” said Pastor Jenkins. “This donation is the first I have heard of in this community and one of many examples of God blessing our effort and dedication to serving Chicago.”

Pastor Jenkins thanked Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Mayor Richard Daley and Ald. Howard Brookins for their ongoing support. Next steps include identifying additional friends and partners as Fellowship’s successful fundraising efforts continue, as well as identifying minority and women-owned subcontractors, compatible business enterprises and tenants to anchor the site and serve the community.

In addition, several individuals took exception to the press release as they felt it was disrespectful to the legacy of Mr &amp; Mrs. George Johnson who founded Johnson Products and cofounded Independence Bank. Soft Sheen was founded by Mr. Ed Gardner and was located at 1007 E. 87th St, Back in<a href="http://thesixthward.blogspot.com/2010/01/bridge-to-nowhere-who-proposed-this.html"> 2010</a>, former Alderman Fredrenna Lyle deemed the proposal the bridge to no where  as she stated she would not support it and if Alderman Brookins wanted it he could build it to the western side of the Red Line tracks that run in the middle of the Dan Ryan expressway.

As stated in the press release, the project has received support of several Chicago heavyweights that include former Mayor Richard Daley and Mellody Hobson, President of Ariel Investments Inc. Here are a couple of clips about the project

This taypayer supported bridge project appears to be coming as we have the Democratic candidate Pat Quinn in support of this project and the republican candidate Bruce Rauner , a staunch supporter of Charter Schools.

So just because the Governor and prospective candidates support this project should taxpayers have to pay for the infrastructure improvements that will be necessary and do you support the bridge?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Worlee";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7434:"Today, the Chicago Public Schools approved an application for Concept Schools, a charter school management company to open up a charter high school at 85th Lafayette.

“The church is committed to working toward reducing unemployment, crime and violence, raising resident morale, and providing hope to the community overall,” said Pastor Jenkins. “This donation is the first I have heard of in this community and one of many examples of God blessing our effort and dedication to serving Chicago.”

Pastor Jenkins thanked Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Mayor Richard Daley and Ald. Howard Brookins for their ongoing support. Next steps include identifying additional friends and partners as Fellowship’s successful fundraising efforts continue, as well as identifying minority and women-owned subcontractors, compatible business enterprises and tenants to anchor the site and serve the community.

In addition, several individuals took exception to the press release as they felt it was disrespectful to the legacy of Mr &amp; Mrs. George Johnson who founded Johnson Products and cofounded Independence Bank. Soft Sheen was founded by Mr. Ed Gardner and was located at 1007 E. 87th St, Back in<a href="http://thesixthward.blogspot.com/2010/01/bridge-to-nowhere-who-proposed-this.html"> 2010</a>, former Alderman Fredrenna Lyle deemed the proposal the bridge to no where  as she stated she would not support it and if Alderman Brookins wanted it he could build it to the western side of the Red Line tracks that run in the middle of the Dan Ryan expressway.

As stated in the press release, the project has received support of several Chicago heavyweights that include former Mayor Richard Daley and Mellody Hobson, President of Ariel Investments Inc. Here are a couple of clips about the project

This taypayer supported bridge project appears to be coming as we have the Democratic candidate Pat Quinn in support of this project and the republican candidate Bruce Rauner , a staunch supporter of Charter Schools.

So just because the Governor and prospective candidates support this project should taxpayers have to pay for the infrastructure improvements that will be necessary and do you support the bridge?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:113:"

After the post the City Colleges of Chicago dispatched one of their "Community Liasons" to seek me out and convince me that Kennedy King College(KKC) was moving in a positive direction. At that time they had recently hired a new president., <a href="http://www.ncc.edu/aboutncc/president_search/Biography_for_Dr_Joyce_Ester.pdf">Mrs. Joyce Ester, PHd</a>. She was an accomplished experienced junior college leader who came out of the State of California college system. I attended a presentation she gave where she expressed her vision for the school. The bottom line was she wanted to increase the graduation rate of approximately 20% and change the culture from glorified high school to an institution of higher education. Well that was short lived.

Recently <a title="DNA Info" href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20131219/englewood/kennedy-king-colleges-new-president-has-big-goals-for-school">DNAinfo</a> reported that the <a href="http://ccc.edu/programs/Pages/default.aspx">City Colleges of Chicago</a> had hired Mrs. Arshele Stevens who was the chief information officer for the Chicago Public Schools. She is the 4th president in 5 years at KKC. Based on the article she has no experience as an educator nor as a post secondary administrator. She appears to be a clueless political insider who has ties to the University of Chicago.

What is puzzling here is that there are a number of talented post secondary educators/administrators available locally and they could have gone to state's such as California, New York or Florida who have great junior college systems and have experience with a diverse student body. Also, if the goal was to hire an African American, with over 100 Historically Black Colleges and University's(HBCU) there is a pool of talent at these institutions that could have been tapped. Also, why there is a focus on Washburne which is a joke of a program where less than 50% of those who complete ever work in the restaurant industry and can't successfully operate the $750,000 restaurant that was built. Why isn't there a focus on what appears to be the most successful program KKC offers. The <a href="http://www.dot.il.gov/sbe/hcctp.html">Illinois Department of Transportation(IDOT) Highway Construction training program </a>is an intensive 12 week program that offers those who successfully complete a job with IDOT. Dawson Technical Institute, a division of KKC, that is located at 3901 S State Street in Bronzeville is one of  two locations in the county to offer this program.

This recent move leads me to wonder if this is a way to close Dawson which has been rumored to be on the sales block for sometime or is this another consulting project for the University of Chicago? The bottom line is that the squandering of taxpayers money on this glorified high school must stop.
