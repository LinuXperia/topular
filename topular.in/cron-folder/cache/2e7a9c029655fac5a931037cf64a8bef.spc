Indiana Packers, which is jointly-owned by Mitsubishi and Itoham Foods, Inc., is Carroll County's largest employer.<br /><br />Starting hourly wages at the meat packing plant are about $10.50 an hour according to the lawsuit. When the company's HR department received completed I-9 form from prospective employees to establish a worker's authorization to accept employment in the United States, the lawsuit alleges the company turned a blind eye towards the use of false documents by the new hires to pass a check on E-Verify, an online database the federal government offers employers to check the legal status of a prospective employee. "You’re required to use it in good faith," Chicago lawyer Howard Foster said of E-Verify. "If you believe that the documents relate to somebody else, you’re supposed to ask questions about the person, which they don’t do. They don’t ask any questions."<br /><br />The Star notes that Indiana Packers recently announced a $40.6 million expansion of its Delphi plant, which was expected to create an additional 91 jobs. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation offered Delph up to $475,000 in tax credits and $28,000 in training grants if it fulfills its hiring requirements. Gov. Mike Pence made that announcement with Mitsubishi and Indiana Packers officials in Tokyo last September.<br /><br />Under current Indiana law, employers face sanctions for employing undocumented aliens. The Indiana Department of Revenue is permitted to eliminate deductions employers take on their Indiana income tax returns for expenses related to the employment of undocumented aliens. In addition, employers can lose economic development incentives awarded to them if they are employing undocumented aliens. That law, however, foregoes sanctions against the employers if they rely on E-Verify to determine the legal status of their workers. That current law was sponsored by Sen. Mike Delph (R-Carmel), who tried unsuccessfully to enact legislation this year that would bar employers who employ undocumented aliens from doing business with the state. Although those sanction in SB 285 failed to pass, the Senate has approved a commission to study the impact undocumented workers have on Indiana's economy, which will be headed up by Sen. Delph.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/1475353233452795927/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:99:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2016/02/chicago-law-firm-files-rico-case.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1475353233452795927";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1475353233452795927";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:86:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2016/02/chicago-law-firm-files-rico-case.html";s:5:"title";s:111:"Chicago Law Firm Files RICO Case Against Indiana Packers For Suppressing Wages By Employing Undocumented Aliens";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

Mike Delph (R-Carmel) has introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2016/bills/senate/285" target="_blank">SB 285</a>&nbsp;in an effort to block some employers in Indiana which employ undocumented aliens from doing business within the state. I say some employers because the bill expressly exempts the following employers: public utilities; hospitals; nonprofit corporations; and ambulance providers. An employer may be barred from doing business in the state if it: (1) transacts business in Indiana; (2) has a license issued by an Indiana agency; and (3) employs one or more individuals who perform services in Indiana. So if you can operate a business without the need to obtain a license from the state, you are exempt from it as well.<br /><br />The enforcement provisions of this law make its constitutionality suspect. The U.S. Constitution empowers only Congress to regulate immigration, although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a similar Arizona law. Delph's legislation makes Indiana's attorney general responsible for enforcing the law based on complaints it receives. If the attorney general's investigation of a complaint determines an employer violated the law, he is required to notify the following: USCIS; local law enforcement agencies; and the prosecuting attorney's office. The legislation says the prosecuting attorney&nbsp;<i><b>may</b></i>&nbsp;bring a civil action requesting a hearing be conducted to determine if the employer broke the law. The permissive nature of this enforcement mechanism suggests to me that many prosecuting attorneys would elect against bringing enforcement actions, thereby creating a disparity across the state in prosecuting violations under the law.<br /><br />A court hearing an enforcement action that finds against an employer can: (1) order the employer to terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens; (2) place the employer on probation for a 3-year period during which it is required to file quarterly reports showing compliance with the order with the attorney general; and require the employer to sign a sworn affidavit within 30 days of the order stating it has complied with the order. If an employer is found to have violated the law a second chance, a court can place it on probation for a period of up to 10 years. Get caught a third time and the court can order the appropriate state agencies to revoke the employer's license or licences to conduct business in Indiana. Businesses that use E-Verify to verify their employees' status would be immune from prosecution under the law.<br /><br />The proposed law would clearly put Indiana law in conflict with current enforcement guidelines of federal agencies responsible for enforcement of immigration laws adopted by the Obama administration, which send very mixed signals to employers. Employers would run the risk of either complying with the state law or face the wrath of the federal government for discriminating against alien workers. Not surprisingly, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/07/bill-hire-undocumented-immigrants-lose-your-business-license/78432716/" target="_blank">tells the Indianapolis Star</a>&nbsp;it vehemently opposes the legislation. Indiana already has a law that permits the state to deny tax breaks to employers which employ undocumented aliens, although I'm unaware of any employers who have been sanctioned under that law.<br /><br />Speaking of immigration, I had the opportunity to view the oral argument in a case I previously discussed,&nbsp;<i>Escamilla v. Shiel Sexton Co</i>., a case involving an undocumented employee of a subcontractor working on one of the general contractor's work sites who sustained a permanent injury while on the job. As general contractor, Shiel Sexton assumed responsibility for all employee's safety who worked at the job site. It wants to offer evidence of Escamilla's immigration status to limit any potential recovery he might have for lost wages, assuming he is ever ordered removed to Mexico where his potential earning capacity would be much less than if he remained in the U.S. permanently. Escamilla's attorneys believe allowing the jury to hear his evidence of his immigration status would be prejudicial, and a public policy argument against rewarding employers who knowingly employ undocumented workers.<br /><br />Attorneys for Shiel Sexton indicated that Escamilla had provided only a Mexican driver's license and a social security number belonging to someone else when he started working for its subcontractor. The facts presented by Escamilla's attorney indicated a strong likelihood that he is on a path to legalized status. He was brought to this country when he was only 14 years old, is married to a U.S. citizen and has three U.S. citizen children. Escamilla's immigration attorney had presented evidence that his wife has filed to sponsor him for an immigration benefit. Escamilla had not yet obtained work authorization. The Obama administration has administratively permitted certain early childhood arrivals like Escamilla to obtain work authorization under a program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ("DACA"). It wasn't clear from the discussion whether Escamilla was eligible for that program, or whether he just didn't want to spend the money to pay the filing fee for work authorization.<br /><br />I was a bit confused by the evidence, which claimed his attorney had a pending I-485 adjustment of status petition on file for him. Based on these facts, Escamilla would not be eligible to file an I-485 and adjust status within the U.S.; rather, his wife could file an I-130 immigrant petition to sponsor him, and upon approval of that petition, he could file for a provisional hardship waiver on a Form I-601(A) that would permit him to apply to immigrate to this country, notwithstanding his unauthorized entry and period of stay in the U.S. Once his hardship waiver is approved, which is more than likely under these circumstance, he would be eligible to file an immigrant visa application (Form DS-260) for consular processing. Escamilla would be required to exit the country for his immigrant visa interview and then be allowed to re-enter the country lawfully as a permanent resident if his application is approved.<br /><br />It's difficult to predict how the Court of Appeals will rule. It didn't sound like either Judge May or Judge Bradford were very sympathetic to Escamilla's arguments. Judge Baker seemed more receptive to his attorney's arguments. If they don't rule in favor of Escamilla, there will be an anomaly in Indiana law where his immigration status for purposes of calculating the extent of his damages would be deemed prejudicial in a personal injury action and kept from the jury but not in a work-related injury case where the employer would seem to get its cake and eat it too.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/4079189923268291453/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:103:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2016/01/state-legislation-aimed-at-punishing.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/4079189923268291453";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/4079189923268291453";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:90:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2016/01/state-legislation-aimed-at-punishing.html";s:5:"title";s:75:"State Legislation Aimed At Punishing Employers Who Hire Undocumented Aliens";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

Carey's letter warns the states that their state plans cannot categorically deny ORR-funded benefits and services to refugees from Syria.

Lynch</a></i>, provided an interesting discussion of the legal status of children of U.S. soldiers born on military bases abroad. Jermaine Amani Thomas fought an immigration judge's determination that he was removable from the country based on three prior criminal convictions, claiming he acquired U.S. citizenship at birth under the 14th Amendment because his birth took place on a U.S. military hospital at a base in Germany. The 5th Circuit rejected his argument of birthright citizenship.<br /><br />Thomas' father immigrated to the United States in 1977 and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1979. In 1984, he became a naturalized citizen. Thomas' mother, a Kenyan citizen, gave birth to him at a military hospital in Frankfurt, Germany in 1986. Although his father was a U.S. citizen at the time, the immigration court found Thomas' father had not resided in the U.S. for the minimum 10-year residency period (current law requires 5-year minimum) required at the time of his birth under 8 U.S.C. 1401(g) to enable his son to acquire citizenship at birth under the statute, even after crediting his father's time spent abroad in the military. Nonetheless, Thomas argued the military base where he was born allowed him to claim birth within the U.S. under the 14th Amendment despite statutory language and Foreign Affairs Manual policies to the contrary.<br /><br />The 14th Amendment provides that "[a]ll persons born . . . in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," are citizens. The Court explained there are only two sources of citizenship: birth and naturalization.&nbsp;“Within the former category, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees that every person ‘born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, becomes at once a citizen of the United States, and needs no naturalization," the Court stated, quoting the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Wong Kim Ark</i>.&nbsp;“Persons not born in the United States acquire citizenship by birth only as provided by Acts of Congress.” The Court observed that if Thomas' father had satisfied the residency requirement set forth in 8 U.S.C. 1401(g), he would have acquired citizenship at birth by statute despite being born abroad and having one parent who was not a U.S. citizen.<br /><br />Whether birth on a military base abroad satisfied the 14th Amendment birthright citizenship was a case of first impression for the 5th Circuit. The Court cited other appellate court decisions which held that persons born in U.S. territories did not constitute birth in the U.S. for purposes of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. In each of those cases, the circuit court opinions relied on the Supreme Court's holding in the so-called <i>Insular Cases</i> where the Supreme Court distinguished between incorporated and unincorporated territories. Incorporated territories are those territories that were destined for statehood at the time of their acquisition as opposed to unincorporated territories like the Philippines once was that were not destined for statehood. While persons within the unincorporated territories are afforded "fundamental constitutional rights," birthright citizenship is not a right the inhabitants of such areas acquire because of their status.<br /><br />Thomas argued that the decision in <i>Wong Kim Ark</i> supported his contention he was within the United States for purposes of the 14th Amendment since Ark was born to Chinese nationals in San Francisco before California had been admitted to the Union as a state. The 5th Circuit found the case inapposite because the question of the territorial scope of the citizenship clause was not before the Supreme Court in <i>Wong Kim Ark</i>. &nbsp;The Court found that a military base abroad was in the nature of an unincorporated territory and declined to extend the citizenship clause's reach to Thomas despite his insistence that such a ruling effectively left him stateless. According to the facts of the case, Thomas had been admitted to the U.S. in 1989 on a visa that listed his nationality as Jamaican. It's unclear how he wound up there, but presumably his Kenyan mother, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, took him there to reside at some time following his birth without making any effort to naturalize him as a U.S. citizen.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/5171984447279176627/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:103:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2015/08/birth-on-military-base-does-not-make.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/5171984447279176627";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/5171984447279176627";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:90:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2015/08/birth-on-military-base-does-not-make.html";s:5:"title";s:64:"Birth On Military Base Does Not Make One A U.S. Citizen At Birth";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

An immigration judge ordered Mellouli deported under 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(B)(i), which authorizes the deportation (removal) of an alien “convicted of a violation of . . . any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21).” The sole “paraphernalia” Mellouli was charged with possessing was a sock in which he had placed four unidentified orange tablets. Mellouli admitted the pills contained in the sock were Adderall; however, the crime for which he was convicted was not tied to a specific type of substance. In a ruling today, the Supreme Court of the United States has reversed the immigration court's decision, holding that Mellouli’s Kansas conviction for concealing unnamed pills in his sock did not trigger removal under §1227(a)(2)(B)(i).<br /><br />The Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1034_3dq4.pdf"><i>Mellouli v. Lynch</i></a> applied the categorical approach in determining whether a state conviction renders an alien removable. The categorical approach looks to the statutory definition of the offense of the conviction, not to the particulars of the alien's conduct. The state conviction can only trigger removal if, by definition, the underlying crime falls within a category of removable offenses defined by federal law. Kansas' law defined "controlled substances" as any drug listed on its own schedules without reference to Section 802 of the federal law. Here, Mellouli was removable for the crime of using a sock to contain a controlled substance, not for possessing a substance controlled under Kansas law. No controlled substance as defined under section 802 figured as an element of the offense under which Mellouli was convicted. The Supreme Court interprets the federal law to limit the meaning of "controlled substance" for removal purposes to substances controlled under section 802. "Accordingly, to trigger removal under §1227(a)(2)(B)(i), the Government must connect an element of the alien’s conviction to a drug “defined in [§802]," the Court held.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/7131541613833890541/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:97:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2015/06/supreme-court-holds-that-state.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/7131541613833890541";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/7131541613833890541";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:84:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2015/06/supreme-court-holds-that-state.html";s:5:"title";s:89:"Supreme Court Holds That State Conviction For Drug Paraphernalia Is Not Removable Offense";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

Today, the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson announced the administration will halt implementation of those features of the executive action pending an appeal of the decision.<br /><br />The Department had intended to begin accepting applications this week for the expansion of Deferred Action for Early Childhood Arrivals ("DACA"). Two years ago, the administration authorized certain unlawful aliens who arrived in the U.S. prior to their 16th birthday to obtain deferred action status, which permitted them to obtain work authorization for an initial two-year period, subject to renewals for subsequent two-year periods. Under the President's executive action, the so-called DACA beneficiaries would become eligible for three-year work authorization periods instead of the initial two-year period. Current DACA beneficiaries may renew their authorization but only for two years instead of the three years planned under the expansion. In addition, those eligible for the original DACA program who have not yet filed for the benefit may still come forward and file for it.<br /><br />A second new deferred action category made work authorization available for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been continuously present in the country since January 1, 2010. The Department planned to begin accepting applications from so-called DAPA applicants within the next two to three months. The Department has halted those plans in light of the Texas court ruling for as long as the Court's order remains in effect.<br /><br />The Department's plans for prioritizing enforcement actions is not affected by the court's ruling. Under the announced priorities for enforcement policies concerning apprehension, detention and removal, the emphasis focuses on those unlawful aliens who have been convicted of more serious crimes, suspected terrorists, gang members and persons apprehended at the border. Persons with multiple or serious misdemeanors and the most recent border crossers receive secondary priority for removal, while least priority is given to those who failed to leave under a prior removal order or returned after a prior removal order.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/1789622651010146708/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:103:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2015/02/federal-district-court-judge-enjoins.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1789622651010146708";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1789622651010146708";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:90:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2015/02/federal-district-court-judge-enjoins.html";s:5:"title";s:105:"Federal District Court Judge Enjoins Enforcement Of Executive Action Implementing DAPA And Expanding DACA";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

The Department of State is required to make a determination that a person's citizenship was voluntarily relinquished. There is a presumption against expatriation for persons who became a naturalized citizen of another country, takes a routine oath of allegiance or accepts non-policy level employment with a foreign government. That presumption doesn't apply to a person who formally renounced his or her citizenship before a consular official, takes a policy level position in a foreign government, is convicted of treason, or performs expatriating acts accompanied by conduct which is inconsistent with retention of U.S. citizenship that it compels a conclusion the person intended to relinquish his or her U.S. citizenship.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Taxes are a primary reason behind a citizen's decision to expatriate. The Foreign Tax Compliance Act requires foreign banks to identify to U.S. taxing authorities any Americans with deposits of more than $50,000. The Act is intended to crack down on citizens who park money in overseas bank accounts to avoid taxation by the IRS. The Department of Treasury publishes a list of persons who have expatriated on a quarterly basis.

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the Board of Immigration Appeals, which had issued its own free-standing opinion in the case of <i><a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2014/D12-22/C:13-2470:J:Williams:aut:T:fnOp:N:1473750:S:0">Pedro Cano-Oyarzabal v. Holder</a></i>. The Court noted the state statute required a person convicted under the statute to "knowingly" flee or elude the police after receiving an officer's signal to stop. "Knowingly fleeing or attempting to elude an officer is an act wrong in itself and therefore a crime involving moral turpitude," the Court held.<br /><br />The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that an alien convicted of a “crime involving moral turpitude” is inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). A conviction for such a crime also makes one ineligible for cancellation of removal, subject to some exceptions. 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(C). There are exceptions if: (1) the alien was under the age of 18 at the time the crime, and the crime was committed and the alien released from prison or confinement at least five years prior to the date for application for admission to the United States; or the maximum penalty for the crime of which the alien was convicted did not exceed imprisonment for one year and the alien was not sentenced to a term in excess of six months.<br /><br />In deciding whether a conviction under a criminal statute is categorically one involving moral turpitude, it must be determined whether the government in question would apply its criminal<br />statute to reach both turpitudinous and non-turpitudinous acts. Because the statute in question only involved turpitudinous acts, the Court was not required to look at the record of the underlying conviction to determine whether the alien's conviction involved one of moral turpitude and, accordingly, afforded deference to the agency's administrative decision.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/945873895183464813/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:105:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/12/seventh-circuit-denies-review-of-moral.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/945873895183464813";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/945873895183464813";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:92:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/12/seventh-circuit-denies-review-of-moral.html";s:5:"title";s:118:"Seventh Circuit Denies Review Of Moral Turpitude Finding In Removal Proceeding On State Conviction For Eluding Police ";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

The President's executive actions, while welcomed by advocates of immigration reform, are drawing sharp reaction from many members of Congress and state and local officials. Opponents of his action are already threatening legal action to overturn the proposed changes on the basis that he is exceeding his executive powers. Indiana's Gov. Mike Pence was highly critical of the President's announcement. He called it an "unacceptable end run around the democratic process." "The State of Indiana will carefully evaluate the details of the Executive Order and take any available legal actions necessary to restore the rule of law and proper balance to our constitutional system of government," Gov. Pence said.<br /><br />Here is an overview of what the President's executive action will mean assuming the President is legally allowed to go forward his plans.<br /><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><br /></div><br /><u>Deferred Action For 4.4 Million Undocumented Aliens</u><br />Previously, President Obama by executive action enacted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ("DACA")&nbsp;which allowed undocumented aliens under the age of 31 as of June &nbsp;15, 2012 who arrived in the country prior to their 16th birthday and had continuously resided in the U.S. for at least five years to apply for a deferred action benefit, which allowed eligible beneficiaries to remain in the country for a 2-year period with opportunity for extensions and to obtain authorization to work. The President's executive action will eliminate the age cap and extend DACA coverage from those arriving prior to June 15, 2007 to include those arriving on or before June 15, 2010. Previously, only persons under the age of 31 were eligible for deferred action. Now anyone who entered the U.S. prior to their 16th birthday is eligible. A person granted the DACA benefit under the new program will be afforded the benefit for a 3-year period, subject to renewal. This part of the expanded DACA benefit is expected to be up and running within 90 days.<br /><br />The second and most profound change in the deferred action benefit is the expanded coverage the President intends to offer to an estimated 4.4 million undocumented aliens who are parents of U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident children who have been continuously present in the country since January 1, 2010. If individuals in this so-called DAP category pass background checks and pay back taxes, they will be eligible for deferred action with work authorization for a period of 3-years subject to renewal just like DACA beneficiaries. This new deferred action category is expected to be up and running within 180 days.<br /><br /><u>I-601A Waiver Expansion</u><br />The I-601A conditional waiver program, which allows undocumented aliens applying for a family immigration benefit for an immediate relative to apply for the hardship waiver prior to departing the country for an immigrant visa interview at a consulate abroad, will be expanded to include spouses and children of lawful permanent residents. The President's action will also clarify and expand the definition what qualifies as an "extreme hardship."<br /><br /><u>Enforcement Priorities</u><br />Existing ICE memos regarding enforcement priorities and prosecutorial discretion are to be replaced with a priority on the following categories of immigrants: (1) suspected terrorists, convicted felons, convicted gang members and persons apprehended on the border; (2) persons convicted of multiple or serious misdemeanors and very recent border crossers (those entering after January 1, 2014; and (3) Those who, after January 1, 2014, failed to leave under a removal order or returned after removal. The revised memo will contain strong language on the use of prosecutorial discretion.<br /><br /><u>Employer-based Adjustment of Status</u><br />Individuals with an approved employment-based immigrant petition who are caught in the quota backlog for adjustment of status will be advanced to permit them to obtain the benefit of a pending adjustment. This change will affect about 410,000 petitions.<br /><br /><u>Business Immigration Changes</u><br />Changes are being proposed that are billed as improvements in business immigration such as those offered to investors or national interest waivers could be made available to entrepreneurs, inventors, researchers and founders. The length of optional practical training ("OPT") for STEM graduates is expected to be expanded.<br /><br /><u>Parole-in-Place</u><br />Parole-in-place will be expanded to include families of individuals trying to enlist in the armed forces.<br /><br /><u>Visa Modernization</u><br />Efforts will be made to modernize the current visa system.

Under the so-called stop-time rule, continuous residence is deemed to end when an alien has been served a Notice to Appear under 8 U.S.C. 1229. In <i><a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2014/D07-16/C:14-1176:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:1381608:S:0">Wang v. Holder</a></i>, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals recently decided what form a Notice to Appear must take in order to trigger the stop-time rule.<br /><br />Yi Di Wang was a Chinese national who was smuggled into the United States in 1999 through the Virgin Islands. Immigration authorities discovered Wang within two days of his arrival and took him into custody. He was personally served with a Notice to Appear and ordered to appear at a date and time to be later determined at the immigration court in New Orleans. While Wang was in custody in New Orleans, he was released on bond. He was later served two notices for subsequent hearings but failed to appear. The immigration court closed the case on the motion of the government. Wang remained in the U.S. continuously for a period of at least 10 years after his initial release and married a Chinese citizen in 2009 with whom he had two children. Wang voluntarily returned to the immigration court in 2010 wherein he announced he was an applicant for a U visa as a victim of human trafficking. The immigration judge granted continuances while the U visa was being adjudicated, but declined to grant any further continuances in 2012 after his U visa had been turned down.<br /><br />Wang then sought cancellation of removal, but the immigration judge denied his petition, holding that the stop-time rule had been triggered when he was personally served a Notice to Appear two days after he entered the country without admission. Wang argued that the Notice to Appear did not include a date and time for his hearing as required under 8 U.S.C. 1229(a). The Board of Immigration Appeals denied Wang's appeal, holding that the stop-time rule only required receipt of a Notice to Appear to be triggered regardless of whether such notice included the time and date of hearing.<br /><br />The 7th Circuit affirmed the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision. Applying the two-part <i>Chevron</i> test, the Court concluded that Congress had not addressed the precise question in the statute and left it to the administrative agency to fill in the gaps. It next applied the second part of the <i>Chevron </i>test to determine if the Board's construction of the statute was a permissible construction. Although the Court agreed that the best way to fill the gap might have been as Wang argued to require a Notice to Appear to comply with every detail of 1229(a) to trigger the stop-time rule, it afforded deference to the Board's conclusion that the stop-time rule only required the type of notice and not the specific content of the notice as a permissible construction of the statute.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/3769059764719658064/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:104:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/07/cancellation-of-removal-and-operation.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/3769059764719658064";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/3769059764719658064";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:91:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/07/cancellation-of-removal-and-operation.html";s:5:"title";s:63:"Cancellation Of Removal And The Operation Of The Stop-Time Rule";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

Get a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude on your record or admit to committing acts that constitute the essential elements of&nbsp;a crime of moral turpitude, and the door slams shut. But what is a crime of moral turpitude?&nbsp;Like many&nbsp;terms in the Immigration&nbsp;&amp; Naturalization Act, it's not defined. The Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals defines the term to mean "conduct that shocks the public conscience as being 'inherently base, vile, or deprave, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general." That's quite a mouthfull, but a recent 7th Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em><a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2014/D07-09/C:13-2653:J:Flaum:aut:T:fnOp:N:1377385:S:0">Sanchez v. Holder</a></em> helps shed some light on its intricacies and the fact that a mere conviction&nbsp;under a criminal statute touching on&nbsp;moral turpitude alone doesn't always answer the question.<br /><br />The case involved Fredy Arnoldo Sanchez, a 47-year old citizen of El Salvador who unlawfully entered the U.S. in 1987. Sanchez, who resides in Indianapolis,&nbsp;is&nbsp;married to a lawful permanent resident and has four children, all of whom&nbsp;are U.S. citizens. For reasons that are unclear, Sanchez' case languished in removal proceedings for many years after his&nbsp;initial asylum claim proved unsuccessful. At&nbsp;an initial appearance before an immigration judge in 2006, he conceded&nbsp;the government's&nbsp;contention that he was removable from the country.&nbsp;At his next hearing in 2007, Sanchez&nbsp;renewed&nbsp;his petition for cancellation of removal based on hardship to his U.S. citizen&nbsp;children, as well as the special rule for cancellation under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act ("NACARA"). The government contended he wasn't eligible for NACARA relief because of acts he&nbsp;allegedly committed as&nbsp;a soldier in the El Salvadoran&nbsp;military. Sanchez was granted more time to respond to the government's allegations.<br /><br />A new issue arose when Sanchez appeared at his next hearing in 2009.&nbsp;Since his last hearing, Sanchez had been arrested for leaving&nbsp;the scene of an accident where serious bodily injury occurred, a Class D felony under I.C. 9-26-1-8. Upon hearing the information for the first time, the government argued the crime with which Sanchez had been charged involved a crime of moral turpitude, rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal. Sanchez was offered&nbsp;an alternative sentencing plea agreement under which he pleaded guilty to the felony&nbsp;charge but was sentenced as committing a Class A misdemeanor charge. He received a sentence of 365 days with 363 days suspended and one year of probation. The Court described a personal affidavit Sanchez submitted to the sentencing court describing his crime as follows:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: small;">Sanchez was driving at night on a road without any lights, that it was raining heavily, and that there was a lot of fog. He "heard a noise, which was an impact on [his] car." Unsure whether he could stop safely in traffic, and believing that he had merely hit "a post or a small object," Sanchez continued driving. The affidavit states that he only became aware that he had hit a person when police officers arrived at his residence the next day and told him. </span></blockquote><span style="font-size: small;"></span>Upon reviewing the facts, the immigration law judge hearing Sanchez' case concluded that he committed a crime of moral turpitude, was ineligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed to El Salvador. Sanchez appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which affirmed the immigration law judge's ruling. Sanchez appealed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals which held that the Board had failed to follow the required analytical examination required to determine that Sanchez' crime indeed involved a crime of moral turpitude. The Court went on to describe a 3-part examination courts have determined is necessary for ascertaining that fact based on <em>Matter of Silva-Trevino.</em><br /><em></em><br />The first part of the test requires the adjudicator to determine whether there is any realistic possibility that the statute under which a person has been convicted could be based on conduct not involving a crime of moral turpitude. If it is determined that the statute covers both turpitudinous and non-turpitudinous conduct, then the adjudicator moves to step two. At that stage, the adjudicator must ascertain whether the conduct with which the person's criminal conviction was based involved turpitudinous conduct from the criminal court records. If the criminal court records are insufficient to answer the question, then the adjudicator&nbsp;is required to move to a third step and conduct a further inquiry to more accurately make a determination. The burden rests on the moving party to prove his crime involved non-turpitudinous conduct. Because the Court found that the Board of Immigration Appeals had only mentioned the <em>Silva-Trevino</em>&nbsp;analysis in passing without actually employing it, the Court&nbsp;vacated its order and remanded&nbsp;it back&nbsp;for re-adjudication.&nbsp;The Court further noted that a person could be found guilty under I.C.&nbsp;9-26-28-1&nbsp;for crimes other than hit-and-run, allowing Sanchez to make it past the first part of the <em>Silva-Trevino</em> analysis. The Court noted the&nbsp;possibility that Sanchez' appeal still might fail in the event the evidence in the court record is inconclusive with the burden falling on him to prove otherwise, but the Board can't simply&nbsp;end the inquiry early until he's been given the opportunity to prove otherwise.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/6097054368688282428/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:102:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/07/another-case-demonstrates-roadblock.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/6097054368688282428";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/6097054368688282428";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:89:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/07/another-case-demonstrates-roadblock.html";s:5:"title";s:117:"Another Case Demonstrates Roadblock Convictions For Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude Pose For Cancellation Of Removal";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

In addition to satisfying the 10 years of continuous residence in the United States, an alien must also be able to demonstrate that he/she is a person of good moral character. A recent 7th Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em><a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2014/D07-03/C:13-2536:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1374743:S:0">Ortiz-Estrada v. Holder</a></em> is a painful reminder of the consequences of flunking that latter requirement. <br /><br />The petitioner in this case was 20 years old when he entered the United States from Mexico unlawfully. He is married and has five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. When Ortiz-Estrada was placed in removal proceedings in 2010, the Court notes that he had already "accumulated an impressive string of sanctions for a variety of traffic offenses" committed during the prior 10-year period. In addition to numerous citations for driving without a valid driver's license and driving on a revoked driver's license, among other things,&nbsp;Ortiz-Estrada had also been arrested three times for driving while under the influence of alcohol. <br /><br />In 2011, while his removal proceedings were still underway, he was arrested yet again and charged with numerous traffic offenses, including "aggravated driving under the influence." Ortiz-Estrada's attorney kept requesting continuances in his latest traffic arrest, hoping to get the charges dismissed or avoid a conviction before a ruling by the immigration judge on his petition for cancellation of removal. The immigration judge lost patience and denied a further continuance requested by his attorney in deciding&nbsp;his petition for cancellation of removal, citing lack of good moral character based on his past criminal record and ordered him removed from the country. <br /><br />The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed Ortiz-Estrada's order of removal; however, the Court of Appeals found that the immigration judge improperly stated prior 7th Circuit cases as standing for the proposition that "an individual with a record like yours lacks good moral character to qualify for residence through cancellation of removal." The Court noted that the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act does not define "good moral character," thus a decision whether an alien has such character "is in an exercise of administrative discretion that a court cannot review." The Court then considered whether the immigration court judge had been allowed "a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf" after refusing to grant additional time until&nbsp;Ortiz-Estrada's criminal case was&nbsp;decided.&nbsp;The person challenging an unfavorable decision&nbsp;is required not&nbsp;only to demonstrate that his reasonable opportunity was denied, but also that he was prejudiced the Court observed. <br /><br />The attorney for Ortiz-Estrada argued that the immigration judge did not give proper consideration to the fact that none of his prior arrests resulted in any felony convictions or the possibility the charges in the pending felony case against him might be dismissed. The Court found his attorney's arguments immaterial and unpersuasive, noting that the attorney had the opportunity to make the same arguments to the judge who heard the case, and that his decision was based on his prior criminal history, not the pending criminal case against him. The Court concluded that both the immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals had sufficient evidence to conclude that Ortiz-Estrada lacked good moral character. Accordingly, the Court found that the immigration judge's refusal to grant a continuance before reaching his decision did not prejudice Ortiz-Estrada. "The lawyer’s procedural argument amounts to a contention that as long as his client goes on violating the traffic laws, he can’t be removed—for even though his record gets worse and worse, there will always be some pending charges that the immigration judge must wait to see resolved before deciding whether to order him removed,"&nbsp;the Court said.&nbsp;"Not a good argument."<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/4350208840650846453/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:101:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/07/recent-case-demontrates-good-moral.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/4350208840650846453";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/4350208840650846453";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:88:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/07/recent-case-demontrates-good-moral.html";s:5:"title";s:84:"Recent Case Demontrates Good Moral Character Requirement For Cancellation Of Removal";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

Access Therapies, Inc. has also been ordered to pay $81,454 in civil penalties and nearly $40,000 in back wages to six physical therapists for violations of the H-1B rules, including failure to pay workers the prevailing wage rate for both&nbsp;productive and non-productive time. It's unclear why the Department's administrative law&nbsp;judge&nbsp;lowered the size of the penalties and the number of back wages that were awarded against Access Therapies back in 2010 by&nbsp;administrative action, which ordered the company to pay&nbsp;over $200,000 in penalties and more than $1 million owed in back wages to more than 60 H-1B employees. Here's the text of the Department's press release:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Under terms of a court order, Indianapolis-based Access Therapies Inc. must pay $81,454 in civil money penalties and $39,946 in back wages to six physical therapists for violations of the H-1B provisions of the <a href="http://webmail.indy.rr.com/do/redirect?url=http%253A%252F%252Fgo.usa.gov%252F8UBW&amp;hmac=0f5ca33d669c47450e97487d9e0be749" target="_blank"> Immigration and Nationality Act</a>.

Access Therapies will be debarred from participation in the H-1B program for a one-year period.<span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote><div class="MsoNormal"><blockquote class="tr_bq">“The rules governing the employment of nonimmigrant workers in specialty occupations are specific and must be followed completely. Failing to do so denies qualified workers an opportunity for meaningful employment in the American economy,” said Thomas Gauza, district director for the Wage and Hour Division in Chicago. “This case shows that the department will not hesitate to bring legal action against employers that continue to short their employees and violate the law.”&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote></div><div class="MsoNormal"><blockquote class="tr_bq">An investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division found, among other issues, that the company misrepresented facts on its application when petitioning for and employing H-1B nonimmigrant workers and, as a result, the division issued the company a determination letter seeking the back wages owed. Access Therapies contested those findings and requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, who issued the order that required the company to pay back wages, civil money penalties and interest, and debarred it from the H-1B program for a one-year period.<span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote></div><div class="MsoNormal"><blockquote class="tr_bq">The investigation found employees were due back wages because they were not compensated with the required prevailing wages for productive work time or for preassignment and post-assignment time, as required. Access Therapies failed to withhold applicable employment taxes, such as payments to Medicare, FICA and federal and state income tax. The company is required to pay such taxes, plus interest and penalties, to the appropriate taxing authorities.<span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></blockquote></div><div class="MsoNormal"><blockquote class="tr_bq">Under the terms of the order, in addition to paying the back wages and penalties, Access Therapies has agreed to enhanced compliance procedures, including records review by the department for a two-year period, and agrees to comply with provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act in the future.</blockquote><br />As a word of caution to H-1B employees, the press release makes no mention of an affiliated company owned by the same two owners and operated&nbsp;by the same employees out of the offices where Access Therapies conducts business. That business is RN Staff,&nbsp;Inc. According to recent H-1B data, both Access Therapies and RN Staff&nbsp;are among the top ten&nbsp;companies in the state of Indiana employing H-1B workers. <br /><br />I have represented in the past multiple employees who have been sued by Access Therapies and RN Staff, Inc.&nbsp;for allegedly breaching their employment contact with the companies. These companies have filed more than six dozen lawsuits against former employees seeking damages of $20,000 or more, plus attorney's fees, after employees became disillusioned and left their employment, often because they believed that they were not provided a full-time job at the wages they believed they were promised when they entered into a contract with the staffing companies. I have complained endlessly to the&nbsp;U.S. Department of Labor about their slow progress in prosecuting&nbsp;pending cases against Access Therapies. While I'm pleased to see the Department has finally acted, for too many harmed&nbsp;H-1B employees, it's too little too late. The company can simply skirt the one-year bar by using its affiliated company, RN Staff, Inc., to file new H-1B applications, effectively making the one-year bar meaningless. For dozens of other harmed workers, this order provides no relief.<br /><br />If you don't listen to anything else I write, please listen to this. Never sign a contract to be employed as an H-1B employee in the United States without first obtaining advice from an attorney. Many H-1B employers don't require their employees to sign&nbsp;a written contract. A written employment contract can be&nbsp;a very good thing for an employee, but making sure the terms contained within the contract protect you as much as they protect the employer is essential. If you are asked to start off in an employment situation where it looks like you're paying off a large debt to the employer for the privilege of employment, you need to seriously reconsider your options. <br /><br />UPDATE: WRTV's Kara Kenney, who has been the only local news reporter who has covered the issues with this problem staffing company, has a good story in follow up to her original investigative report, which you can view by clicking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/121k-penalties-issued-against-indy-staffing-co">here</a>. </div><div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/1748460265684706820/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:106:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/06/access-therapies-barred-from-hiring-new.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1748460265684706820";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1748460265684706820";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:93:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/06/access-therapies-barred-from-hiring-new.html";s:5:"title";s:65:"Access Therapies Barred From Hiring New H-1B Workers For One Year";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

Papatheodoropoulos arrived at the Indianapolis International Airport in June, 2012 and was cleared through inspection with an intent of staying in the U.S.&nbsp;until October, 2012. He brought along with him a laptop and hard drives for a computer server to aid him in conducting business during his trip. The computer server to which the hard drives belonged was shipped after his arrival. <br /><br />When the other items, including the computer server, arrived at the airport, Dr. Von Der Haar and Papatheodoropoulos returned to the airport to pick them up&nbsp;and were directed to the local Customs and Border Patrol office near the airport. When they&nbsp;arrived at the office, they were perplexed&nbsp;when an agent&nbsp;questioned them about whether they had intentions of getting married&nbsp;during&nbsp;Papatheodoropoulos' visit. Agents called Papatheodoropoulos back for questioning while Von Der Haar waited in the waiting area of the office.&nbsp;Before they concluded their questioning of Papatheodoropoulos,&nbsp;they asked to speak to Von Der Haar.<br /><br />According to the complaint, Von Der Haar was taken to an enclosed office with two uniformed agents present who appeared to her to be armed. They began asking her questions about the nature of her relationship with Papatheodoropoulos and&nbsp;e-mails that she had exchanged with him. The agents asked her if she was having sex with Papatheodoropoulos. At one point, one of the agents acknowledged that they had read e-mail exchanges the two had sent to one another. She was also asked questions about why Papatheodoropoulos had so many cell phones and whether he had brought any with him to the U.S. At no point during the interview was Von Der Haar advised that she had a right to leave or not answer the questions. After they concluded their questioning of her, she waited until&nbsp;Papatheodoropoulos was released about 4 1/2 to 5 hours later. <br /><br />Following the interview, Papatheodoropoulos was served with a notice that he was being removed from the United States because he had violated the terms of his visitor visa by entering with the intention of immigrating to the U.S. The complaint states that this allegation was untrue. After consulting with the Greek consulate and attorneys, Papatheodoropoulos departed the U.S. in August, 2012. The lawsuit contends that the agents' detention of Dr. Von Der Haar violated her Fourth Amendment Right to be free from&nbsp;unreasonable seizures carried out without probable cause or reasonable suspicion. <br /><br />Many civil rights advocates have been very vocal after learning of the extent to which the NSA has been monitoring private e-mail and cell phone communications of U.S. citizens. While the government has defended its actions, arguing that&nbsp;its bulk e-mail data collection did not include the content of those exchanges, this case seems to suggest otherwise. Based on this case, one should be cautious and assume that e-mail exchanges with your friends and acquaintances outside this country are being monitored by the government. <br /><br />Hat tip to <a href="http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2014/02/ind_courts_woma_3.html">Indiana Law Blog</a>. <br /><span style="font-family: Times-Roman;">&nbsp;</span><div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/573849618466422919/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:104:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/02/word-to-wise-government-is-monitoring.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/573849618466422919";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:81:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/573849618466422919";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:91:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2014/02/word-to-wise-government-is-monitoring.html";s:5:"title";s:80:"Word To The Wise: The Government Is Monitoring Your E-Mails And Cell Phone Calls";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

When a typical employer goes to the trouble of expending the time, money and resources required to employ alien workers, it acts out of a compelling need to fill jobs that it has been challenged to fill with qualified American workers. Staffing companies offering jobs to professional alien workers, however, are strictly driven by a profit motive of finding warm bodies they can employ to contract out to employers searching to fill jobs. The staffing companies earn their profits from the mark-up they charge to the end employers over their cost of employing the alien workers. The purpose of this article is to alert&nbsp;alien workers of the pitfalls in seeking jobs in the U.S. through a staffing company as opposed to direct employment with the employer who actually needs the valuable labor you have to offer them.<br /><br />There is a growing phenomenon of staffing companies in the U.S.&nbsp;springing up that almost exclusively target professional immigrant workers for employment. Some of these companies will literally turn away American workers seeking their assistance in job placement at the risk of violating laws protecting workers against discrimination based on their nationality&nbsp;due to their desire of employing immigrant workers because of the added leverage they have in dealing with their employees through their control of the employer-sponsored visa that allows the workers to work legally in the U.S. While this can occur in many categories of professional expertise, it appears that health care professionals are a common target, and physical and occupational therapists are the most popular subset within that category of workers for exploitation by staffing companies. <br /><br />How do staffing companies exploit foreign workers? The most common problem&nbsp;occurring in the U.S. is for a staffing company to lure an alien worker to enter into a contract&nbsp;in exchange for&nbsp;a promise of employment for a defined period of time at a fixed rate of pay. Recruiters working for the staffing company will entice alien workers to sign the contracts based upon a promise to sponsor and obtain a work-based visa, most typically an H-1B visa or a green card, at no cost to the employee for placement in a job that may or may not actually exist. In the case of&nbsp;H-1B visas, staffing companies will file labor condition applications and non-immigrant visa applications on behalf of the employee representing that a job exists for the sponsored alien worker at a work site where it currently contracts alien workers or has in the past. It's a&nbsp;crime for the employer to make false representations in&nbsp;labor condition and non-immigrant visa applications but enforcement of violators by the U.S. Department of Labor and Department of Homeland Security is so lax&nbsp;that it's a risk unscrupulous staffing companies are often willing to take. Staffing companies sometimes resort to this subterfuge in order to grab a piece of the limited number of work visas issued annually, assuming they will find a job for the alien workers the&nbsp;successfully recruit&nbsp;by the time the work visa is approved, if not soon thereafter.<br /><br />What&nbsp;staffing companies are&nbsp;often requiring&nbsp;alien&nbsp;applicants to do as a condition to sponsoring them&nbsp;for a work-based visa is to&nbsp;include as part of their contractual&nbsp;obligation a requirement to pay to the staffing company as liquidated damages a fixed sum of money in the event the worker fails to remain employed with the staffing company for&nbsp;the minimum period of time specified in the contract, which is typically two to three years. These liquidated damage clauses can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. In addition,&nbsp;some staffing companies will require their alien employees to sign a promissory note agreeing to repay the amount of liquidated damages specified in the contract in full&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;the employee leaves&nbsp;his or her employment before&nbsp;exhausting the minimum&nbsp;period of employment. What this means is that you begin your new employment with the staffing company owing a fixed amount of debt to your employer that you will have to repay at some point if you fail to work it off by remaining employed with the staffing company for the minimum required period. It's akin to a modern-day form of indentured servitude, which was long ago outlawed in this country.<br /><br />What happens if you don't pay up after leaving your job? If the employee fails to pay&nbsp;up, the staffing company will sue the employee in&nbsp;the forum where&nbsp;the company is based under a forum selection clause contained&nbsp;in the employee's contract that is often inconvenient for the employee, who may be residing in an entirely different state or country at the time the lawsuit is&nbsp;commenced.&nbsp;Employees who fail to defend the lawsuits, which occurs quite frequently after they relocate and their whereabouts are unknown to their former employer to serve them notice of the lawsuit, wind up with&nbsp;default judgments entered against them&nbsp;which becomes a cloud on their credit record and the unpaid note continues to accrue interest at the rate specified in the promissory note instrument.&nbsp;Satisfaction of the judgment may&nbsp;include the&nbsp;garnishment of&nbsp;the employee's wages at their new place of employment through the filing of a proceeding supplemental by the employer.<br /><br />Employees who are sued for breaking their contract may have defenses and counterclaims to their employer's claim against them. As a matter of contract law, if one party first breaches the contract materially, the employee can raise that as an affirmative defense which can act to bar recovery by the employer against the employee for subsequently breaching the contract by terminating the contract early, for example.&nbsp;An employee could argue the employer materially breached the contract&nbsp;by failing to pay the wages promised under the terms of the contract. Under Indiana law, an employer can be held liable to the employee under the wage payment statute if it fails to pay all of the wages due to the employee. The wage payment statute permits the employee to recover treble damages, plus attorney's fees, if the employee can prove the employee failed to pay any wages due to the employee.<br /><br />You might ask why an alien worker who obtains employment in the U.S. through the services of a staffing company would want to leave his or her job knowing the risk of being sued and having to pay serious sums of money to their former employer? There are several reasons. Sometimes, alien workers arrive in the U.S. after obtaining their work visa only to learn that the job they were promised by the staffing company when they signed the contract no longer exists. Employers who directly employ non-immigrant workers will terminate the employee's employment and pay for their return travel back home if they are unable to employ the worker in the job they intended to employ the worker. The law requires them to do so. A staffing company will be out the time, money and expense it invested to bring you to work in the U.S. on a work visa if it sends you back home at its expense. Rather than send you home, it will insist that you stay put until it finds another job opening for you. The staffing company will entice you to stay by agreeing to cover your housing expenses at an employer-furnished apartment or house that you may or may not find suitable for your living expectations.<br /><br />If a staffing company insists that you remain in the U.S. while it finds another job for you, it is legally required to pay you the prevailing wage rate&nbsp;it represented to the Department of Labor and USCIS that it intended to pay you once you&nbsp;become employed&nbsp;under your work-based visa as if you were working full-time. Unfortunately, unscrupulous staffing companies may refuse to pay you for the time you are benched while waiting for a job assignment, or they may offer you only part-time work assignments, which deprives you of the benefit of the full-time job the employer represented to you when you entered into&nbsp;a contract of employment, and which it represented to the government you would have once&nbsp;you&nbsp;started work under your work-based visa. If the staffing company benches you without pay, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor. Unfortunately, prosecuting these complaints has not been a high priority of the Department and complaints&nbsp;sometimes linger for years before being acted upon.<br /><br />Even alien workers employed by staffing companies that pay them regularly the wages due to them regardless of their work status can become frustrated if their employment requires frequent job changes that require the employee to physically relocate their residence every few months. Staffing companies may only be able to obtain short-term assignments for you at particular work sites. Your contract will typically require you to relocate&nbsp;your job location at the employer's discretion. Even with a housing allowance to offset the hassle of frequent job relocations, it is not unusual for the employee to grow weary and demoralized from packing up and moving just as&nbsp;the employee&nbsp;begins to get settled in and becomes comfortable working at a job site. Adding to the frustration may be disputes between the staffing company and the employer to whom you are contracted over the amount of hours that you are working and for which the employer is being billed. This conflict often results in wage underpayment disputes between you and the staffing company that can further fracture your relationship with the staffing company. <br /><br />How can the alien worker avoid the foregoing scenarios from playing out? I would advise any alien working seeking work in the U.S. on an employment-based visa to&nbsp;look for employment opportunities&nbsp;that provide direct employment with an employer rather than an indirect employment arrangement through a staffing company. If you are unsuccessful in finding employment through the direct approach, then follow some simple rules to avoid being exploited by a staffing company. <br /><ul><li>Never sign a contract with a staffing company before performing some basic independent research on the Internet about the company. You might be surprised by the amount of information former workers share about their experience working with specific employers. You can also search the U.S. Department of Labor's website database to determine if there are pending or adjudicated complaints against the prospective employer.</li><li>When discussing potential employment with a recruiter at&nbsp;a staffing company, treat the process as an interview of your potential employer as much as the recruiter should be treating your hiring as a serious interview&nbsp;process.&nbsp;The&nbsp;distance between you and the staffing company often makes in-person interviews impossible but video conference calling can close that distance. If the recruiter asks you&nbsp;to sign a contract without first conducting a serious interview&nbsp;with you as a job candidate and obtaining&nbsp;your biographical, educational credentials and pertinent work history, then you should question the professionalism of the staffing company. &nbsp;</li><li>If at all possible, please take the time to retain the services of an attorney to review&nbsp;any contract&nbsp;presented to&nbsp;you and to advise you on the benefits and consequence of entering into a written contract. Keep in mind that if the employer is planning to employ you as a non-immigrant worker, then by the very terms of your work visa, you are only a&nbsp;temporary&nbsp;worker&nbsp;allowed to legally work in the U.S. during the authorized period of time and upon the terms provided in your work visa. If your employment terminates for any reason,&nbsp;so does&nbsp;your work authorization.&nbsp;Employers who directly employ&nbsp;non-immigrant workers&nbsp;often avoid written contracts that act to&nbsp;convert what is otherwise an at-will employment&nbsp;agreement to a legally-enforceable&nbsp;agreement for a specific term of employment for that very reason.&nbsp;Staffing companies choose to use written contracts as a club to compel performance by workers they sponsor for temporary work visas and green cards.</li><li>Never sign a contract&nbsp;with a staffing company that does not specifically identify the nature of employment you are agreeing to accept, including&nbsp;a specific location of the proposed employment,&nbsp;the wages you will be paid and written assurance that the employment you are agreeing to accept is based on full-time employment&nbsp;that will commence as soon as your work visa is approved, or at least no later than 30 days thereafter, and that you will be paid wages based on the agreed wage amount for full-time employment, including any periods during which you are benched while&nbsp;awaiting a new assignment through no fault of your own or under-employed as a result of being assigned to jobs that require less hours than full-time employment. </li><li>Because the staffing company has to identify a specific employer, job site location and wage rate in the labor condition and non-immigrant visa applications it files on your behalf, ask the staffing company to state in writing up front that pertinent information. If the staffing company refuses to furnish you this information, it should serve as a warning to you that the job the staffing company says is available does not really exist. By law, the employer is required to provide a copy of the labor condition&nbsp;and non-immigrant visa applications to the employee on request. Always request them and retain them for your records.</li><li>Never sign a contract with a staffing company that does not include a covenant that requires the employer to abide by all laws and regulations governing the employment of non-immigrant workers and provides that violation of those laws and regulations constitute a breach of&nbsp;the contract by the employer.</li><li>Never sign a contract that includes an unreasonably high liquidated damages clause. Take into consideration the amount you expect to earn from the job once you are employed,&nbsp;the minimum&nbsp;length of time you are required to work for the staffing company to avoid the consequences of paying damages to your employer and the likelihood of your ability to pay the liquidated damages in&nbsp;the event you decide to terminate your employment early in determining the reasonableness of the liquidated damages sum. The liquidated damages clause should specify that it does not include the cost of filing fees, attorney's fees and other costs&nbsp;associated with obtaining your work-based visa.</li><li>Never sign a contract with a staffing company that does not include a provision that permits the prevailing party in any dispute that arises under the contract to be awarded their reasonable attorney's fees. Some staffing companies will draft contracts that only provide for an award of attorney's fees to the employer in the event it is required to take legal action against you to enforce the contract. Make sure that obligation is mutual.</li><li>You should always take the view that any contract the staffing company puts in front of you for signature is subject to negotiation. If the terms of the contract are one-sided and the staffing company says the terms are non-negotiable, you should take that as a warning sign of potential trouble down the road in your dealings with them. Always insist on receiving a fully-executed copy of the contract for your records. Some unscrupulous staffing companies have been known to furnish altered versions of the original contract to the employee when disputes arise later. </li><li>Retain for your records all communications you have with the staffing company and the employer to whom you are assigned to work, particularly all e-mail communications. If your employer typically communicates information to you over the telephone, document the substance of those conversations in a follow-up e-mail to your employer.

Windsor</em>, which for the first time made it possible for married, same-sex couples to receive the same immigration benefits that are afforded to opposite-sex couples. My office successfully handled the petition of Robert Malchow, a&nbsp;resident of Monon, Indiana&nbsp;and his husband, Anine Aouad, a native of Morocco, who were among the first cases&nbsp;adjudicated in the local Indianapolis office. The couple, who have been together since 2008,&nbsp;were married in Davenport, Iowa in 2011 after it became the third state in the country to legally recognize same-sex marriages. Congratulations to Robert and Anine! It's important for same-sex couples residing in Indiana to understand that even though Indiana does not legally recognize same-sex marriages, U.S. citizens who enter into a same-sex marriage in a state or country where their marriage is legally recognized can legally petition for immigrant benefits on behalf of their spouse.<div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/8195784645506211494/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:105:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2013/11/indianapolis-uscis-office-handling-its.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/8195784645506211494";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/8195784645506211494";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:92:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2013/11/indianapolis-uscis-office-handling-its.html";s:5:"title";s:68:"Indianapolis USCIS Office Handling Its First Same-Sex Marriage Cases";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.

He also provided fraudulent documents, claiming them as receipts for his work, documents say.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">He also accepted money intended to pay bonds for people being held by immigrations in Chicago. In another case, a woman paid him to intervene in her husband’s deportation. The man was deported and Lopez refused to refund the money.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Court documents say Lopez also received cash from an undercover officer to remove an immigration hold on someone who was being held in the Marion County Jail. That person was transported to another facility and never received the bond money.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Lopez also identified himself as a pastor at Iglesia De Cristo Nuevo. He used a bank account in the organization’s name to deposit funds from the victims. The church was also where he collected money from the victims.</blockquote>Hispanic immigrants often fall victims to persons not authorized to practice law by confusing someone who is licensed to only act as a notary public&nbsp;with a notario publico.

Windsor striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. A U.S. citizen living in Florida who married a Bulgarian student in New York where same-sex marriages are legal received notice of the approval of his alien spouse's green card just days after the Supreme Court's decision. The&nbsp;approved green&nbsp;card&nbsp;was among a number of green card applications filed by the spouse of a U.S. citizen married to a person of the same-sex that had been denied in the past. USCIS has maintained a list of same-sex petitions turned down over the past two years, which are now being reversed. Newly-filed petitions for same-sex couples will be processed in the same manner as those filed by opposite-sex couples. <br /><br />Although Indiana does not recognize same-sex marriages, a U.S. citizen residing in Indiana who marries a person of the same-sex in a country or state where same-sex marriages are legally recognized is eligible to sponsor his alien spouse for immigration. That's because U.S. immigration law looks to the jurisdiction where the marriage was entered into, not the residence of the married couple, to determine whether it was lawfully entered into. What is less clear is how same-sex couples in Indiana will be treated for federal tax purposes. It's clear that same-sex couples residing in states which recognize their marriages are entitled to the same tax benefits as afforded to opposite-sex couples under current law. It's less clear how same-sex couples will be treated in states like Indiana which do not recognize such marriages. <div class="blogger-post-footer">indiana, immigration, attorney, indianapolis, naturalization, citizenship, law, indiana immigration law blog, immigration attorney</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:83:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/feeds/1086453357037446489/comments/default";s:5:"title";s:13:"Post Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:7:"replies";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:102:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2013/07/first-reported-approval-of-same-sex.html#comment-form";s:5:"title";s:10:"0 Comments";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"edit";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1086453357037446489";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:20:"application/atom+xml";s:4:"href";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7086160883826388617/posts/default/1086453357037446489";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:3:"rel";s:9:"alternate";s:4:"type";s:9:"text/html";s:4:"href";s:89:"http://www.indianaimmigrationlawblog.com/2013/07/first-reported-approval-of-same-sex.html";s:5:"title";s:61:"First Reported Approval Of Same-Sex Marriage-Based Green Card";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:3:{s:4:"name";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Gary R.
