Instead, I prefer making trend predictions that I can try at my leisure when the new year rolls around. If you’re up for taking my pressure free resolution route then join in for a breakdown of the makeup trends we’ll be on the look out for in 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bright lips</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://thecitizensoffashion.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/new-york-fashion-week-ss-2014-beauty-trend-report-1.jpg?w=800" width="386" height="498" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bold look-at-me lips will be sticking around for 2014. Looking to the runways of Altuzarra and DKNY for inspiration, we can count on matte fire engine red and tangerine inspired shades as being a continued must have. Before you start perfecting your bold pout, <a title="The Best Lipstick Shades For Your Skin Tone" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/05/the-best-lipstick-shades-for-your-skin-tone/">find out which statement hue will work best for you skin tone</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The eyes have it</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We can look forward to playing up the eyelids to reinvent our makeup looks. Experiment with vibrant eyeshadows, bold eyeliner, shimmer and sheer washes of color to make your eyes a gorge focal point. Let’s take a closer look at a few game changing eye makeup trends:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter" alt=" Marc by Marc Jacobs" src="http://thecitizensoffashion.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/new-york-fashion-week-ss-2014-beauty-trend-report-9.jpg?w=800" /></p>
<p> Bright eyes: When it comes to eyeshadow, the theme for the 2014 is the more vivid, the better. To get the look, reach for highly pigmented shades (beautiful blues and greens were popular at the spring fashion shows) for that just right pop of color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/600x600/public/whiteeyes-700_0.jpg?itok=F9F6HwIa" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">White eyes: Lids accented with white were teaming all over the runways. White eyeliner is for sure in the running to be a spring beauty fixture. Soft pearly whites take on an ethereal quality, while more saturated bright whites lend a futuristic touch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p> <img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://i0.wp.com/blingingbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Tracy+Reese+Spring+2014+Backstage+qYfTHf4VbVdl.jpg?resize=400%2C600" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Cat eyeliner and kohl-rimmed eyes: Who can resist the playful come hither quality of a saucy cat eye? The playful yet exacting look of a perfectly lined cat eye spotted at Tracy Reese had us at hello. Those craving a bit more edge can try their hand at the sultry smudgy kohl-rimmed eyes that was also popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Less is more</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.elle.com/cm/elle/images/S1/elle-isabel-marant-spring-2014-rtw-15-de-74538868-xln.jpg" width="560" height="840" /></strong></p>
<p>2014 is the time to take a less is more approach to beauty. Think minimal makeup looks that let the natural beauty of your skin shine through. To prepare your skin, get glowing with D.I.Y. masks and treatments found <a title="Winter Skin Detox : Bentonite Clay Mask" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/28/winter-skin-detox-bentonite-clay-mask/">here</a> and <a title="5 Beauty DIYs You Should Try This Weekend" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/18/5-beauty-diys-you-should-try-this-weekend/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>P.S.-Bet on Pantone’s color of the year, Radiant Orchid, as a key beauty hue.</p>

The <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/26/where-do-bad-hair-days-come-from/" target="_blank">changing temperatures</a> can dry out your hair and leave it looking lifeless and dull. And let's not forget about the snow. Sure making snow angels is fun, but the wetness from snow can destroy the <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/12/hair-trends-for-2014/" target="_blank">fabulous hairstyle</a> you worked so hard to create!</p>
<p>So, how can a busy gal like you <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/17/4-things-you-should-be-doing-to-keep-shiny-hair/" target="_blank">keep your hair shiny</a> during these cold months!? To start, schedule regular trims, <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/17/hair-dye-box-vs-professional/" target="_blank">avoid box hair color</a>, stay hydrated, and <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/category/tutorials-diy/" target="_blank">keep your hairstyle versatile</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/How-to-Get-Shinier-Hair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31926" alt="How to Get Shinier Hair" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/How-to-Get-Shinier-Hair.jpg" width="750" height="1000" /></a></p>
<p>But if you are really ready to shine bright in 2014, make sure you have at <em>least one</em> of these products incorporated into your hair care routine:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Spray on the shine! </strong><a href=" http://www.jadabeauty.com/shine-spray.html" target="_blank">It's a 10 Shine Spray</a> improves elasticity, minimizes frizz, and provides thermal protection all at once. The spray uses antioxidants to lock in any missing moisture and give you more styling control. Using this shine spray is quick and easy- simply spray it on to wet or dry hair and style away!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Try a new shampoo!</strong> The secret to better shine might be easy as switching shampoos. I am MADLY in love with <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/paul-mitchell-teatree-special-shampoo-10-14-oz.html" target="_blank">Paul Mitchell's TeaTree Shampoo</a> and <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/paul-mitchell-teatree-special-conditioner-10-14-oz.html" target="_blank">Conditioner</a>. Even my husband is hooked on this shampoo. The shampoo is formulated with tea tree oil, lavender and peppermint. Both the smell and feel on your scalp is cooling, refreshing and energizing! The special combination of cleansers and tea tree oil helps clear impurities and leaves your hair full of life and luster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) Use a serum to control frizz and add shine all at once!</strong> Try <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/osis-magic-anti-frizz-shine-serum.html" target="_blank">Schwarzkopf Pro Osis+ Magic Anti-Frizz Shine Serum</a> to create a glossy finish and help prevent frizzy hair. This magical serum contains a blend of silicone agents and Glycerine to offer smooth nourishment and create a shiny finish. For best results, apply this serum to damp hair before you blow dry your hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4) Give your hair an oil change)!</strong> Yes, it's true that your hair creates natural helps that keep your hair healthy and shiny, but you can always use <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/ag-hair-the-oil-1-oz.html" target="_blank">AG Hair The Oil</a> to create silky smooth hair that lasts for days! This product is made with extra virgin Agran oil, which is lightweight and non-greasy. Don't be too upset if random strangers start touching your silky, smooth hair - this product truly does create a desirable and touchable appearance. Kidding, but really just be prepared for extra hair compliments and stares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5) Whip it good!</strong> Take Devo's advice (and sing along with me now), "When a problem comes along - you must whip it!" Try using <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/paul-mitchell-awapuhi-wild-ginger-hydrocream-whip-2-3-oz.html" target="_blank">Paul Mitchell's Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip</a> to hydrate and smooth thirsty hair for a silky finish. For optimal results, apply this cream to damp hair, blow dry, and finish by spraying on <a href=" http://www.jadabeauty.com/old-freeze-and-shine-super-spray.html" target="_blank">shine spray</a>.</p>

<p>1. Divide your hair into two equal sections. Tie one out of the way with an elastic.</p>
<p>2. Hold the loose section out in one hand.</p>
<p>3. Starting mid-shaft, wrap the end around your thumb.</p>
<p>4. Roll the rest of the strand up until it's right up against your scalp.</p>
<p>5. Secure the roll against your head with a bobby pin at the bottom of the roll.</p>
<p>6. Repeat step 5 at the top of the roll.</p>
<p>7. Add any additional pins as needed until the roll feels secure against your head. Don't worry if it's messy - that's the best part!</p>
<p>8. Remove the elastic from the other section of your hair, then hold it out in one hand.</p>
<p>9. Like before, roll the end of section around your thumb.</p>
<p>10. Roll the section all the way up to your scalp, covering the first rolled section.</p>
<p>11. Pin the big roll against your head on top and bottom, then add any additional pins as needed to make the twist feel secure against your head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every morning three important events happen. We pick out our outfits, do our makeup, then attempt to create a masterpiece out of our hair. While we have all had outfit and makeup mishaps, I think we can agree that NOTHING, and I mean nothing, makes a morning more frustrating than <a title="Taming Your Morning Hair Madness" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2012/10/09/morning-hair/">untamed tresses</a> that will not and can not do what you want.</p>
<p>The worst part of it all? You never know when a bad hair day is coming or why bad hair days even exist. I can't tell you how many times I have stood, curling iron in hand, going over my hair routine in my head, questioning what I could have done wrong the night before.</p>
<p>The truth? I didn't mess up and neither did you. There is actual SCIENTIFIC evidence on bad hair days now - and it just might save you a lot of hair-ache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3 Reasons for Bad Hair Days</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Don't Meddle with Metal</strong><br />
A study that was released in July 2013, found that washing hair with water containing copper led to split ends and <a title="Protecting Your Edges from Damage: Preventing Traction Alopecia" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/01/13/protecting-your-edges-from-damage/">unmanageable hair</a>. Seems avoidable right? Just don't rub any metal on your hair and you will be A-OK. Yea...except they also found that ALL 450 women tested (from all over the world) had varying levels of copper. You know what that means? We probably ALL have some level of copper in our water playing tricks on our hair. The good news is our friendly professionals are working to create products that will combat copper! In the meantime, opt for monthly treatments at your salon that will keep your hair in check. Talk this out with your stylist to figure out what your need is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Watch out for the Weather</strong><br />
There are different bonds in your hair that give it it's makeup. By increasing the <a title="Transitioning Tresses: Winter to Spring" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/04/04/transitioning-tresses/">moisture</a> in the air, hydrogen bonds within the hair follicle are broken causing your initial style to fall apart. This moisture can be picked up inside your house as well, making your style "off" from the minute you wake up. As you may already know the tell-tale signs of a <a title="Hateful Humidity: 4 Updos to Beat the Heat" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/06/19/4-updos-to-beat-the-heat-and-humidity/">weather </a>induced bad hair day; curly hair turns frizzy, straight hair turns flat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) Steer Clear of Sulfate</strong><br />
If you are using a shampoo with a high level of sulfate, your scalp can become dried out.    Typically, shampoos that get super-foamy when you apply them are the one's you need to avoid (AKA store-bought brands). You're best bet for combating this type of hair day, is to opt for professional products (think <a title="Our Week with Joico: Repairing and Restoring with K-Pak" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/20/our-week-with-joico-repairing-and-restoring-with-k-pak/">Joico </a>and Paul Mitchell). I don't care what you have heard on the street, <a title="Why Professional Hair Products are Better than the Drugstore Version" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2012/12/09/professional-vs-drugstore/">store-brand</a> shampoos and conditioners are NOT at the same level as professional products. Store-brand (like Pantene) can only temporarily conceal hair damage (they refer to this as "surface damage"), but never actual get to the core issue of your hair. Hence the resulting bad hair days.</p>

In reality, those products are only going to accumulate dust--a major display turn-off--if you don't put in work to ensure your retail success. Here are seven ways to put in effort that won't only help with sales, but will help make you a better stylist and business person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/7-Secrets-to-Retail-Success.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31782" alt="7 Secrets to Retail Success" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/7-Secrets-to-Retail-Success.jpg" width="667" height="1000" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Educate, educate, educate!</strong> The fundamental building block of selling is being well-educated on your product. Spend time to research your product lines and determine which products are best for which hair types and problems. Experiment with products you're not as familiar with to learn how they work. Seize every education opportunity from your product lines, whether participating in trainings, or, if a salon owner, bringing in training for your stylists to further their expert knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Use company resources. </strong>Aside from trainings, many salon brands provide additional resources that go unused. Possible resources include product displays and marketing materials (posters, mirror clings, etc.) and public relations assistance to get your name out there as a stylist/salon selling their product.</p>
<p><strong>Use more than one display. </strong>One shelf inside the front door isn't going to draw attention to the products you offer. In fact, some studies show that sitting products right inside the door is one of your worst bets since clients have an adjustment period once they enter the space. Instead, utilize a dedicated retail space with display as well as smaller, focused displays throughout. Consider placing a few key products that work for the season or that work together as great combos at stylist stations. And remember to switch it up! The seasons are a good chance to switch smaller displays and push different and new products.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporate your brand identity. </strong>What are your brand colors? What's your brand's authentic voice? Don't let your brand get lost in the sales mentality. Carry it over to custom marketing materials and signs for products, <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/06/19/how-to-create-an-email-newsletter-for-clients/">email newsletters</a>, and product promotions via social media. Consider using your brand's colors in in-store displays as well to keep things pulled together and consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Offer testers and samples. </strong>Whether a new candle, body gel, lipstick or a new interesting styling spray, the first thing customers want is to smell the product. Invest in sanitary ways to put testers out in the salon and/or styling stations so clients can catch a whiff of that fragrant new conditioner or get a feel for that CHI Matte Wax you're sure would make their hair year. Sample sizes of products are also a great way to reward top clients and keep them interested in new products. Consider putting together small gift bags to give during special promotions, events or the holidays. Include information about the products they're receiving and ways to purchase, whether in person at the salon or through online options through your profile here.</p>
<p><strong>Engage through social media. </strong>Make product mentions and promotions a regular part of your social media rotation. Show off newly decorated displays, arrivals of new lines, and reviews of favorite products. Always make sure clients know how to buy them from you, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Talk to your clients. </strong>Remember you're not selling a cheap used car; you're selling clients a way to take you home with them and recreate the looks they love! Remember that you are your clients' resource for getting great hair, and they can't do it without products. Be sure to always talk to them about their hair challenges and concerns, what they're currently using, and go over all of the products you're using on them and why. If you don't start conversations, they likely won't do it themselves, and you're missing out an opportunity to make a sale.</p>

Well, besides being ridiculously good looking - they are all supporters of the male ponytail!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brad-Pitt-Man-Pony.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31771" alt="Brad Pitt Man Pony" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brad-Pitt-Man-Pony.png" width="598" height="459" /></a></p>
<p>Not all male ponytails are created equally. In fact, there are many variations of the male ponytail. Let's take a look at a few of the most popular styles.</p>
<p><strong>The Short Pony: Chris Hemsworth</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Male-Ponytail-Hit-or-Miss.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31772" alt="The Male Ponytail Hit or Miss" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Male-Ponytail-Hit-or-Miss.jpg" width="465" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>The most popular style right now is probably the short pony. Thor star Chris Hemsworth rocks a slicked back and short ponytail that makes the ladies swoon. Chord Overstreet from Glee was recently on Ellen representing a short male ponytail too!</p>
<p><strong>The High Pony: David Beckham</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Male-Ponytail-Hit-or-Miss-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31773" alt="The Male Ponytail Hit or Miss 2" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/The-Male-Ponytail-Hit-or-Miss-2.jpg" width="456" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>Male athletes are no stranger to the male ponytail. Soccer star (and certified heartthrob) David Beckham often sports a high ponytail on and off the field! Bradley Cooper has also been seen in a shaggy, high ponytail too. Seriously though- how cute is that little, high ponytail? Most guys can't make this look work!</p>
<p><strong>The Bun: Charlie Hunnam</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Charlie-Hunnam-Ponytail.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31774" alt="Charlie Hunnam Ponytail" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Charlie-Hunnam-Ponytail.png" width="538" height="632" /></a></p>
<p>Every good ponytail needs a style. And Charlie Hunnam gives his ponytail some character by putting it into a messy bun. You win, Charlie. You win.</p>
<p><strong>The Long Pony:  Brad Pitt</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brad-Pitt-Ponytail.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31775" alt="Brad Pitt Ponytail" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Brad-Pitt-Ponytail.png" width="414" height="610" /></a></p>
<p>Brad Pitt is probably the most famous (and long lasting) supporter of the male ponytail. Brad has been spotted with a ponytails of all lengths and styles throughout the years, but he is most often seen with a longer or medium length ponytail.</p>
<p><strong>The Double Pony: Snoop Dogg</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Snoop-Dogg-Ponytail.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31776" alt="Snoop Dogg Ponytail" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Snoop-Dogg-Ponytail.jpg" width="456" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>What's better (or worse depending on your ponytail preference) than one ponytail? TWO! For as long as I can remember, Snoop Dogg has always styled his hair in double (or more) ponytail braids.</p>
<p>Personally, I think with the right blend of confidence, the perfect haircut / length, and using styling products such as <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/forming-cream.html" target="_blank">American Crew Forming Cream</a>- guys can absolutely rock the male ponytail!

<p>I'm in my 20s now... shouldn't acne be a part of my past? Shouldn't I be able to stick some product in my hair without worrying about acne flare-ups on my forehead and cheeks not long after?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's not how it works. Our face is one of the MOST sensitive skin areas on our body. We have to take extra care of our skin and that means paying attention to what's in our favorite hair products. If you've experienced some acne around your forehead or parts of your skin that your hair may touch, it's time to evaluate what's in your hair products. Today I'll outline some ingredients that you should avoid if you have sensitive skin.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Say No To Sulfates</strong>: Ingredients such as <em>sodium laureth sulfate </em>and <em>sodium lauryl sulfate</em> are two red flags in particular. Sulfate based ingredients leave a film on your skin that can cause acne flare-ups. Keep an eye out and try to avoid sulfate based ingredients as much as possible.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Be On The Lookout For Oils</strong>: It's pretty well-known that oils such as argan, moroccan, coconut, and grapeseed are fantastic for your hair. But what about your skin? Not always the case. Be extra careful when using products that include oil based products. The oil is great for your hair but not so much for your skin. Make sure you put less on the areas that directly touch your face.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Swipe Salicylic Acid Wipes For Clear Skin:  </strong>I totally get it. When I noticed that some of my products were more apt to break my skin out I wasn't crazy about the idea of the cold turkey method on my favorite combos. But there are other solutions! I read a great tip from <a href="http://www.self.com/beauty/2013/04/things-that-make-you-break-out-slideshow#slide=4">Self</a> that mentioned swiping the skin near your hairline with a salicylic acid a couple of times a day. This will help prevent breakouts and keep your skin clear.</p>
<p>Have you noticed your hair products breaking you out? If so, what have you done differently?</p>
<p>For the love of clear and fabulous skin,<br />

An hour or so of pampering, chatting, and a fabulous hair style? Um, count me in. My home city of Indianapolis was lucky enough to (finally!) be graced our very own blowout bar! <a href="http://www.do-tique.com/">do-tique, a blow and go bar</a> just opened earlier this week.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a blowout bar is much different than a regular salon. There's no cuts, colors, highlights, or creation of fabulous lobs. It's all about pampering yourself and creating the perfect hairstyle to last for the next 3-5 days depending on your hair type. Your scalp is massaged, you are offered a beverage of your choice (I chose wine, duh), and you can sit back and relax while the fabulous stylists transform your hair.</p>
<p>For my first experience with a blowout bar, my expectations were medium at best. do-tique blew me away, guys. Blew me away. Everyone that works there is fabulous, sweet, talented, and brilliant. When it started off with a scalp massage while someone else was washing my hair...I didn't think it could get any better. But it did. Oh, it did.</p>
<p>Here I am....three days later...and my hair is STILL looking fabulous and that's after a zumba class last night, ladies!</p>
<p>I took my bestie for an afternoon of pampering and we both LOVED it. I would go back in a second. My only suggestion? If you're wary of how your hair will look- use their book to pick out a style that you want! It's so easy.</p>
<p>Noel said: "<em>My stylist amazed me. She did things to my hair that I didn't know were possible. And we were treated like queens...all for $35. Would I go back? Absolutely. In a second. A blowout would be perfect for my upcoming graduation from college. And the best part is that it lasts for days!"</em></p>

<p>Our fabulous marketing manager <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/author/melanie/">Melanie</a> is a blowout veteran. She went to visit do-tique on opening day (and got to hang out with celeb super stylist David Evangelista!) Here's what she said about her visit to do-tique and how it stacks up to other blowouts she's had.</p>
<p>"<em>My do-tique experience was fabulous. Kortney was my stylist and she went above and beyond the typical blowout experience. One thing that really stood out to me was how thorough Kortney was when talking to me about which products she was using, why she was using them, and how much to use. I really felt like I was being educated and empowered to recreate the style. </em></p>
<p><em>"Best of all, my blowout lasted a full five days. FIVE. I drilled my stylist for tips on how to make it last.

<p>So there you have it, ladies. Our experiences with the next generation of styling: blowouts. Wondering when you should choose a blowout bar vs. a regular salon? Here's some tips:</p>
<p>- Blowout bars are perfect for occasions. Have a date? Graduation party? Baby shower? Don't have a lot of time to get ready? Schedule a blowout. Your hair will look fabulous and you will have one less thing to worry about.<br />
- Don't choose a blowout if you want a cut, color, highlight, etc. They're JUST for styling.<br />
- If you have questions about haircare, you can go to either as blowout bar stylists are certified hair stylists, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think? Is it time to schedule an appointment? We think so. ;)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With love and obsession of new blowout bars,<br />

Well, over the top nail art is definitely growing up a bit. While nail trends are toning down, they’re anything but boring.  Here’s what’s on the radar for nails in the new year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Back to Black</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_165810596.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31605" title="black nail polish trend 2014" alt="black nail polish trend 2014" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_165810596.jpg" width="480" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>Moody black polishes continue to surprise by adding a fresh twist to nail design. Inky hues are at their best next season when they’re used to create abstract french manicures, dramatic angular streaks and striking line art on nails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stripes and Line Art</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://ww4.fashionspassion.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/spring_2014_runway_nail_designs_geometric_nails.jpg" /></p>
<p>Speaking of line art, simplicity is key for a new breed of nail art. Graphic lines and windowpane patterns set against a colorful background stole the show at Tibi and Tracy Reese. With this trend there’s lots of potential to nail down creative DIY manicures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sheer nails</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_153653585.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31607" title="sheer nail polish trend 2014" alt="sheer nail polish trend 2014" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_153653585-758x1024.jpg" width="467" height="630" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, an office friendly manicure trend! The classic sheer nail is back and it’s like a breath of fresh air.  If you’re not quite ready to give up <a title="Fall in Love with These Fall Colored Polishes" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/07/30/best-fall-colored-polishes/" target="_blank">full coverage polish</a> for barely there nails, try an opaque nude polish instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>White nails + accents</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_127599071.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31606" title="white half moon nail trend 2014" alt="white half moon nail trend 2014" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_127599071-1024x1024.jpg" width="467" height="467" /></a></p>
<p>White out inspired nails were a spring runway staple. They feel appropriate as we start a fresh new year.  Although dramatic press on versions were en vogue at NYFW, the look of just a plain allover paint job or polish used to create a contrasting half moon is just as impactful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3-D nails</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.salonfanatic.com/wp-content/uploads/Cushnie-221.jpg?resize=682%2C1024" width="477" height="717" /></strong></p>
<p>While most 2014 nail trends are indeed subdued, we couldn't leave you without reporting on at least one notice me nail trend. Take the 3-D nails featured at Cushnie et Ochs spring show. This idea made beautiful use of silver sculptural details to create a pretty metallic look. You could substitute the standout silver streak for gold or a vivid streak of color for a bold spin on the trend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate bad hair days. No matter how posh my outfit is or how chic my makeup looks that day...bad, frizzy hair ruins it for me. I'm always on the lookout for tips and tricks to help reduce frizz, add shine, and make my hair look more luscious. And my favorite type of tips and tricks? The ones you can do yourself right at home. Here we go!</p>
<p>1. <strong>Bobby Pins That Stay In Place: </strong>For everyone like me who has soft, sometimes limp hair...the bobby pins just don't always stay where I want them to. I could spend hours creating an awesome hair style only to find the bobby pins sliding out and ruining the look 30 minutes later! Except not anymore. Because now...I know how to make sticky bobby pins. And you're about to learn, too! All you need to do is assemble some of your favorite bobby pins on a paper towel. Once they're lined up, spray them! Spray your favorite <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/volume-spray-25.html">hair spray</a> all over those pins until you think it's distributed evenly. Then, let them dry and use! It's as easy as that. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>No Frizz Towel Dry: </strong>You know when you step out of the shower and your hair is sopping wet and full of luscious nutrients from that hair mask you just used? And then you towel dry it and yet it still dries super frizzy and feels harsh? That might be because of your towel. Towels are actually not very good for our hair. They're harsh and can break hair follicles causing extra frizz. All you need for this trick is a clean t-shirt. Come on, you know you have your alma mater t-shirt lying around somewhere. Put it to good use! Dry your hair off with a t-shirt from now on and reduce that frizz.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Cold Rinse: </strong>Frizz is what happens when the cuticle of your hair is raised or open. There are a lot of methods to help frizz once you step out of the shower; but what about while in the shower? There's a trick for that, too. Start rinsing out your conditioner with colder water. I mean, yeah, we all love relaxing hot showers. But that cold water is going to keep your hair more frizz-free, shiny, and amazing. Trust me!</p>
<p>4. <strong>Tease Your Hair Not Your Teeth: </strong>Having a flat hair day? Feeling like your roots are just sticking to your scalp? I totally feel you. I was in the same predicament the other day and I didn't have any teasing combs or lift powder around me. So, I used my toothbrush! Totally weird, right? No, brilliant. Toothbrushes can help tease your hair in the hard to reach places. They can also be used to help tame frizz. Bad hair day be gone. Just make sure you don't use it on your teeth again afterwards!</p>

<p>It's no big surprise that I'm a fan of <a title="Natural Hair How-To : 3 Vintage Styles For Fall" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/08/29/natural-hair-how-to-3-vintage-styles-for-fall/" target="_blank">vintage</a> style. I mean, who isn't? Especially when it comes to <a title="The Ultimate Natural Hair Guide" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/13/the-ultimate-natural-hair-guide/" target="_blank">natural hair.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/janelle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31683" alt="janelle" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/janelle.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Since I'm always trying to expand on my options for <a title="Knot So Good: Why We Love the Bantu Knots and Twist Outs" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/06/knot-so-good-why-we-love-the-bantu-knot/" target="_blank">natural hairstyles</a> I thought it would be perfect to play around with retro looks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these looks, I flat-twisted my hair the night before to add some texture and shape to my hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What I used to create these styles</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- Hair pins<br />
- CHI Shine Infusion Spray<br />
- Headscarf<br />
- Hair tie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">So here's what I was thinking..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rolled bang + Low bun</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rolled-bang.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31659" alt="rolled bang" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/rolled-bang.jpg" width="536" height="681" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rolled-bang-with-low-bun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31675" alt="Rolled bang with low bun" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rolled-bang-with-low-bun.jpg" width="800" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make a part in the front for a bang and put the rest of your hair into a low ponytail.</p>
<p>2. Begin rolling your bang.</p>
<p>3. Secure with a few hair pins.</p>
<p>4. This is how your finished bang should look.</p>
<p>5. For this step I have longer hair so I'm taking the hair tie out and only using pins for my bun. For shorter hair, omit this step and leave your hair in the low ponytail.</p>
<p>6. Twist your ponytail into a small bun.</p>
<p>7. Secure firmly with a few hair pins.</p>
<p>8. Tie a headscarf around your head and in the front, tie two knots.</p>

<p>How cute is this bob? Our tutorial guru <a title="Hannah Shaner blogs" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/author/hannah/" target="_blank">Hannah Shaner</a> definitely inspired my love for this 'do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Take your hair down.</p>
<p>2. Grab one side of the hair with one hand.</p>
<p>3. Roll hair under and secure with a few hair pins.</p>
<p>4. Roll the back and secure with pins.</p>
<p>5. Grab the remaining hair on the other side, roll and pin.</p>
<p>6. With your bangs, you want to tuck the ends by your ear and secure with more hair pins.</p>

<p>I've gone a little crazy for this style lately and I love it because it's so easy and also very elegant. <strong>Do not be discouraged if you have shorter hair</strong>, this style is quite flexible for various hair lengths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use a few hair pins to pin up your hair in the back.</p>
<p>2. Your sides should hang down like this.</p>
<p>3. Pin one side up, folding any stray hairs or loose ends and use extra pins to secure hair.</p>
<p>4. Repeat with the other side.</p>
<p>5. Pin the top of the bouffant.</p>
<p>6. At this point you can use extra hair pins to perfect the shape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...And there you have it! Three new 'dos to add to your collection. Don't forget to add a little shine to your hair with a little CHI Shine Infusion Spray. Enjoy!</p>

The moment I’ve been dreading since I had my beautiful little baby boy in September – I am balding. Okay, that’s a little dramatic, but my hair is definitely <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/03/25/tips-for-postpartum-hair-loss/" target="_blank">thinning due to the postpartum hormones</a>. After pulling out globs of hair out in the shower one day, I called my hairstylist to schedule a haircut.</p>
<p>At first, I started stalking <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz" target="_blank">Beauty Buzz</a> and <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/shopjadabeauty/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> for haircut inspiration. But I quickly realized I needed to narrow my search based on my hair type. I kept seeing beautiful hairstyles and cuts that simply wouldn’t work with my fine and <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/05/20/help-why-is-my-hair-falling-out/" target="_blank">thinning hair</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is a difference between fine hair vs. <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/31/are-you-making-your-hair-thinner/" target="_blank">thin hair</a>! The diameter of each hair strand is what makes hair fine. Fine hair has a smaller diameter than average hair, but the hair itself can be thin or plentiful. So, you can have thick, fine hair. Or in my case, I have thin, fine hair.</p>
<p>Because fine hair is generally soft, it has a tendency to fall flat or break! To overcome this problem, it’s important for you to find a great haircut, <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/shop.html" target="_blank">use the right products</a>, and rock a flattering style.</p>
<p>You can give your fine hair the illusion of thickness by trying out one of these great haircuts:</p>
<p><strong>Haircut #1:</strong> Go short with heavy bangs!</p>
<p><strong>Celebrity Inspiration:</strong> Cameron Diaz</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haircut-Styles-for-Women-with-Fine-Hair-Cameron-Diaz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31713" alt="Haircut Styles for Women with Fine Hair Cameron Diaz" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haircut-Styles-for-Women-with-Fine-Hair-Cameron-Diaz.jpg" width="499" height="700" /></a></p>
<p>Cameron Diaz looks great in this short haircut that has <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/08/23/the-best-bangs-for-your-face-shape/" target="_blank">heavy side bangs</a>. By going with a shorter cut, it helps the hair from getting weighed down and falling flat.  You can also use a volumizing mousse such a <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/volume-mousse-extra-17.html" target="_blank">Kenra Classic Volume Mousse Extra 17 Firm Hold</a> to keep the style in place all day long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Haircut #2:</strong> Smooth shag</p>
<p><strong>Celebrity Inspiration:</strong> Dianna Agron</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haircut-Styles-for-Women-with-Fine-Hair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31714" alt="Haircut Styles for Women with Fine Hair" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haircut-Styles-for-Women-with-Fine-Hair.jpg" width="467" height="700" /></a></em></p>
<p>Dianna Agron is the queen of finding perfect haircuts that flatter her fine hair – she’s found short, medium, and even long haircuts that keep her hair looking healthy and fierce. My personal favorite is this photo above. The subtle layers and swoopy bangs in this shaggy haircut frame her <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/24/how-to-choose-the-right-hair-style-for-your-face/" target="_blank">face shape perfectly</a> and she adds extra volume by teasing her hair along the top and sides of her hair. Try using <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/powder-play.html" target="_blank">Big Sexy Hair Powder Play</a> to add sass, volume, and control to your hair!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Haircut #3:</strong> Keep it long with layers and waves!</p>
<p><strong>Celebrity Inspiration:</strong> Carrie Underwood</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haircut-Styles-for-Women-with-Fine-Hair-Carrie-Underwood.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-31715" alt="Haircut Styles for Women with Fine Hair Carrie Underwood" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Haircut-Styles-for-Women-with-Fine-Hair-Carrie-Underwood.jpg" width="467" height="700" /></a></em></p>
<p>Despite what most people think, you can have fine AND long hair! Carrie Underwood looks great in this long haircut with layers. She adds the appearance of volume by styling her hair with beautiful waves. Want to steal this look? Here is a <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/07/17/4-steps-to-kate-middleton-waves/" target="_blank">super easy tutorial on mastering waves</a> such as Carrie and Kate Middleton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final rule of thumb:</strong> A haircut that looks fabulous someone with thick hair probably won’t look great on someone with really fine hair (and vice versa). Always consider your hair type before jumping into a new haircut or style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not 100% which style to choose? Talk it over with your stylist at your appointment. Stylists always have the best understanding of what will work best for your hair texture!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the love of (fine) hair,</p>

The two most popular ways to remove unwanted hair are shaving and waxing. Is one method better than the other? Let's break it down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wax-VS-Shave-The-Mans-Guide-to-Proper-Body-Hair-Removal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31710" alt="Wax VS Shave  The Man's Guide to Proper Body Hair Removal" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wax-VS-Shave-The-Mans-Guide-to-Proper-Body-Hair-Removal.jpg" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Shaving</strong>:</p>
<p>-Cost effective:  Although you may have to buy more tools for the job, shaving is definitely the cheaper of the two options.</p>
<p>-Efficient:  Easiest to do while doing something else.  You can complete you daily shaving tasks while in the shower.  Or you can take the time after you're done getting clean.  Although, shaving while in the shower (or immediately after) is the best option because that is when your pores will be the most open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risks of Shaving:</strong></p>
<p>-Cuts and Scrapes:  If you are not careful and don’t shave with the grain, you can open yourself (literally) to infection and ingrown hairs.  You never want to shave against the grain because this will pull hairs out, giving you ingrown hairs that can get infected.</p>
<p>-Razor Burn:  Improper shaving can also give you razor burn which will inflame that skin and could lead to serious rashes and abrasions in the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wax-VS-Shave-The-Mans-Guide-to-Proper-Body-Hair-Removal-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31711" alt="Wax VS Shave The Man's Guide to Proper Body Hair Removal 2" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Wax-VS-Shave-The-Mans-Guide-to-Proper-Body-Hair-Removal-2.jpg" width="664" height="1000" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Waxing</strong>:</p>
<p>-Lasts Longer:  When you wax you are pulling the hair out roots and all, if done properly.  So naturally it will take longer for the hair to come back as opposed to shaving, where you are essentially trimming the hair and causing a faster growth back.  It is like giving the hair on your head a trim.</p>
<p>-Smooth Skin:  You won’t get the stubble you get when you shave if you chose waxing.  It will leave your skin silkier and smoother in the long run.  You won’t have to worry about going out in the cold after a waxing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risks of Waxing:</strong></p>
<p>-Body Burns:  You have to heat up the wax for it to spread evenly over the hairy area. This can lead to burning your skin if you are doing the home treatment.  It may be safer to go out to the salon and get it done, but as discussed earlier, it will cost you.</p>
<p>-Irritated Skin:  Using wax can be harmful for the skin as well just by being an irritant.  It may pull the hair out, but it comes at a price.  Even if using the proper temperature, you can still bother you skin because of the unnaturally warm product sitting for so long on the bare skin.  Much like tanning for too long in the bed, waxing will leave your skin red and radiating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me shaving seems to be the safest, easiest way to be rid of the unwanted hairs.  You should also be aware that you want to use crème instead of soap while in the shower.  It may seem simpler since you are already using some to wash the skin, but soap or body wash does not react to the skin the way a crème will.  You will also want to shave after you finish washing so that the pores are fully open. This makes for a cleaner shave.</p>
<p>And while you may have shave more often, it is easy to add as another step in getting ready for the day.  Although, you may want the get some help reaching your backside.</p>

There are things we do on a daily basis that can make and keep our hair shiny. Follow these 4 easy tips to get your hair shiny and keep it that way!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/4-Things-You-SHOULD-Be-Doing-To-Keep-Shiny-Hair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31622" alt="4 Things You SHOULD Be Doing To Keep Shiny Hair" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/4-Things-You-SHOULD-Be-Doing-To-Keep-Shiny-Hair.jpg" width="667" height="1000" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Get a great hair cut and color</strong><br />
First things first: <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/search" target="_blank">Find a great stylist</a>. Most importantly, build a relationship with <a title="How Your Stylist Can Help You" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/13/how-your-stylist-can-help-you/" target="_blank">your stylist</a> so when it comes to your hair, you know you’re in good hands. When I say get a great color, I’m specifically talking about salon color. The fastest way to strip your hair of shine is with box color. Need more convincing? Here’s the <a title="Hair Dye: Box vs. Professional" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/17/hair-dye-box-vs-professional/" target="_blank">details on box color</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ramp up your nighttime hair routine</strong><br />
A few drops of hair oil on the ends, a <a title="5 Ways to Work On Your Beauty While You Sleep" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/23/5-ways-to-work-on-your-beauty-while-you-sleep/" target="_blank">satin pillowcase</a>, and a loose braid with a wide scrunchie will keep your hair safe over night. Taking care of your hair at night will ensure that it stays healthy and looks great throughout the day.  Try adding <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/ag-hair-the-oil-1-oz.html" target="_blank">AG Hair The Oil</a> to your night time hair routine.</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep your hairstyle versatile</strong><br />
Don’t straighten your hair everyday and don’t curl your hair everyday. Doing your hair the same way everyday will continually damage it in the same way. For example, when I was a waitress in college, my stylist could tell I wore my hair in a ponytail a lot because of where all my hair was breaking off. Mix up your style with any of these <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/search/diy/?" target="_blank">DIY hair tutorials</a>. Repair your hair quickly with <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/paul-mitchell-awapuhi-wild-ginger-keratin-intensive-treatment.html" target="_blank">Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Intensive Treatment.</a></p>
<p><strong>4. Stay hydrated</strong><br />
Drinking water and staying hydrated it not only going to help your hair but your skin and over-all healthy. It's recommended that women drink just a little more that 2 liters a day. When you're dehydrated, your hair becomes dry which can cause breakage. Stay hydrated and keep your hair healthy.</p>
<p>It’s as easy as finding a great stylist, taking care of your hair over night, keeping your style versatile, and staying hydrate and you should be able to keep your hair shiny and healthy.</p>

But what happens if that stylist moves locations? Or when you move to a different area? Or when it's just time for someone new?</p>
<p>You need to start the search for a new stylist all over again. Where do you start? Here are some tips on what to look for in a new stylist so that your hair is left in the right hands.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_149076893.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31304" alt="Don't Leave your Hair in the Wrong Hands " src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shutterstock_149076893.jpg" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Start online!</strong> Use our site to <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/search" target="_blank">search for salons and stylists</a> based on your location, budget, and your specific needs. Need a curly hair wizard? Someone who specializes in color? You'll be able to find it - and read reviews from the stylist's clients.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ask around!</strong> Another great way to find a new stylist is word of mouth.  If you see someone with a style that you like or a color that you want to try, ask her who her stylist is. (and it's a fun way to give a compliment!) Direct contact with others is a great way to get a firsthand and honest review of someone’s work. They can also tell you places that you want to avoid in the area. This is a great option if you're just moving to a new city.</p>
<p><strong>Get Social (Media, That is)!</strong> Along with word of mouth take a look at social media, too. You can find excellent reviews on business pages as well as asking people who may be on a community page for your town. Social media has been responsible for business growth over the last few years and is an excellent resource to find out where to go and where not to go. People usually do not hold back on their reviews when they are online because they have the freedom of not being face to face. However, social media should be used as a secondary source as the business owners have control of their pages and can remove reviews that they feel may hurt their business.</p>
<p>If you do enough research and look through all of the reviews that you can, you should be able to find the perfect stylist for your needs. Your hair will thank you for it!</p>

Not only is it ranking in dough at the box office - but it is also inspiring a raft of bold and creative braided hairstyles! Don’t believe it? Just think about the Everdeen sisters, Prim and Katniss. These popular characters have made intricate <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/22/4-winter-braids-to-warm-up-your-look" target="_blank">braided styles</a> one of the hottest hair trends of the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re ready to try them out for yourself, here are three braided hairstyles inspired by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Prim Everdeen’s Wrap Around Braid</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/katniss-prim-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-thumb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31483" alt="katniss-prim-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-thumb" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/katniss-prim-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-thumb.jpg" width="433" height="222" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most notable hairstyles in Catching Fire was Prim’s Wrap Around Braid. This hairstyle winds a braid from one side all the way down to the other. It is dramatic yet a little bit sweet, so you can wear it just about anywhere! To achieve this style, you’ll need a brush, comb, curling iron, hair elastic, and hairspray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start by taking a 1-inch barrel curling iron. <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/31/which-curling-technique-is-right-for-you/" target="_blank">Curl the length of your hair</a>, concentrating the majority of the curl on the lower half. Once your hair has been completely curled, create a deep side part on the left. Take a section of hair from the back of the part and separate it into three smaller sections. Begin forming lace braid, adding hair to the side of the braid closest to the part. The braid should be heading downward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your braid gets close to the face, start curving it slightly. This will help create that wrap around shape you’re after! As you continue, add in hair from both sides of the braid. You will need to do this until you hit just above the ear. From there, change up your technique and start adding in hair to the top side of the braid instead. Continue your lace braid along the back of your head, making sure it curves toward the left ear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your braid has reached the left ear, braid the remainder tightly and secure with a hair elastic. The rest of your hair should be left down so that it is loosely curled. To finish off this unforgettable braided style, use the <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/aquage-freezing-spray.html" target="_blank">Aquage Freezing Spray.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Prim Everdeen’s Bow Braid</h1>
<div id="attachment_31625" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width:1034px;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PrimCatchingFire_zps3813f49f.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-31625" alt="Prim's Braid Catching Fire" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PrimCatchingFire_zps3813f49f.jpg" width="1024" height="602" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">This braid was created by Kaylee at Divine Number Seven!</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’ve got some <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/25/3-ultimate-braided-dos-for-natural-hair/" target="_blank">serious braiding skills</a>, then this next Catching Fire hairstyle is right up your alley! You may have noticed Prim’s Bow Braid during the Reaping scene in the latest film. (If you didn’t, be sure to watch closely next time!) It is a great way to make a serious statement with your hair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get this look, separate your hair into three sections: two front sections and one back section. Tie the back section with a hair elastic to keep it out of the way. Next, you’ll need to take a small section of hair from the front – but make sure the section is parallel to your part. Since this will be the hair you use to get that fun bow pattern, you can simply pin this section to the side for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the right section of hair, French Braid, working back towards the ear. Secure with a hair elastic when you reach the ear and do the same on the left side. Ready for that bow braid? Put a bobby pin directly through the front of your braid. Then, take part of the hair from the section you set aside earlier. Add a small amount of the <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/kenra-platinum-shaping-creme.html" target="_blank">Kenra Platinum Shaping Creme 7</a> for a little extra hold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a loop shape and push that loop through the bobby pin, pulling gently. Remove the bobby pin and continue this pattern along the right section of hair. This will give you that beautiful bow shape! Once you’ve finished five or six bows, tie the ends of the braided sections together with an elastic. While this is a more advanced braided hairstyle, it looks absolutely gorgeous when it’s finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Katniss Everdeen’s Forehead Braids With Loose Curls</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Katniss-Forehead-Braid.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31626" alt="Katniss Forehead Braid" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Katniss-Forehead-Braid.png" width="286" height="376" /></a> If Prim’s hairstyles are a little too challenging for your skill level, don’t worry! This next braided look is much simpler. Remember when Katniss and Peta attended the Victory Tour in the Capitol? Even if you don’t remember the scene, you are sure to remember Katniss’ incredible hair do. It featured a 7-strand braid with loose, sophisticated curls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the same look (but a little less complex), start by curling your hair. You’ll want lots of volume (try the <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/volumizing-tonictm-spray.html" target="_blank">Brocato Volumizing Tonic Spray</a> for a little extra boost) and big, sexy curls. After your hair is completely curled, take a large section from the front right part of your hair. Flip that section over and start braiding it toward the left. Do the same thing on the other side, taking hair from the left, flipping it over, and braiding it toward the right. (Confused? Think of this as an altered version of a <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/10/02/diy-do-easy-braided-crown-tutorial/" target="_blank">braided crown</a>!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished the braided sections, cross them over one another to create those Katniss inspired forehead braids. Pin them into place with bobby pins. Make sure that all of your braids are secure and you’re done! The rest of your hair should be left down so that it looks loose and curly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you love The Hunger Games? Then show off your fan status by wearing one of these unique braided styles. Whichever one you choose, your hair will look hotter than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the love of hair,</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with showing your hair dresser how much you care, especially if you've been acquiring their beauty services all year. With that said, here are three gifts that will allow you to give<em> beauty</em> back to your stylist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Perfume Sampler Set</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_31579" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:610px;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bond-no-9-gift-set.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-31579" alt="This Bond No. 9 gift set is available at Nordstrom." src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bond-no-9-gift-set.jpg" width="600" height="920" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">This Bond No. 9 gift set is available at Nordstrom.</p>
</div>
<p><strong></strong> Opting to give a sampler set over one fragrance bottle is a wonderful option, especially if you aren't sure what type of scents your stylist really likes. This is also a great gift for someone who enjoys variety, maybe smelling light and flowery one day and then embracing a piney musk the next. Also, many samplers come in cute carrying cases, so you're <em>giving</em> the bang for your buck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cosmetics Travel Bag</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_31580" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:414px;"><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/C-Wonder-bag.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-31580" alt="This darling makeup bag is from C Wonder... and you can have it monogrammed! " src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/C-Wonder-bag.png" width="404" height="187" /></a>
<p class="wp-caption-text">This darling makeup bag is from C Wonder. It comes in several sizes and you can have it monogrammed!</p>
</div>
<p>Many stylists will meet you wherever you are, whether you are backstage in a dressing room, or at home getting ready for your cousin's wedding. This is why a travel bag for beauty products, tools and makeup would make the perfect gift. If you cannot find a cosmetics organizer that is big enough for hair products, a weekend bag or a small suitcase is a viable option. Keep in mind that your stylist most likely already owns a bag he or she keeps all of their hair supplies in, so try to get them something even more portable and stylish, even if the travel bag is not traditionally for hair and makeup products. Try to match the travel bag with their personal taste as a stylist. Also, focus on finding one that's large enough for their personal belongings and their working tools as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Day at The Spa</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/3-Beauty-Gifts-Your-Hair-Stylist-Will-Love-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31581" alt="3 Beauty Gifts Your Hair Stylist Will Love 2" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/3-Beauty-Gifts-Your-Hair-Stylist-Will-Love-2.jpg" width="1000" height="667" /></a></p>
<p>Everyone deserves a little pampering, and your stylist is no different. Treat them to a spa day so they can be the one "in the chair" for a change. Massages, pedicures, and manicures are usually included in a spa day service, but these services make great gifts individually. You can also give them a gift certificate to a salon (different than the one they work for) so they can pick and choose the services they want.</p>
<p>Another option is to make your own "spa day package" and include some of your favorite beauty products. Luxurious shampoos like <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/paul-mitchell-teatree-special-shampoo-10-14-oz.html" target="_blank">Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo</a> and <a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/07/04/5-makeup-products-every-girl-should-own/" target="_blank">beauty basics </a>like primer and lip gloss are the perfect candidates for a huge gift basket full of "spa day" goodies. You can also include a towel, a hair cap and some flip-flops--they may not be too glamorous, but they are still spa day essentials.</p>
<p>You know the famous saying, "treat yourself the way you want to be treated?" Gifts are no exception. If you see something and you love it, odds are your stylist will love it, too. It's fair to say that anyone in the beauty industry loves beauty products, so be creative with your giving and remember that it's the thought that counts!</p>

Not even kidding  - I dropped my ice cream (it takes a lot to make a woman let go of her ice cream). <em>Every week? Are you trying to go bald?</em></p>
<p>Long story short - she actually meant just a regular blowout (where the stylist just washes and dries your hair). The good news is this conversation made me to realize there are a ton of women who have absolutely no idea what a Brazilian Blowout is, why or if they should get one, and even the negative outcomes of the treatment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/5-Things-to-Know-Before-You-Get-a-Brazilian-Blowout.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31583" alt="5 Things to Know Before You Get a Brazilian Blowout" src="http://www.jadabeauty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/5-Things-to-Know-Before-You-Get-a-Brazilian-Blowout.jpg" width="667" height="1000" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong><br />
A Brazilian <a title="Everything You Need to Know About Blowouts" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/26/everything-you-need-to-know-about-blowouts/">Blowout </a>is for women (or men) with frizzy, damaged or processed hair. The blowout, which creates a protective layer around the shaft of hair via a keratin treatment, will leave hair silky smooth and entirely frizz-free (with body and movement though of course).</p>
<p>I know that sounds like your dream come true. Before you make your appointment, educate yourself on to the 5 things you need to know BEFORE you get a Brazilian <a title="Get the Perfect Blowout with Joico’s  Damien Carney" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/11/get-the-perfect-blowout-with-joicos-damien-carney/">Blowout.</a></p>
<p><strong>1. Stylist Certification</strong><br />
Brazilian Blowouts are not part of a regular cosmetology license. I repeat. Brazilian Blowouts are not part of a regular cosmetology license. Stylists attend special training courses to become certified. This means two things: first, you will not be doing your own Brazilian Blowout anytime soon and second, your stylist really has to know her/his stuff to do this right.</p>
<p><em>Tip: Be bold and ASK to see certification before you let some rando stick chemicals on your head. Any respectable, legitimate <a title="The Art of Pricing: What Stylists Need to Consider" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/12/02/the-art-of-pricing-what-stylists-need-to-consider/">stylist </a>will be glad to provide you with this information.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>2. Danger Zone</strong><br />
Anytime you are working with chemicals, there is going to be that eerie dread of danger. In particular, Brazilian Blowouts generally contain Formaldehyde, which is used as a preservative in the Science world. The justification for the chemical is that it can modify the hair protein, making it smooth and frizz free. So, this is one of those cases where you need to sit down with your stylist and talk thoroughly about the risks of the chemicals, as well as his/her qualifications and confidence in their success.</p>
<p><strong>3. If It's Cheap, Run</strong><br />
This treatment lasts 10-12 weeks and usually costs anywhere from 150-500 dollars. If you see a sign that says "$25 Brazilian Blowouts," please, please, please run far away from that <a title="Babershops vs. Salons: What’s so Different?" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/11/29/babershops-vs-salons-whats-so-different/">salon</a> and never look back.</p>
<p><strong>4. Color-Treated Hair, Yay or Nay?</strong><br />
If you have color-treated hair (highlights or full color), stylists unanimously say - go for it! The point of the blowout is to correct damage, including that caused by coloring. We still recommend mentioning to your stylist a history of hair coloring, so you can decide together the best step for you to take.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you have allergies?</strong><br />
I don't mean "I sneeze in<a title="Hair vs Climate: 20 Life-Saving Hair Products For 5 US Regions" href="http://www.jadabeauty.com/beautybuzz/2013/09/25/the-best-hair-products-for-your-climate/"> Spring</a>" allergies. I mean, do you wear dog tags of all the things you are allergic to? If so, please be informed that Brazilian Blowouts have caused a lot of allergic reactions in women. This would be a conversation you need to have with an actual doctor, not your stylist.</p>
<p>What do you think - are you going to try out a Brazilian Blowout?</p>
<p>For the love of hair,<br />

<p>We love a girl who isn't afraid to rock a fierce pixie, and writer Sarah Lee's cut (reminiscent of a 1960s Mia Farrow) is nothing but chic. She shows off her hair and style on her blog <a href="http://sanfranista.me/">Sanfranista</a>, where she chronicles her life as a writer in San Francisco. Read on for more about how she decided to take the short cut plunge, the accessory she rarely takes off, and where you can find her on a Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you live and play? </strong>I'm a San Francisco girl through and through! I was born in the area and am now based in Pacific Heights, but I love to explore all over San Francisco and the Bay Area. Favorite areas right now include Jack London Square in the East Bay, Napa in the North Bay, and the Mission District in San Francisco.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How would you describe your style when it comes to hair?</strong> I've become a bit of a one-trick pony ever since I've had my pixie cut- I usually just straighten and smooth out the cut, pushing my bangs to the side. However, I like to have some fun when I go out and will go for a messy look or even a fauxhawk!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>We love the pixie! Almost everyone we talk to says they love the look but are scared to try it themselves. How long have you had a pixie cut? What made you take the plunge? </strong><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Why, thank you! It really is amazing how many women stop me on the street and say that they wish they had a pixie cut. While I'll admit that the look isn't for everyone, there are so many versions of a short cut that I'm confident most women can pull off the look. The key for me was finding a fantastic stylist who knows what works well with my face shape and lifestyle- I've tried different versions of the cut with her, and I'm always confident that she'll let me know what will look best on me.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I've had the pixie since 2006, and it's hard to remember a time when I had long hair! I have naturally curly hair, and I used to wear it very long (think Disney princess). I always wanted to cut it, but it wasn't until I traveled to India for half a year that I finally made the chop. My hair just felt so out of place and was so high-maintenance in the humid weather, and I wanted to make a physical change to reflect the emotional changes I underwent while traveling. Now, I couldn't imagine life without it!</span></p>

<p>It's kind of a fun story- my husband and I had just moved to San Francisco, and we used to go on these walks for hours where we'd explore around the city and get to know the area. We were walking through Pacific Heights one evening, and I noticed a gorgeous building with all these floor-to-ceiling windows with warm light spilling out of them. When I peeked in, everyone looked so friendly and chic, so I quickly typed "Renaissance Salon" into my phone and saved it! I called them up a few weeks later, and my stylist Danielle happened to be the only stylist available for a cut that day. She was still in her training program, so I wound up being her first regular client! I've seen her for over three years now, and when you have a pixie, that means once a month! It's been so cool to see her technique develop even further, although I still maintain that my first haircut with her was the best one I'd ever up until that point.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What products can you not live without?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Since my hair's very thick and wavy, I always use a light smoothing serum when I blow-dry my hair to get a sleek look. I like to use a light styling wax and pomade to give my hair some texture, and I always use hairspray! I quickly learned that skipping hairspray in this San Francisco fog is very unwise.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What's your biggest frustration with your hair?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Ever since I went from my natural ash blonde to platinum a few months ago, I've found that I need to be religious about going in for trims and color. I used to be able to go eight weeks or so and just rock a shag between cuts, but no longer! I love my cut and color so much that it's worth it, but I'm pretty grateful that my salon is only a few blocks away from my apartment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Any hair idols?</strong></p>
<p>I love how Michelle Williams rocks a slightly longer pixie, and I'm a huge fan of Agyness Deyn's bold platinum style. Emma Watson totally nails the super-short pixie while still looking so gorgeous and feminine, so I'm always pinning her hair and makeup looks for inspiration.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How would you describe your overall style? </strong>I'm kind of an odd hybrid of super-feminine and edgy- one day I'll be wearing leather pants and a men's flannel shirt with huge black boots, and the next day I'll switch to a cute white lace dress and ballet flats. I like to play the mod looks that a pixie inspires as well as tougher, more masculine-inspired looks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Where do you find style inspiration? </strong>I know that New York and LA get so much of the street style hype, but there's seriously amazing style happening all over this city! I love meeting local designers and learning what inspires them, and I seriously cannot walk more than a few blocks without taking style cues from a fashionable woman walking down the street. Thrift shopping here is absolutely fantastic- I recently found a pair of vintage Marc Jacobs booties at Goodwill for $8, and I've found everything from Nanette Lapore to Manolo Blahnik to Chanel at a dirt-cheap resale store down the block. Mixing high and low is so fun, especially when your high-end pieces were a bargain to begin with!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What can we find you wearing on a typical day? </strong>A combo of a tunic sweater, leggings, and boots is pretty much my go-to uniform. Layering is so key around here, so I love to be super comfy before I add on sweaters and a scarf. I'm pretty tall and am slightly pear-shaped, so I love to show off my legs!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Any favorite accessories? </strong>I always wear my Marc by Marc Jacobs guitar-shaped watch that my parents gave me for graduation. I also own a dozen different pairs of black booties ranging from combat style to simple suede to a pointy-toed pair covered in glam-rock hardware. You could say that I have a bit of a boot problem.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>San Francisco always seems to have it's own distinct style. How would you describe the style vibe in the city? Does it influence your own style choices? </strong>If I had to pick a phrase, I'd say "anything goes." Even though it's a relatively small city by comparison, there are so many different neighborhoods, each of which has its own distinct style. Of course, there's tons of hippie chic style down in the Haight, and you'll see many more designer labels and classic cuts in the Marina. I wear so many different styles depending on where I'm going and how I'm feeling, but I never feel judged for wearing something a little off-the-wall. So, even though I find inspiration in San Francisco style, I'd say that it influences me the most by letting me feel free to express my personal style!</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Pixie cuts make a big style statement in themselves, but sometimes women who sport them feel the need to play up their style with girlie elements like large earrings and bright lips to still feel feminine. Have you experienced this? Any tips? </strong>Oh, I've definitely fallen into the lots-of-eye-makeup trap after going for a particularly short cut! I've become much more comfortable going bare-faced in recent years, but I do like to play with the contrast that feminine makeup and a super-short cut can create. I'd say for someone starting out with a pixie, it's important to play around with different makeup and jewelry looks until you find what makes you feel the most confident. It's important to avoid hiding behind too much makeup, which can look forced, so finding a balance is key.</p>

<p><strong>We love that you were brave enough to show your bare face on your blog in a recent post (<a href="http://sanfranista.me/2013/10/03/5-minute-natural-makeup-with-bareminerals/">view it here</a>)! In that post you described your make-up style as pretty low key. What's a typical daily routine like? </strong>Thank you! I will admit, it was a little bit nerve-wracking to put myself out there like that, but it's so important to me to be authentic and relatable in my blog. I do struggle with uneven skin tone and sensitive skin, so I always use a gentle moisturizer and foundation with buildable coverage. I've been getting into blush more recently, so I almost always wear a little around the apples of my cheeks. I skip highlighter for daytime, but I absolutely love it on my cheekbones for nighttime. I fill in my brows with a tinted gel and do a tightline along my upper lashline, which is where you press eyeliner in between your lashes. It's seriously the best makeup tip ever- it makes your lashline look so full without appearing as though you're wearing liner. I finish with a ton of mascara and a light tinted lip balm or gloss. For night, I usually do a smoky charcoal eye or super-bright pink lips!</p>

<p><strong>The person whose hair I’d love to have for a week would be... </strong>Blake Lively. I love my pixie, but that girl's hair is fierce.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The person whose closet I'd love to raid is... </strong>Haha, am I too much of a fangirl if I say Blake Lively again? She nails it and doesn't even work with a stylist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I spend way too much money on… </strong>Fancy drinks at bars! I love trying craft cocktails or a nice glass of sparking wine.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>My purse is never complete without... </strong>Sunglasses.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>My secret beauty weapon is... </strong>Confidence- knowing that even though not everyone may love your look, you definitely do.</p>
<p><strong>My perfect Saturday is... </strong>Sleeping in and brunch with my husband at Jane down the street, followed by a trip to the Ferry Building farmer's market and then dinner and drinks with friends in the Mission.</p>
<p><strong>If I could live anywhere, it would be... </strong>Exactly where I am now, except with a few more bedrooms, a dishwasher, and a balcony ;)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The best advice I've received is... </strong>To never underestimate the power of kindness.</p>
<p><strong>I dream of... </strong>Becoming a style editor for a San Francisco publication.</p>
