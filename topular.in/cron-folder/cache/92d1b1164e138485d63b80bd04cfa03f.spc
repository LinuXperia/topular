<img border="0" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 10px; float: left;"src="http://www.publiusforum.com/images/Obama_IL_licenseplate.jpg" alt="" />In a visit to Southern Illinois, First Lady Michelle Obama noted in a stump speech that Illinois leads the nation in job creation. This is not just political spin, but, based solely on statistics, this is a straight out lie. And where was the media? They have ignored her lies.

Obama was in Illinois to stump for Democrat Congresswoman Cheri Bustos who we hope is beaten by Republican candidate Bobby Schilling in the Illinois 17th District. 

According to the <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/elections/first-lady-exhorts-moline-crowd-to-vote/article_1c81d923-cc48-5d0a-89e6-ce0cf5d37fc9.html"><i>Quad City Times</i></a>, Obama praised Illinois for being a job creator saying, ""And we are here to keep this state in the right direction. And this state is leading the nation in job creation."

As Ulysses Arn helpfully <a href="http://usofarn.com/mooch-falsely-claims-illinois-leads-nation-in-job-creation/">points out</a>, "According to the Senate Joint Economic Committee Illinois added 18,400 jobs in September... By contrast the great state of Texas created 29,200 jobs in September in the same report."

But, as <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2014/07/03/illinois-worst-midwest-private-sector-job-creation/">I even reported earlier</a> this year, Illinois isn't even a job creator among Midwestern states much less the whole nation. In July Illinois ranked as <i>the single worst</i> state in the Midwest for job creation as every single surrounding Midwestern state had created more jobs.

Yet, Michelle says this out right lie from the podium and where is the media to slam her for her blatant lie? Nowhere.

This also proves that Democrats don't care a whit about facts and truth. They simply say whatever they want to, true or not, and no one in the media attacks them for it.

Now, if this were the wife of a Republican President, this lie would have been denounced from coast to coast for days before Election Day, used as a cudgel to hurt Republicans everywhere.

Fulton Street) in Chicago to raise money to help stock orphanage libraries around the world with books for kids. The Bookwallah Organization event will also feature art created by orphan children from India.

"This is one of our most important events of the year," said Bookwallah Founder, Seena Jacob.  "We’re excited to show art inspired by the libraries we’ve already built. It really demonstrates the importance of storybooks in healing and inspiring young minds."

The orphaned children and children with disabilities painted pictures inspired by folktales and their own imagination.  In addition to raising money to fund Bookwallah’s ongoing efforts, the Dream Launcher event is a great opportunity to see and collect one of a kind artwork. A percentage of proceeds will also go the child and orphanage for education expenses. The young “outsider” artist paintings will be accompanied by video and/or photograph explaining his or her inspiration for the piece.

Hosted annually by Chicago couple, Chetan and Karin Ghai, Dream Launcher allows for globally minded individuals to get together and help children whose backgrounds include hearing disabilities, brothels, HIV/AIDS, abuse, girl child abandonment, and other traumatic painful incidents.  WBEZ’s Niala Boodhoo will MC the Dream Launcher event, which will be held on Thursday, September 18th from 6-9pm at Room 1520 (1520 W. Fulton Street) Chicago, Illinois.

Harry Truman once complained he wanted to find a one-handed economist because he was tired of asking a direct question of those on his economic team, only to have them say, “On the one hand … but on the other hand.”

If there was one hand that noted economist Milton Friedman favored, it was the “invisible hand” of the free market.

Today marks the 102nd anniversary of Friedman’s birth. He died in 2006, but during his long career Friedman won over admirers and drove left-of-center critics crazy with his direct and eloquent defense of capitalism.

Friedman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976. But perhaps his greatest influence was nudging people who otherwise may have had little interest in the “dismal science” of economics to look at the world through a new set of eyes and question their assumptions.

<i>The Times of Israel</i> <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/leaflets-threaten-chicago-jews-over-israel-in-gaza/">reported</a> on Monday that the threatening fliers were left on cars in Pulaski Park neighborhood on Chicago's near northwest side. 

Chicago Police Department News Affairs Officer Jose Estrada confirmed the posting of the fliers left on half a dozen cars in the area.

<i>The Chicago Tribune</i> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-antijewish-leaflets-found-on-cars-on-nw-side-20140720,0,5638885.story">told its readers</a>, "According to residents in the area, the leaflets made threats to Jewish people in connection with the conflict in Gaza which began on July 8. The leaflets threaten violence if Israel does not pull out of Gaza, according to residents and police."

The Chicago Police Dept. says it has its hate crimes unit on the case.

These fliers appeared just prior to the <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Protesters-Stage-Die-In-Amid-Gaza-Fighting-267867601.html">"die-in" protest</a> launched in Chicago by terror supporters opposed to the existence of Israel.

The terror supporters began their protest downtown and ended it in front of the Israeli Consulate in Chicago.

Notice that Jews are not parading around the world claiming they are going to attack so-called "Palestinians" in cities like Chicago, New York, Paris, or Berlin. The Israelis are concerned only with the enemy at their gates. 

Meanwhile, Muslims are threatening attacks on innocent people all across the world.

Quite a contrast, there.

As always, Muslims illegitimize themselves with their love of death, murder, and terrorism.

<b>Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Celebrates National Teddy Bear Picnic Day and Ask Alfred </b>

<a href="http://www.millenniumhotels.com/">Millennium Hotels and Resorts North America</a> launched its <a href="http://www.millenniumhotels.com/usa/specials/ask-alfred.html">Ask Alfred Children's Concierge</a> this past Thursday, July 10 in honor of National Teddy Bear Picnic Day. Millennium's British-born Ask Alfred Children’s Concierge made the journey across the pond to help create memories for young guests across the United States. The Ask Alfred Children’s Concierge is an amenity that can be added to any room package for just $15 per child and includes an Alfred cinch bag filled with a selection of goodies, like an exclusive Ask Alfred cuddly Teddy Bear, Surf Sweets® natural and organic Gummy Bears, a crayon activity set by Melissa & Doug®, Alfred’s Lovable Stickables and a set of 12 collectible ‘Color Me’ postcards. In addition, Millennium will donate $2 from each amenity sold to The Dream Factory, which grants the dreams of critically and chronically ill children.

To celebrate the launch of this family program, Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago held a bear soirée of sorts. The hotel hosted an elegant picnic with teddy bear tea sandwiches in the property's historic Crystal Ballroom. With its gold dome ceiling and illuminated dance floor, it served as a magical venue for children to meet celebrity bears like Paddington Bear, Care Bear and Winnie the Pooh. Kids played teddy bear bean toss, danced on the dance floor, took photos with Harry bear (Alfred's cousin), decorated cupcakes and had story time with Paddington and others. 

All in all, it was a beary good time! And, if you're planning to stay at a Millennium Hotel this summer and experience Ask Alfred (there are 14 locations in the US), don't forget to book their <a rhef="http://www.millenniumhotels.com/usa/specials/summer-packages.html">Summer FREEdom package</a> through September 7th, with 15 percent off Best Flexible Rates, up to $50 food and beverage credit, complimentary privileges such as Internet and breakfast for children ages five and under.

(And just to clear up any misunderstandings, I was neither pad for this post, nor did I get anything free to do it.)

As Obama starts shipping tens of thousands of these illegal alien minors all across the nation to be housed in cities everywhere, your tax dollars follow them and some of this money is going to Obama’s pals in liberal organizations and unions to care for these children all paid for by you and me.

Obama is pumping billions of dollars into the feeding and care of hundreds of thousands of illegals who have swamped our southern border expecting--and getting--all sorts of freebies not to mention expecting to become instant citizens. But it isn't just the billions he is spending at the border going on in this mounting crisis. Obama is also billions on these illegals in other parts of the country.

In Illinois, for instance, several left-wing groups, including the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)--all huge supporters of Obama--are getting hundreds of thousands of tax dollars to care for illegals shipped from Texas to the Windy City.

As Illinois Review <a href="http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2014/07/immigrant-children-cared-for-by-group-that-lobbied-for-minimum-wage-hike-and-workers-rights.html">reports</a> "Heartland Alliance (an ACORN-esque organization) is currently under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for nearly $13 million to fund shelter services at Heartland’s nine facilities, which house about 429 of Central American minors that crossed the southwest border without legal guardians."
<blockquote>
The group gets additional funding from the State of Illinois. The Comptroller's office shows over $500,000 going to the group in the past five fiscal years.

Heartland Alliance also receives funding from corporate sponsorships, including from Harris Bank and Boeing.

In their 2012 financial report, Heartland Alliance says it raised and spent $86,793,110. 
</blockquote>
This Heartland Alliance is also teamed up with the Chicago Teachers Union, three SEIU locals and the Chicago Federation of Labor.

You can rest assured this isn't happening only in Chicago. This is going on in every major city in the country.

So, even as Obama is wasting billions at the border he is handing billions more to his buddies in left-wing organizations and unions, billions more of your tax dollars going to waste on illegals and to fill the pockets of Obama’s buddies.

A new poll of likely Chicago voters seems to find that Mayor Rahm Emanuel is in bad shape for his re-election coming up next year. The poll shows that two other candidates are far and away more popular than the incumbent mayor. One of those two is Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, a woman who is nearly an out and proud communist. But, if Chicagoans would vote for Lewis, they don't deserve the vote at all.

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.publiusforum.com/images/karen_lewis_large.jpg"></p>

This new <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> poll <a href="http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/exclusive-poll-karen-lewis-could-give-rahm-run-his-money/mon-07142014-1213am">shows Emanuel losing</a>--and badly--to two other possible mayoral candidates in next year's election. The biggest disparity is that between the mayor and Current Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. She really slams Emanuel beating him 55 percent to 31 percent in the poll.

Preckwinkle has made no moves at all to run against Emanuel and insists she won't. Still, rumors abound that she will throw her hat in the ring, anyway.

To be honest, it really is no surprise that Emanuel is finding low favorables in polling this far out from the election. Mayor Emanuel has failed in many respects as Chicago's mayor. He has done nothing at all to address the mounting pension crisis, spending is still skyrocketing, he's solved none of the mess that previous mayor Richie Daley left him, and worse of all violence in the city has soared to never before seen rates of blood shed.

It might not be surprising if a ham sandwich was leading him.

Now, the second unannounced candidate that beats the mayor is Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis. The poll shows that Lewis beats Emanuel 45 percent to 36 percent.

When the paper called Lewis to let her know of the results she reportedly replied, "Well, first of all, I’m sitting here stunned."

The fact is, we should <i>all be stunned</i> that anyone at all would vote for this hate-filled, near communist who is at the very least an outright race baiter.

For instance, in 2012 Lewis mindlessly threw the race card <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2012/07/26/chicago-teachers-union-president-blames-woes-on-lower-class-and-students-of-color/">and claimed</a> that teachers are now looked down upon because they serve "lower class students" and "students of color." It isn't because they fail to teach, that they demand higher and higher pensions and healthcare benefits even as no one in the private sector get anything close to what they get. No it is because everyone is racist against them.

Even as the city has been drowning in debt, in 2012 Lewis led a teachers strike because her demands of a <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2012/09/10/chicagos-teachers-strike-just-another-corrupt-union-powergrab/">30 percent raise</a> in salary and benefits weren't being met. 30 percent! Who in the private sector ever gets a 30 percent raise?

By 2013 Lewis was going around telling people that <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2013/10/17/chicago-teachers-union-city-belongs-black-people/">Chicago "belongs" to black people</a> and that whites and Hispanics should have no say in what goes on there.

At another speaking engagement in 2014, Lewis said that math should not be taught as a straight subject. Instead <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2014/03/26/chgo-teachers-union-chief-wants-math-corrupted-social-justice-propaganda/">math should be coupled with left-wing "social justice" propaganda</a> to get kids' minds right.

And Lewis' socialist/communist styled ideas are fully embraced by her vassals in the union, too. In 2013 <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2013/08/08/chicago-public-school-teacher-attacks-capitalism-says-violent-revolution-coming/">Chicago teacher Tim Meegan</a> gave a speech rife with communist buzz words and insisted that a violent revolution ala the revolution that ushered communism into Russia in the last century was coming unless people adopted his left-wing ideas.

In 2012 <a href="http://www.publiusforum.com/2012/11/16/chicago-teachers-union-co-sponsor-of-socialist-program/">the CTU was also a sponsor of a socialist program</a> called the "Social Justice Curriculum Fair."

Despite all this wholly un-American stuff, Chicagoans would vote for Karen Lewis? Seriously? If this is what Chicago would vote for, it seems clear they don't deserve to vote.

A new tabulation of private sector job creation finds that Illinois created a dismal 500 non-government jobs in 2013 making it the single worst state in the Midwest and almost the worst in the country (again).

The Illinois Policy Institute put out its jobs report card recently and found <a href="http://www.illinoispolicy.org/illinois-jobs-report-card/">Illinois to be one of the worst of the worst</a>. It was the worst of the Midwestern region and the second worst in the whole country.

The Ill. Policy Inst. had a disheartening statistic to illustrate this dismal job creation rate. 

"For context," the policy group wrote, "that’s one job for every 300 high school seniors in Illinois, another terrible stretch of job creation for a state that already ranks last in the Midwest for job recovery from the Great Recession."

The next worst in the Midwest was South Dakota with 1,500 jobs created.

This <i>doesn't mean</i> that Illinois is up 500 jobs, either. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says Illinois lost 26,300 jobs since January.

Here is the latest list of stories showing that Illinois is the worst of the worst in the country, all thanks to the Democrats, House Speaker Michael Madigan, and Democrat Gov. Pat Quinn:

I have been made aware that the great Jack Roeser passed away last night. This is a great loss to conservatism in Illinois, but Jack was in his 90s and in delicate health, so it isn't a surprise, sadly.

Mr. Roeser was very generous with the fortune he built from the ground up as owner of Otto Engineering, a high tech firm located in Carpentersville, Illinois.

Roser was a hard charging conservative and often made folks both left and right mad at him for his choices of causes and candidates, but he was also unapologetic and fearless. In this day and age when people are always mewling and apologizing for their actions, you have to admire a real adult like Roeser making his choices and sticking with them regardless of the "consequences." 

And rarely did he have to face any troublesome consequences, either. He made his decisions and that was that and despite this he was a much sought-after ally in Illinois politics.

Roser was one of the "greatest generation" having served in WWII, but when he came home he didn't turn into one of those liberal pantywastes that gave us the Baby Boomers, or as I call them the worst generation. Roser built wealth, created jobs, and improved his community. He is the sort of man that we should all hold up as an example to our children.

As to his politics, Roeser was there with Reagan and helped fund most of the conservative activism in the state ever since. He was also a great enemy of the teachers unions that have helped destroy our system of education in Illinois. 

Roeser was also the host of a weekend WND talk show as well as the host of <a href="http://www.championnews.net/">ChampionNews.net</a>.

So, rest in peace, Jack Roser. We thank you for you long service to the community. May others seek to emulate your example.

<b>**UPDATE**</b>

Here is a statement on Roeser's passing from ChampionNews"

"Jack Roeser has passed away at the age of 90. While we are saddened by the loss of our leader, we are inspired by his convictions and the spirited battle he fought, seeking to bring change to Illinois. Jack believed in “little government and big people” and lived the American Dream. He will be missed but never forgotten."

Here is a little bio film on Mr. Roeser made not long ago...

<b>**UPDATE No 2**</b>

Washington, DC — U.S. Representative Randy Hultgren (IL-14) released the following statement on the passing of Jack Roeser.
<blockquote>
Christy and I would like to offer our prayers to Jack's family.  Jack was an unsurpassed giant in the conservative movement. He was an expert at translating the principles of conservatism into everyday actions and set the bar high for all of us. His entrepreneurial spirit and business success is a model for those in pursuit of the American Dream. His passion for education reform and ensuring that every child has an equal chance at succeeding was well known. He fought hard for accountability in the school system to ensure that all students received the education they deserved. He never wavered in the cause to ensure that the vision for limited government by our Founding Fathers was observed and respected. Jack will be greatly missed.

That is pretty funny, actually. 

But I can see Lawson's point since about the only good Star Wars film was the first one from 1978! The next two weren't horrible, but the later bunch were just dreck. Junk. Empty, pointless, badly acted, junk.
