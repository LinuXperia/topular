The only “civilized”, industrial leader not providing citizens with health care! Dear Bernie, please do something about medicare and social security benefits. How did our congress vote to give themselves a cost of living raise and not provide for seniors?
I know about the cost of gas business but that makes no sense for seniors. Food prices go up and medication costs go up. Those things matter to seniors but gas prices! I use public transportation.

Despite working fairly decent jobs for a few years none of my employers had to pay me retirement. My husband has a similar story. We are reduced to social security benefits. We had medicare parts A and B but apparently we didn’t sign up for D and so even though our combined prescription needs are less than $20 per month we should have signed up for medication benefits. Since we didn’t, we now have a penalty. Does this make any sense at all????

Now in addition to medicare being deducted we get another deduction for not needing medication. Please Bernie make the wealthy pay their taxes. Stop this country from penalizing the less fortunate and dooming us retirees to subsistence living. We worked but just don’t make enough from social security to have even a marginally comfortable retirement. Forget living in a retirement community with a golf course. We can’t afford food or needed prescriptions.

My family story is not nearly as bad as some I have heard. One of our neighbors can not afford her diabetes medication. In the words of the unreformed Scrooge, she should just die and rid the rest of us of her dependance. It doesn’t matter that she is a wonderful woman who takes the time to work in her church or help seniors less able than she to get groceries.

Bernie, the other day I talked to a hispanic man who explained to me that he planned to vote for Ben Carson because Dr. Ben is a 7 Day Adventist and a minority. This poor man was clueless until I informed him that dear Dr. Ben would most likely wish to ship him and his 7 Day Adventist family back to Mexico. So while you are campaigning please let minorities know how you have fought for rights for everyone. Please make sure people understand that capitalism without socialism is fascism.

I’m going to do my part. My next blog will be about the Democratic National Convention attempting to push Hillary Clinton down our throats. I’ve been trying to explain to any of my skeptical friends that you can win. We just need to educate enough people and get out the vote. Of course my friends say that they will vote for whoever is on the Democratic ballot but thats no more informed than voting for Ben Carson because he is a 7 Day Adventist minority.

It’s no secret that I’ve been a supporter of cannabis for many years. This past October I spoke in San Francisco at the social capital markets conference on the topic of using the huge revenue stream to support social causes like providing scholarships for those released from prisons for minor drug offenses.

&nbsp;

It may not be a well-known fact but felons (and in most states marijuana possession is still a felony) cannot receive federal benefits like food stamps, public housing, Social Security and Federal loans or grants. The latter is one of the reasons our not for profit got so involved in the fight to legalize marijuana.  Most people are aware that finding employment is very difficult for ex-offenders.

&nbsp;

So here we have a perfect set up for continual incarceration starting with getting busted for pot. John D. gets picked up at the age of 18 for having pot on his person. John D. is a minority. He dropped out of school even though his teachers label him as “brilliant”. John D. is sentenced as a felon. He does his time and while in prison he gets interested in quantum physics. He really is a genius. Tough for John D.  Unless some foundation or private institution provides him with funding, John will not become the PhD to solve a major quantum physics problem.

&nbsp;

True this is stretching the story line. There probably are not a lot of future physicists locked up but there are many teachers, lawyers, computer technologists, future law abiding husbands, fathers, mothers etc. in this situation.

Point of fact John D. and his cohort can’t legally become teachers or childcare workers. They can’t join the military. They are ineligible for most jobs requiring a license. Basically the doors to having possibilities are closed, slammed. This should be the real crime!

&nbsp;

Fortunately a few states are righting the wrong.  Alaska for example has restrictions on the amount of cannabis and the intended use. Is it personal use or did the person intend to sell it? Four ounces or more and you’re going to jail with a felony rap for five years.  In California if you sell any amount it’s a felony. Cultivating gets you a felony rap. Even in Colorado intent to sell or distribute over five ounces is still a felony and if you have fifty pounds or more, it’s hasta la vista baby for 32 years. It would be rather hard to justify a personal stash of 50lbs. In our nation’s capital personal use and possession of  6 plants and you’re over 21 is ok. The same applies if you have less than 2 ounces and you are over the age of 21. The laws vary in every state.

The bottom line remains that the Federal government needs to step up and right this wrong. The war on drugs is a failure if the intent was to curtail drug use. If it was meant to feed the prison industrial complex, it works.

It's the one place I can talk about social investing and people don't look at me like I'm speaking Martian. The SoCap is the largest conference of its type. In fact over 2500 investors and entrepreneurs  gathered at Fort Mason on the Bay. So for the majority of people out there who didn't attend SoCap or have any idea what the heck is social impact investing, here is a very brief primer.

People with money (usually lots of money, foundations and some corporations) decide that they would like to make more money by receiving a decent return on their investment and they would like to see some social good come from their investment. I know this is a tough concept. So look at it this way.

You are Nick Hanauer, a bona fide capitalist. You've done a video that explains that you can only buy so many houses, so many cars and so many pairs of nice pants and you still have oodles of disposable income. You wake up one morning and decide that for your own good and the good of the world something needs to be done that improves life on this rock. So you talk to a broker who tells you that there is a company that will take your investment dollars; provide a good return on your money and in the interim will build schools in poor communities, or erect solar farms, or train rural farmers in Peru to grow asparagus and quinoa while providing a decent living for 3000 people! That's social investing.

So enjoy this 12 minute video of yours truly talking about cannabis for good!

It’s about dollars and the influence of the fossil fuel industry on Capitol Hill. Who cares about climate reality or our responsibility for the demise of the earth. The Pope.

It’s particularly interesting how so many Republicans want to use the bible to annihilate women’s reproductive rights but fail to use the bible to defend human rights and environmental rights. Of course they find certain passages that they claim support their beliefs but the real proof in the pudding is examining the source of their PAC funding and lobbyist intervention. It’s absolutely a matter of payola.

Pope Francis came out today in support of climate change and the effect on the climate by human activities. Jeb Bush quickly stated that he doesn’t take economic advice from his bishop and to quote:  “I think religion ought to be about making us better as people, less about things [that] end up getting into the political realm.” Wow, that is a true BUSH WACK statement.  Hey Jeb, we can’t be better people if fossil company greed, political pay outs and corporate corruption are killing the planet. The most affected by our insane misuse of the planet are the poor.

It’s pretty clear that the wealthy (not all of them) are waiting for the bubbles to enclose their enclaves and leave the rest of us gasping for air and living with open sewers and endemic plagues and no potable water. So, it seems perfectly reasonable that the head of the Roman Catholic Church should shoot the climate deniers right between the eyes.
