<p>I was surprised by how much I like the <em>101 Easy Asian Recipes</em> book that was published by Lucky Peach last year. I am ambivalent about the magazine, in which I find both brilliance and bro-ness, but the book doesn&#8217;t have any of the tone-baggage that the magazine sometimes suffers from. As the title promises, it is a collection of genuinely easy to prepare Asian recipes. The authors (&#8220;Peter Meehan and the editors of Lucky Peach&#8221;) gave themselves two rules when creating recipes for the book, no deep frying and no recipes containing sub-recipes (as in, a recipe that requires you to execute multiple other recipes to complete). It is informative and breezy. I especially like the guide to ingredients at the front of the book. It is the kind of book I will cook from a lot. In fact, I already have and have liked every recipe I tried.</p>

<p>I especially like this simple celery salad that is easy to prepare and a nice compliment to a main course, especially a heavy, meaty one. It is fresh and spicy and keeps for a couple of days in the fridge. I also like this recipe because it encouraged me to get a jar of spicy chili crisp (the lid of which is pictured above—I love her attitude problem), which is a condiment that I now hope to always have in my fridge.</p>
</div>
<div>On a totally unrelated note: Some of my best travel recommendation have come from you, my dear readers. We&#8217;re headed to Iceland in a couple of months—Reykjavik and the West and South coasts. We are looking for all of your best places to eat/drink/shop/etc.. Comment? Shoot me an email? Would appreciate your advice.</div>

<p><strong>Spicy Cold Celery</strong> (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Peach-Presents-Asian-Recipes/dp/0804187797"><em>Lucky Peach Presents 101 Easy Asian Recipes</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon spicy chili crisp or chili oil</li>
<li>4-5 large celery stalks, sliced thinly on an angle (about 2 1/2 cups)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stir together the soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, sugar, and chili crisp is a medium bowl until sugar dissolves. Add the celery and toss to coat it in the dressing. Let stand for a few minutes before eating. This will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, so you might as well make a double batch.</p>

<p>I am currently living like the one percent.</p>
<p>Usually I dismiss $65 jars of honey or spice blends when I see them written up in publications. I am naturally skeptical and also aware of the PR machine that drives most food journalism these days, so I assume the products are bullshit. Except for when I don&#8217;t. Like when I pay $50 (DOES. NOT. INCLUDE. SHIPPING.) for a panettone because Charlotte Druckman told me to. Druckman appreciates a good pastry more than most people and her <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/t-magazine/food/panettone-valentines-day-roy-shvartzapel.html">NY Times article</a> convinced me this was an important financial investment. Also, I was able to use the excuse of Valentine&#8217;s Day to justify this as a gift to myself (and Bryan, I guess).<span id="more-15724"></span><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15729" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC00571-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00571" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Well, the posh panettone arrived from the kitchen of pastry chef <a href="http://www.thisisfromroy.com/">Roy Schvartzapel</a> yesterday. I cannot overstate the wonders of this panettone. It is the <em>actual, literal</em> Best. I have eaten many panettones in my day, and some of them I genuinely enjoyed and none of them, in retrospect, came anywhere near this amazing loaf of gluten and sugar-filled magic. It is both incredibly rich and light as a feather. The additions to the dough (in my case, pistachios, raspberries, and milk chocolate) are of the highest quality. The crunchy sugar clinging to the dome is a dream. It is perfect and is truly worth every penny. Roy, you&#8217;ve convinced me. <em>Will buy from seller again</em>. I love you.</p>
<p>But can we talk about the packaging? At first I was like, cool—nice packaging! Then I realized how much the packaging looks like fragrance packaging from the 90&#8217;s, like some knock-off Calvin Klein fragrance. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. But then I started to read the packaging and Roy started to make me a little nervous. He gets kind of intense:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15731" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC00591-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00591" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15733" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC00600-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00600" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15732" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC00593-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00593" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Gotta love his passion, though!</p>
<p>So, I am here to help empower you to spend your paycheck on a panettone. Because you&#8217;re worth it. Also, they keep for two three weeks so you can be eating this for a while. Also, Valentines Day. Actually, now that I think of it, the best person to buy one is a single person who lives along because you get to eat all of the bread yourself. Bryan, unfortunately, thinks he is entitled to half of mine.</p>
<p>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day, friends!</p>

<p>Chicago has something called the <a href="http://grandchefsgala.com/chicago/">Jean Banchet Awards</a>, which are described on their website as &#8220;the only Chicago-based award ceremony recognizing culinary distinction in the <span style="color: #444444;">Chicagoland area&#8221;. That is all you really need to know about the awards for our purposes, other than the fact that they recently added a category called &#8220;Best Ethnic Restaurant&#8221;. I looked to see if I could find a description of what the organization thinks an &#8220;ethnic restaurant&#8221; is, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything. I guess it goes without saying. It is particularly confusing because restaurants like Momotaro (Japanese), The Radler (German), </span>Osteria Langhe (Italian) <span style="color: #444444;">are not nominated in the &#8220;ethnic restaurant&#8221; category but rather in the &#8220;best restaurant&#8221; category. If they are not &#8220;ethnic restaurants&#8221; then &#8220;ethnic&#8221; must be code for something else.</span></p>
<p>Ugh.<span id="more-15701"></span><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>This struck me because recently I have been cooking a lot of ethnic food at home—just kidding, I have been cooking a lot of Chinese, Lebanese, and Mexican food. (see how I was specific there?) And I always feel a little self-conscious when I share those recipes with you—I am not an expert and don&#8217;t want to mistakenly present myself as one. (We currently are experiencing a cultural moment when legions of anglos consider themselves experts on Middle Eastern food because they own an Ottolenghi book. Guess what, you didn&#8217;t discover za&#8217;atar, Becky.) I think food can be a great way to learn about cultures other than your own, but only if you put in the work.</p>
<p>I guess what I am saying is that I wish more people felt self-conscious before they opened their mouths, or invented awards.</p>

<p>My recent kitchen projects have been inspired by some cookbooks I received as gifts over the holidays. One of my favorites was <em>The Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook</em>, it is sort of like the Epcot Center of bread cookbooks. The subtitle is <em>Artisan Baking from Around the World</em>! (I&#8217;m not sure if there is actually an exclamation point, but it feels right). It contains recipes for everything from injera to parker house rolls which could be a real disaster but somehow works here. It is also a book about the organization&#8217;s mission. <a href="https://hotbreadkitchen.org/">Hot Bread Kitchen</a> is a bakery in New York &#8220;that employs and empowers immigrant women, providing them with the skills to succeed in the culinary industry.&#8221; (got that from the publisher, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hot-Bread-Kitchen-Cookbook/dp/0804186170">here</a>) The cover image is of two loaves of Nan-e barbari, which I learned is a Persian flatbread. Flat-ish bread? It is from a chapter called &#8220;Slightly Elevated&#8221; that covers leavened flatbreads.  I suspect my barbari had a bit too much rise, I think it is supposed to be flatter. But it was delicious nonetheless, and made for a nice lunch with a platter of onions, parsley and feta.</p>

<p><strong>Nan-e barbari</strong> (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hot-Bread-Kitchen-Cookbook/dp/0804186170"><em>The Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups/450 g lukewarm water</li>
<li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>4 cups/510g bread flour, plus more for shaping</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>canola oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1/3 cup/80g cool water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon nigella seeds</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Stir together the water and yeast in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.</p>
<p>Add the bread flour and salt and mix on low speed until the flour is integrated. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough is elastic, about 6 minutes. The dough should be cleaning the sides of the bowl. Coat the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and transfer the dough to it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature until the dough is supple and holds an indentation when pressed lightly, about 1 hour.</p>
<p>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide the dough in half, Gently form each piece into a log. Loosely cover the pieces of dough with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature until the dough has risen, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the all-purpose flour, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon canola oil, and the water in a small saucepan. Cook the flour paste over medium heat, whisking, until bubbles form around the edges and it becomes thick and opaque, about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Put a pizza stone on the lowest rack of the oven and preheat to 450°F.</p>
<p>Line the back or a backing sheet with parchment. Put one piece of dough on the parchment.; leave the other covered and in a cool place. Gently pulling the ends and pressing down on the dough, extend it into a 14&#215;5-inch rectangle. Using your fingers, press 5 deep lengthwise ridges into the dough, being sure not to bread the dough. Rub half of the flour paste over the surface and sprinkle with half of the nigella and sesame seeds.</p>
<p>Slide the dough and parchment onto the hot stone and bake until the bread had puffed up and is golden brown, about 18 minutes. Transfer the loaf to a wire rack, dispose of the parchment, and repeat the process to make the second loaf.</p>

<p>A friend recently posted <a href="http://qz.com/569143/christmas-gift-giving-between-adults-is-a-needless-consumerist-chore/">this article</a> on Facebook that addressed the difficulties of Christmas gift giving between adults, which is something Bryan and I have been discussing a lot. As people who are celebrating the secular side of Christmas, we&#8217;re struggling to figure out what that means now that we&#8217;re all grown up. As kids with little or no financial power of our own, gifts were the greatest thing ever (we also weren&#8217;t as smart as kids, so surprises were easier). I think we hold on to the hope that gifts will still feel the same, but they usually don&#8217;t. And while I still give and enjoy receiving some gifts, I am trying to find other ways to show my friends and family I care. Baking is one of those ways.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15684" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC003911-520x337.jpg" alt="DSC00391" width="520" height="337" /></p>
<p>Occasionally, I like to throw a real project of a recipe at you, especially at this time of year when you don&#8217;t have anything else going on. I have wanted to try this <em>Torta della Nonna</em> recipe since I first got <em>The Mozza Cookbook</em> (which remains a favorite cookbook of mine), but I have been a little reluctant because the recipe spans 3 or 4 pages of the book and sometimes even I<em> just can&#8217;t</em>. But I did finally try it, and am here to encourage you to do the same. It might be just the place to channel some of your gift-giving energy, and what better gift than sitting around a table eating a pastry with friends?<span id="more-15674"></span></p>
<p>This is essentially a cheesecake in tart form, and before you cultural purists start to comment—Silverton admits this is not a traditional version of the torta. This version starts with pasta frolla, which is an Italian pastry dough. The main distinguishing characteristic, as far as I can tell, is that there are a bunch of egg yolks added to the dough. The result is a dream to use, easy to roll out and move around. The filling is a cheesecake batter that employs, in addition to the decidedly American cream cheese, some fresh goat cheese and mascarpone. Because it is a restaurant recipe, it adds some flair through cookies (made with the same pasta frolla) that top the torta as well as a little plating pizzazz in the form of pools of honey and a scattering of pine nuts. The end result is a dessert worthy of a New Years or Christmas Eve dinner. Or you can eat it on a random Tuesday night, as we did.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15675" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00319-520x330.jpg" alt="DSC00319" width="520" height="330" /></p>
<p>One of the wonders of the recipe is that the dough and filling can be made a day (or more) in advance and stored in the refrigerator. I suggest you do this, to make things easier and less stressful. If you don&#8217;t have a flan ring, I am sure you can use a fluted tart shell with a removable bottom, though I haven&#8217;t tried. The recipe calls for an Italian leavening I had never worked with, but found at a local Italian market. It is not necessary, and Silverton provides an alternate suggestion, but it is always fun to find and work with new ingredients.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15676" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00333-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00333" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>I hope the year ends well for all of you, and I look forward to more fun in 2016. xo</p>

<p><strong>Torta della Nonna</strong> (recipe from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mozza-Cookbook-Angeless-Restaurant/dp/0307272842">The Mozza Cookbook</a></em> by the incomparable Nancy Silverton and <a href="https://carolynncarreno.wordpress.com/">Carolynn Carreño</a>)</p>
<p>Crust:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
<li>3/4 cup confectioners&#8217; sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup (1 stick) cold, unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon Italian leavening, such as Bench Mate, Pane Angel or Rebecchi (or sub 1/8 tsp baking powder and 1/8 tsp baking soada)</li>
<li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
<li>4 extra-large egg yolks</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (only if NOT using Italian leavening)</li>
<li>1 extra-large egg white</li>
<li>1/3 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
</ul>
<p>Filling:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 ounces cream cheese</li>
<li>1 cup mild-flavored fresh goat cheese</li>
<li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>1/4 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>3 extra-large eggs</li>
<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 1/4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<p>To serve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two types of single-flower honeys (I used buckwheat and clover)</li>
<li>Honeycomb (I didn&#8217;t use this, but it would be nice</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the crust, combine the flour, confectioners&#8217; sugar, butter, leavening, and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and mix on low speed until the butter and dry ingredients form a coarse cornmeal consistency, about 2-3 minutes. Add the egg yolks and vanilla, if you are using it, and mix on medium speed until the dough is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Dust a flat work surface with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough for a minute or two until it comes together into a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour and up to three days.</p>
<p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, butter the inside of an 11- inch flan ring, and place the ring on the baking sheet.</p>
<p>Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Dust a flat work surface with flour, cut the dough into chunks, and knead the dough on the work surface to soften it, until it is the texture of Play-Doh. Cut off a 1/3 cup portion (about 3.2 ounces) of dough, wrap it in plastic wrap and return it to the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Dust your work surface and rolling pin with flour and roll the dough out to 2 inches larger than the ring, and to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Gently fold the dough in quarters and place it on top of the flan ring, placing the point in the center and gently unfolding the dough so the ends are flopped over the ring. Gently push the dough down to fit inside the ring, pressing into the crease around the inside circumference so the dough fits snugly against the corners and sides. (Don&#8217;t stretch the dough to fit or it will shrink during baking.) Dip the knuckle of your index finger in flour and use it to press the dough into the crease to create a straight edge, not sloping sides. Roll the rolling pin over the top of the flan ring to cut the dough. Pull off the trimmed dough and discard (I saved this dough until I was done, in case I needed it). Place the tart shell in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes and up to one day.</p>
<p>Remove the 1/3 cup of dough that you had set aside from the refrigerator and place it between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll it into an 8-inch circle about 1/16 inch thick. Place the dough sandwiched between the parchment paper on a baking sheet and put it in the freezer to chill until it is firm but not frozen, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Adjust the oven rack so it is in the lowest position and preheat the oven to 350°F and line another separate baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p>Remove the sheet of dough that you rolled very thinly from the freezer, lay it on a flat work surface, remove the top sheet of parchment paper, and use the 8-inch ring to cut a circle out of the dough, working quickly so that it stays cold. Pull away and discard the scraps of dough around the circle and cut the circle into eight or ten equal (I did 8 but think 10 is better) wedges as you would a pie—however many servings you want the tart to make. Still working quickly, use a metal spatula to carefully lift the wedges one at a time and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each. Brush the wedges with the egg white. Scatter 2 tablespoons of the pine nuts over the wedges, dividing them evenly, and gently press the nuts into the wedges to make sure they adhere; reserve the remaining pine nuts for serving with the tart.</p>
<p>Bake the wedges until they&#8217;re golden brown, about 8-10 minutes, rotating the pan in the middle of the baking time so the cookies brown evenly. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place it on a wire cooling rack until the wedges cool, and dust them lightly with powdered sugar.</p>
<p>To make the filling, combine the cream cheese, goat cheese, butter, and mascarpone in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed until the ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and salt, mix on low speed to incorporate, and transfer to a large mixing bowl.</p>
<p>Combine the eggs and sugar in the same bowl you mixed the cheeses in. (There&#8217;s no need to wash the bowl.) Exchange the paddle attachment for the whisk attachment on your mixer and beat the eggs and sugar together until the eggs are thick and fluffy and the sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add the vanilla and beat just to incorporate. Gently fold one- third of the egg mixture into the cheese, using the flat side of a spatula to smash the cheese and break up the density of the cheese with the egg. Add another third of the egg mixture, folding it in with a light hand so the eggs stay light and fluffy. Fold in the remaining egg mixture, mixing until the ingredients are combined but there are still visible lumps of cheese in the mix. (The filling can be made up to four days in advance. Transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate until you are ready to bake the tart.)</p>
<p>Remove the tart shell from the refrigerator and pour the filling into the shell to fill it 1/8 inch from the top. (You may not use all of it but you don&#8217;t want to overfill the ring; discard the excess.) Place the baking sheet with the tart on it in the oven to bake for about 40 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through the baking time for even browning, until the filling is set and the top is golden brown. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and set it aside to cool slightly. You can serve the tart warm, or set it aside to cool to room temperature. (To rewarm the tart, place the whole tart or individual slices on a baking sheet and put it in a 350°F oven until it is warmed through; about 5 minutes for slices, about 15 minutes for a whole tart.)</p>
<p>Just before serving, place the cookie wedges on the tart with the outside edges of the cookies about 1 inch from the edge of the tart. Lift the flan ring off the tart. Use a large knife to cut between the cookies, creating even slices using the cookies as a guide. Use a metal spatula to carefully transfer each wedge to a dessert plate. Spoon 1 teaspoon of honeycomb on one side of each wedge. Spoon 1 teaspoon of each of the two honeys into circles about the size of silver dollars on either side of each wedge. Scatter a few of the reserved pine nuts in the center of each pool of honey, but not the honeycomb, and serve.</p>

<p><a href="http://ceciledaladier.com/"><strong>These Ceramics!</strong></a> I have been a little bit obsessed with Cécile Daladier&#8217;s ceramics for a few years now. They are truly weird and wonderful and designed with flowers in mind. They have been sort of difficult to obtain (you used to have to email the studio and it involved a lot of back and forth) but a couple of stores (<a href="http://www.shopanaise.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://alderandcoshop.com/">here</a>) in the states seem to be stocking them more regularly now. Daladier is truly my dream ceramicist. If anyone is looking for a gift for me, send me ALL of these. (Bonus: <a href="http://www.gardenista.com/posts/in-the-garden-and-atelier-with-cecile-daladier-in-paris">her studio!</a>)</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://otherwild.com/collections/by-otherwild/products/the-future-is-female-sweatshirt">This sweatshirt!</a> </strong>Because the future <em>is</em> female, and a percentage of the profits from the sale of this shirt will benefit <a href="https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=12913&amp;12913.donation=form1&amp;_ga=1.87534744.1461772106.1449088303">Planned Parenthood</a>.</p>

For years it was a Swatch, until I found this Casio beauty at <a href="http://tortoisegeneralstore.com/">Tortoise</a>. The watch was inexpensive at Tortoise, but is dirt cheap in other spots making this the Best Watch Ever. It is also a good size for a wide variety of wrists, so really it would be good for almost anyone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coldpicnic.com/rugs/private-parts-2"><strong>This Boob Rug!</strong></a> This has made the rounds on the internet, but I couldn&#8217;t resist including it because it was definitely one of my favorite purchases of 2015. What you maybe can&#8217;t tell from photos is that the rug itself has a really beautiful quality—<em>plush</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15663" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00271-520x367.jpg" alt="DSC00271" width="520" height="367" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60307870/"><strong>This Trivet Set!</strong></a> Honestly, this is one of the most beautiful objects I have come across in a long time, and it cost me all of $10. Maybe the most exciting purchase of 2015.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15617" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00123-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00123" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.aesop.com/usa/">This Aesop Stuff!</a></strong> I can&#8217;t <em>really</em> afford these beauty products, so I feel a bit conflicted about including them—I had a gift card. But holy hell, I love this stuff. The <a href="http://www.aesop.com/usa/skin-care-1/cleanse/fabulous-face-cleanser-2.html">Fabulous Face Cleanser</a> is the best smelling thing ever. I look forward to washing my face every morning. The packaging is too good. I get it, Aesop, I get it. So, maybe take this as a reminder that sometimes it is fun to treat yourself to something completely unnecessary (and hope for a gift card!).<span id="more-15615"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15623" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00209-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00209" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://are-studio.com/products/curve">This ARE Wallet!</a></strong> My friend Ceci makes beautiful things. She started with bags and small leather goods and has recently expanded to clothing. I especially love this leather wallet. I am using it as a secondary wallet (is that a thing?) to store cards that I don&#8217;t use every day (like gift cards!).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15620" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00177-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00177" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong>These New Cookbooks!</strong> A lot of great stuff was published this year, but there are the four that I have especially loved:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookie-Love-Techniques-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/1607746816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449074326&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cookie+love"><em>Cookie Love</em></a> by Mindy Segal and Kate Leahy is truly one of the great baking books. I can&#8217;t stop making these cookies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mamushka-Recipes-Ukraine-Eastern-Europe/dp/1616289619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449074351&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mamushka"><em>Mamushka</em></a> by Olia Hercules is focused on Ukrainian food and absolutely beautiful. It is also refreshing to learn about a new (to me) food culture.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gjelina-Cooking-California-Travis-Lett/dp/145212809X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449074377&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=gjelina">Gjelina</a></em> by Travis Lett is sort of surprisingly wonderful. I find the restaurant a little exhausting, but the book is right on. I especially like the photography by Michael Graydon and Nikole Herriott.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zahav-Israeli-Cooking-Michael-Solomonov/dp/0544373286/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449074429&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=zahav"><em>Zahav</em></a> by Michael Solomonov and Steven Cook is maybe my favorite book of the year. It is like a less fussy version of the Ottolenghi books, and I think the recipes work better. If you care about Middle Eastern food, this is mandatory.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15621" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00178-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00178" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong>These Not-So-New Cookbooks!</strong> These are three of my favorite books that were not published recently:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trout-Caviar-Recipes-Northern-Forager/dp/0873518195"><em>Trout Caviar</em></a> by Brett Laidlaw is a really wonderful book covering foods of the upper Midwest. Low production value is made up for with really great recipes and story telling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Eating-John-Pawson/dp/0609609130/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1449074258&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Living and Eating</em></a> by John Pawson (yes, the minimalist <a href="http://www.johnpawson.com/">designer</a>) and Annie Bell is a strange and wonderful book that is as good to look at as it is to cook from. Why can&#8217;t more cookbooks be cool?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Meal-Cooking-Economy-Grace/dp/1439181888/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449074295&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=an+everlasting+meal"><em>An Everlasting Meal</em></a> by Tamar Adler is one of the only pieces of &#8220;food writing&#8221; that I actually enjoy. In general, writing about food tends to be either really precious or really boring. I stick to cookbooks and the internet. Adler talks to you about cooking in a way that manages to be beautiful, instructive, and humorous without being annoying.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15627" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00242-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00242" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dsanddurga.com/collections/all/products/burning-bazaar">This Burning Bazaar!</a></strong> I know I included their candles last year, but this year they released a limited edition candle (some of the proceeds benefiting Unicef) that they describe as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A fire broke out at the Fabledorf holiday market in 1261. All the wooden toys, cockleshell horns, black pine, clove cellars, and gynger brede burned. A birch table was found, nearly ashes. It smelled like this.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15616" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00115-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00115" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90313153/"><strong>This Pitcher!</strong></a> Sometimes IKEA gets it so right. This ceramic pitcher feels like old Heath ceramics stuff, but for $12.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15664" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00277-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00277" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong>This book called<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Trouble-Spaciousness-Rebecca-Solnit/dp/1595347534/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">The Encyclopedia of Trouble and Spaciousness</a></em> by Rebecca Solnit!</strong> I really enjoy Sonit&#8217;s essay writing (especially <a href="https://www.guernicamag.com/daily/rebecca-solnit-men-explain-things-to-me/">Men Explain Things to Me</a>) and have thoroughly enjoyed this latest collection that covers everything from Icelandic government to interior design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15624" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00210-520x306.jpg" alt="DSC00210" width="520" height="306" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014NK6KQ?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01"><strong>This Fridge Rover!</strong></a> Our nephew has been obsessed with this wind-up magnetic rover (it can climb up vertical metal surfaces) since he was a baby. But his uncles love it almost as much as he does. He broke our first one, so we&#8217;re on to rover 2.0.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15626" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00226-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00226" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://store.dwell.com/microgarden-indoor-garden-kit.html">This Microgarden!</a> </strong>You can grow microgreens in this clever little greenhouse. I&#8217;m having a lot of fun with it, and it would be a good project to share with kids. You&#8217;ll have fancy garnishes all winter long.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15622" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00190-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00190" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><a href="http://soomfoods.com/"><strong>This Soom Tahini!</strong></a> Solomonov uses a lot of tahini in the <em>Zahav</em> cookbook (above), and he recommends Soom. I do too. It is easily the best tahini I have ever had and really worth seeking out.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15665" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC00278-520x347.jpg" alt="DSC00278" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/miracle-peanut-butter-crunch"><strong>This Peanut Butter Stuff!</strong></a> Homemade gifts are the best, except when they&#8217;re the worst. This one is the best. If you like Butterfinger bars, you will love this candy. Make some for yourself, make some for a friend. It is incredibly delicious and so quick to make.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/">This Podcast!</a></strong> Last year I recommended an episode of Death, Sex &amp; Money as a gift to yourself, and I will do it again this year. It is truly one of my favorite things, and Anna Sale is my hero. Her restraint and elegance as an interviewer is unmatched. Two of my favorite episodes from recent months are her interview with <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/sesame-street-maria/">Sonia Manzano</a> (Maria from Sesame Street) and her interview with actress <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/holland-taylor-death-sex-money/">Holland Taylor</a>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As always (because I am physically incapable in engaging in this sort of consumerism without guilt), after reading gift guides I hope we can all acknowledge/remember/appreciate the privilege we share in being able to engage in stuff like this. And then turn that energy into helping someone who needs it, next door or on the other side of the world. We need to work hard to make this world a better, safer, more just and loving place.</p>
<p>xo</p>

<p>I&#8217;m about to leave my thirties behind and a friend (who is only halfway through) recently asked me what I thought of the decade. I liked the last ten years of my life a lot. It was full of milestones: I fell in love and got married, bought an apartment, started a blog (!!!), and became an uncle. It was full of so many good things, and certainly beat my twenties by a mile. But after some reflection, I told her that the only thing I didn&#8217;t love was that the thirties felt like a tough decade for friendships. Many people (myself included, at times) turn away from friends and toward partners, or babies, or their career. Of course there are exceptions and friendships that remained constant. But there is a tendency to become more isolated. The intensity of friendships that I had in my twenties was, for the most part, waning. The spontaneous fun of hangouts, stopping by unexpectedly, watching TV together for hours, or sitting in bars was replaced with <em>dinner in three weeks</em>. It has all become decidedly <em>scheduled</em>.</p>

<p>I recently watched the first season of <em>Doll &amp; Em</em> on HBO. It is a show about a friendship. You don&#8217;t realize how rare and radical that is until you see it in front of you. There are a bunch of shows that claim to be about friendship (most notably, <em>Friends</em>), but mostly they&#8217;re about dating or New York or whatever. <em>Doll &amp; Em</em> is about the beautiful (and sometimes difficult) complexities and value of friendships, and in particular about adult friendships (not a euphemism). I&#8217;ve loved both Dolly Wells and Emily Mortimer for years, and so it was especially satisfying to see them tackle this subject together. The two are real-life friends, and they shine in the series. I laughed, I cried (I actually cried a surprising amount—fair warning) and I can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough. It is a beautiful argument for the importance of working hard to maintain our relationships with friends.<span id="more-15581"></span></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One of my goals in my last year of my thirties was to see as many of my friends as possible—a gift to myself. We&#8217;re spread out all over the world now, so I don&#8217;t get to see everyone nearly as often as I like. But this year, I managed to actually spend time with most of them. It felt  good, and it is the thing I am most thankful for this year.</p>
<p>I fear we don&#8217;t value friends as much as we should in our culture. They take a backseat to a lot of other things. But I wouldn&#8217;t be anything without the friends in my life. So, during this week of giving thanks, I&#8217;m feeling particularly grateful for my friends. If anything, this year (and even <em>Doll &amp; Em</em>) reminded me that friendships are resilient and will bend and shift to accommodate our changing lives. But also, this year reminded me that it is important to make friends a priority and spend time nurturing these relationships, even when we have a million other things competing for our time and attention.</p>

<p>You are undoubtedly busy with turkey and cranberry sauce and pie, at least those of you in the States. But since the internet is now comprised of mostly recipes for those things, I wanted to talk about soup.</p>
<p>Making stock is probably the kitchen task that I feel most overwhelmed and annoyed by. It requires a kind of effort I can rarely muster for something that is usually just a component of something else. But I really like soup, and I really dislike packaged stock, so I am trying to talk myself out of my aversion. I decided to start with vegetable stock, the least creepy of all stocks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve become a big fan of <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/02/hearty-vegetable-stock-vegan-recipe.html">this recipe</a> from Kenji over at Serious Eats. It is really quite delicious and feels worth the effort, which admittedly is small. You don&#8217;t need to follow it exactly, though I think the kombu and mushrooms are important. It is now my go-to stock recipe. As for what to do with the stock you make, how about some toasted quinoa soup?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15584" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_5543-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5543" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>The recipe comes from <em>The Chef Next Door</em> by Amanda Freitag, which a friend sent me a few weeks ago. I&#8217;ll be honest, I didn&#8217;t know who Freitag was—I don&#8217;t live in New York and I don&#8217;t watch food television. But her book has made me fall in love with her a little. Cookbooks by professional chefs are often the worst for home cooks, but Freitag seems to remember what it is like to be in a home kitchen. The recipes all are manageable, but interesting and make you want to get into the kitchen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve become a fan of this vegetable soup with toasted quinoa. It&#8217;s the simplest of things, but lovely in its way. It is obviously adaptable to whatever you have on hand, but really nice as written. It is an antidote to holiday meals and celebration cocktails.</p>
<p>Maybe make a bowl and share it with a friend?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15585" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_5548-520x357.jpg" alt="IMG_5548" width="520" height="357" /></p>
<p>A couple of notes: The small amounts of vegetables called for in the recipe could be easily obtained at a local grocery-store salad bar. My Whole Foods has all of these ingredients available on their bar and it will save you having to figure out what to do with the other half of each vegetable. You could certainly use chicken stock in place of the vegetable, but it seems unnecessary for a chicken to die for this. Serve it with some crusty bread and extra olive oil. It makes about 4 servings.</p>
<p><strong>Toasted Quinoa Soup</strong> (adapted slightly from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chef-Next-Door-Recipes-Fearless/dp/0062345834/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1448307832&amp;sr=1-1">The Chef Next Door</a></em> by Amanda Freitag)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed thoroughly</li>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup diced onion</li>
<li>6 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
<li>1/4 cup small dice carrot</li>
<li>1/4 cup small dice red bell pepper</li>
<li>kosher salt</li>
<li>pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1/4 cup small-diced peeled potato</li>
<li>6 cups vegetable stock</li>
<li>1/2 cup small-diced zucchini</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Spread the quinoa in a thin layer on a rimmed baking sheet and toast it in the oven until it changes color from beige to dark brown, about 30 minutes. Use a spatula to stir it every 10 minutes so that it toasts evenly. Set the quinoa aside.</p>
<p>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, bell pepper, and a generous pinch of salt and cook over low heat for , stirring frequently, for 10 to 12 minutes, until the vegetables have softened. Add the red pepper flakes, rosemary, and cumin and cook for 1 or 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the potato, toasted quinoa, and vegetable stock and stir.</p>
<p>Bring the soup to a boil, then turn down the heat to maintain a simmer, cover and cook for 30 minutes, or until quinoa is cooked. Add the zucchini and cook for 5 minutes more.</p>
<p>Taste the soup and adjust seasoning as needed.</p>

<p>I made this cake twice. The first time I baked in a bundt pan and seriously fucked it up when trying to remove it from the pan. <em>Pieces. Cursing</em>. <em>Why Does everything happen to me? LOL.</em> It was mostly my fault,  I was lazy when preparing the pan. Luckily I was bringing it to by best friend who had just had her second son and wasn&#8217;t going to judge me, she was covered in spit-up. I threw the half I could salvage into a disposable lasagna pan and presented it as the glorious mess it was.</p>
<p>I made it again more recently for the same friend (she really likes malt, and I had something to prove) and this time baked it in a square muffin tin, making cute little individual cakes. I also made the glaze less of a glaze and more of a frosting. I liked it both ways. The cake is full of intense vanilla/malty flavors and feels just right for fall and cool weather and rainy days. It&#8217;s kind of my dream cake. It might be yours, too.</p>

<p>The recipe is from my friend Cara Nicoletti&#8217;s first (hopefully of many!) book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Voracious-Hungry-Reader-Cooks-through/dp/0316242993">Voracious</a></em>. Cara&#8217;s blog, <a href="http://yummy-books.com/">Yummy Books</a>, has long been a favorite of mine. She has great taste, and is a seriously talented writer and thinker.</p>
<p><strong>Scalded and Malted Milk Cake</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>14 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
<li>1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped out and pod reserved</li>
<li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
<li>2 large eggs plus one large egg yolk</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups cake flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon malted milk powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (I used 3/4 teaspoon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Glaze</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons malted milk powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream, or more if needed</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Thoroughly (!!!) grease a bundt pan  (6 or 9-cup, or use a cake pan or a loaf pan or muffin pans).</p>
<p>Pour the milk into a small saucepan and add the vanilla bean pod. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the milk reached 180°F. Once it reaches this temperature, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to steep/cool.</p>
<p>Combine the butter, both sugars, and the vanilla bean seeds in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the eggs and yolk to the butter-sugar mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping the bowl to make sure everything is combined.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the cake flower, malted milk powder, baking powder, and salt.</p>
<p>Remove the vanilla bean pod from the scalded milk. With the mixer on low, alternate adding the dry ingredients and the scalded milk to the butter mixture until everything is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix.</p>
<p>Pour into the greased pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes for the bundt (25-ish for muffin-sized cakes).</p>
<p>Cool the cake in the pan for 30-45 minutes before turning out onto a rack to cool completely.</p>
<p>Whisk all of the glaze ingredients together in a bowl until smooth. You can thin the glaze with additional cream, or thicken it with additional confectioners sugar. Spread the glaze over the cake.</p>

<p>No they won&#8217;t. That&#8217;s ridiculous. But I was finding inspiration in the strangely portentous title of Ruth Reichl&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-no-good-very-bad-year-1443816665">new cookbook</a>.</p>

<p>My friend Abra is a chef and writer and teaches me a lot about how to be a better cook. She&#8217;s especially good at preserving food. I&#8217;ve been following <a href="http://www.abraberens.com/recipe/roasted-cherry-tomatoes/">her lead</a> and roasting and then freezing cherry tomatoes to get me through the long tomato-less winter. (Though maybe <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150620/ISSUE01/306209984/summertime-tomatoes-in-the-dead-of-winter">this winter </a>won&#8217;t be as tomato-less as some for Chicagoans). She also makes a mean <a href="http://www.abraberens.com/recipe/ratatouille/">ratatouille</a>, using those very same roasted tomatoes. I used her recipe to improvise mine, the wine and the paprika are key.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15556" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_5373-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5373" width="520" height="347" /><span id="more-15553"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15557" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_5400-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5400" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been really into this <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/grilled-eggplant-parmesan-grace-parisi">Grilled Eggplant Parmesan recipe</a> that I found on Food &amp; Wine&#8217;s site. We&#8217;ve eaten a lot of eggplant this summer. In part, I think, because I haven&#8217;t been loving the tomatoes I&#8217;ve been getting from the market, even from my favorite sources. Cooking the tomatoes improves them and so this recipe is a good use of the late summer/early autumn abundance of both tomatoes and eggplant. The secret is a layer of chopped olives and peppers. I added a few cloves of chopped garlic to that layer. The recipe is really simple and soothing to make.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15558" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_5465-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5465" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Like many people, I was excited about the release of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NOPI-The-Cookbook-Yotam-Ottolenghi/dp/1607746239">NOPI</a> cookbook. It is a truly beautiful object. I think I will get a lot of inspiration from the book, though to be honest, I am not sure how often I will cook from it. It isn&#8217;t really home cooking, as Ottolenghi admits in the introduction. I made a <a href="http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/tomatoes-with-wasabi-mascarpone-and-pine-nuts-shop">tomato salad</a> with some wasabi mascarpone and quick pickled shallots that was pretty rad. The wasabi mascarpone was a real revelation for me and something I will return to. Basically, mix together some wasabi and mascarpone and season it with salt and pepper. Chives aren&#8217;t a bad addition. Spread it on a tomato. Or a bagel. Or eat it off a spoon.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15559" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_5522-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5522" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Molly Wizenberg is one of the few food writers I trust. When she tells me to make something, I am usually happy with the results. I learned about <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2015/10/as-ever.html">this</a> lemon and coconut cake from her and it is pretty dreamy. I think it is best the first day when the topping has a little crunch, but it keeps well on the counter for a few days.</p>

<p>What have you all been cooking? Any recipe I should know about?</p>

<p>Remember when everyone was eating bacon and bone marrow? I am sure they still are, but we&#8217;re having to hear about it a lot less. The pendulum has swung toward vegetables. Now we hear about rice bowls and fermentation—or we did, maybe even that moment is over. It&#8217;s odd how these trends effect our perception of food. I found myself annoyed by bacon for years. It had become embarrassing. Once the moment has passed, you&#8217;re suddenly trying too hard or something. <em>Those bacon band-aids. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15545" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5301-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5301" width="520" height="347" /><span id="more-15540"></span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we were in Los Angeles and we finally made it to Sqirl. I&#8217;d heard so much about Sqirl that I almost didn&#8217;t need to be there. It was like the time I saw Oprah in person and had a hard time actually <em>seeing</em> her. She looked like television to me. Was she real? Was it any different to see her in person than on TV? Anyway, we sat at Sqirl eating our obligatory rice bowl and brioche toast (which were, of course, delicious) and I found that I was slightly embarrassed of myself. It really felt like I was <em>participating</em>. Participating in food culture, in a moment. Was I trying too hard? Was this real? Why was I there? Does any of this matter? Is that Breckin Meyer?</p>
<p>ps. To those of you who have never heard of <a href="http://sqirlla.com/" target="_blank">Sqirl</a>, I salute you.</p>
<p>pps. It was Breckin Meyer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15543" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5283-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5283" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>When <em>Bon Appetit</em> relaunched they talked a lot about the connection between food and fashion, but only in ways that were literal and uninteresting. It was just #trends or, like, what someone who works in fashion ate for lunch. It&#8217;s too bad, really, because I do think there are interesting connections, and some similar problems, between the two endeavors. If you pay attention to food you notice these trends—you want to puff your grains, dehydrate your carrots, eat burnt things, or drink vinegar. But the trends themselves are the least interesting part of food, and fashion. They are both interesting for the ways they connect with other, more interesting, things like history, politics, color theory, chemistry, ethnicity, etc., and for the ways they tell stories. Alexander McQueen was teaching us a history lesson while telling us a story. Chefs sometimes tell us interesting stories. At their best they inspire curiosity and exploration and engagement. At their best they&#8217;re honest, earnest. They are about life. At their worst, they&#8217;re both disposable, and self-involved, and empty. It is often the media that muddles it and gets in the way of our enjoying it. One of our modern challenges is finding a balanced relationship with media and cultural reporting—too little, and you&#8217;re out of the loop; too much, and you hate everything.</p>
<p>So I continue my personal struggle (portentious!) to maintain a healthy relationship with food and culture—to <em>enjoy it</em>. To accept it for whatever it is and form my own relationship with it.</p>
<p>Today I come to you with an offering, a late summer salad from the NYC cousin of Sqirl, El Rey Coffee Bar &amp; Luncheonette. The salad is a lovely little thing, with jicama, radish, and some pickled plums. It is the sort of salad bowl I like eating in the summer. Earnestly, and without embarrassment. (Free at last!)</p>
<p>Recipe <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/jicama-radish-pickled-plum-salad" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>The plum sauce is good for other things, too. I liked it with tofu.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time trying to convince people in Chicago that Madison, Wisconsin is one of the coolest cities in the country. I get a lot of blank stares or condescending smiles. But if you&#8217;ve been there, you know.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been visiting a couple of times a year for the past few years and have fallen in love with Madison. It is the state capitol of Wisconsin and also home of the University of Wisconsin, which makes it very much a college town. It is a progressive city, sometimes referred to as the Berkeley of the Midwest.  It is built on an isthmus and surrounded by four (five?) beautiful lakes. Nature and urban life flow together in wonderful ways in Madison. It has a thriving food scene and is one of the friendliest places you&#8217;ll ever go. Because it is in Wisconsin, beer and cheese are plentiful. Basically, it is paradise.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15491" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0131-520x390.jpg" alt="IMG_0131" width="520" height="390" /><span id="more-15481"></span></p>
<p>I thought it was time I shared my favorite places with you. This is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to Madison, I&#8217;m not an expert. This is just a listing of the places we like to visit when we are there. I hope it might be useful when you&#8217;re planning your trip. I&#8217;ll try to keep it updated as we try new things, and I am sure people will have their own suggestions in the comments. I really hope it inspires some of you (especially my fellow Midwesterners) to plan a visit.</p>
<p><strong>FOOD + DRINK:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15497" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5508-520x444.jpg" alt="IMG_5508" width="520" height="444" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.forequartermadison.com/#home"><strong>Forequarter</strong></a></p>
<p>Since Forequarter opened, we&#8217;ve never been in town without eating here. I consider it among my favorite restaurants in the world. I know that sounds like a bold claim, but it is true. Restaurants are complex sites that need to bring together good energy, good food, and good people. If it happens right, magic is produced. Forequarter is the ultimate neighborhood restaurant, but they make out-of-towners feel like regulars. The food highlights the best of Wisconsin and the Midwest and is outrageously good. Last year there was a dish of coffee-roasted beets with buttermilk ice cream that blew our minds. I&#8217;m always learning about a new technique or ingredient when I eat here. I&#8217;m also a big fan of their bar. A recent menu featured a cocktail called Great Plains which brought together a burning corn husk, squash juice, and mezcal into something truly exceptional. Forequarter is mandatory. Forequarter is magic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.undergroundbutcher.com/"><strong>Underground Butcher</strong></a></p>
<p>Underground Butcher and Forequarter are both products of <a href="http://www.undergroundfoodcollective.org/">Underground Food Collective</a> (UFC), a collaborative group that promotes sustainable Midwest food and community. As a butcher shop, Underground Butcher is a dream. The butchers are all friendly and charming (and cute) and enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the animals they sell. The shop also sells UFC&#8217;s own outstanding line of charcuterie, under the label of Underground Meats. But the shop is so much more than meat. They also sell a line of housemade preserves and pickles, bakery (including some really delicious cookies and crackers), as well as dairy, alcohol and other pantry items from trusted suppliers. It is the perfect food shop. We stop here on the way home and load up a cooler with delicious food.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15503" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/layla-520x390.jpg" alt="Processed with VSCOcam with a7 preset" width="520" height="390" srcset="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/layla-520x390.jpg 520w, http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/layla-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/layla.jpg 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Laylas-Persian-food-with-a-local-flare/660630290614974"><strong>Layla&#8217;s</strong></a></p>
<p>Layla&#8217;s is unlike any other restaurant. It is a tiny space, tucked away in the basement of a youth hostel. There is one employee, Leila Borokhim, who takes your order, cooks your food, clears your table, and jokes around with you in between. People looking for a quick lunch should maybe go someplace else. People who lack a sense of humor, and patience, should go someplace else. But the food, oh, the food. This is truly some of the most delicious Persian food I have ever eaten. And the baklava, one of the few sweets I don&#8217;t usually care about, is revelatory. I&#8217;m obsessed.</p>
<p><a href="http://salvatorestomatopies.com/"><strong>Salvatore&#8217;s Tomato Pies</strong> </a></p>
<p>One of my favorite pizzas anywhere, ever. Seriously. The original is in an unassuming strip mall in Sun Prairie, about a 20 minute drive from Madison (and worth every mile), though they now also have a location down the street from Forequarter on Johnson. East coast style pizza, but with sauce on top. I recommend getting one with calabrian chile peppers. Their standard garden salad is like a farmers market come to life: edible flowers, sugar snap peas, multiple varieties of radishes, beets, carrots, onions, cherry tomatoes. It&#8217;s insane. I highly recommend ordering enough pizza so you can take some home. You&#8217;ll be so sad otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.madisonsourdough.com/"><strong>Madison Sourdough Co/Patisserie</strong></a></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t be a good city without good bread. Madison Sourdough provides it for Madison, along with delicious baked goods and lunches. A few months ago they opened a french patisserie next door and it is perfect. Classic French pastries that are extremely well executed. Their sable Breton is especially memorable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tornadosteakhouse.com/"><strong>Tornado Steakhouse</strong></a></p>
<p>Old school Madison steakhouse that is COOL. It&#8217;s expensive for dinner, and there are better options, so go after 10pm for their late-night menu and drinks. Sit in a curved booth and order some cheese curds and a couple of beers and you&#8217;re ready for a fun night.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15507" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/short-520x390.jpg" alt="short" width="520" height="390" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gibs.bar/"><strong>Gibs</strong></a></p>
<p>Craft Cocktails on Willy Street. Solid cocktails in slick new space (inside an old house). They have a few snacks on the menu, but really you&#8217;re coming here for a nice cocktail before or after dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sujeomadison.com/"><strong>Sujeo</strong> </a></p>
<p>Impressive pan-Asian food from one of Madison&#8217;s most famous chefs, Tory Miller (see L&#8217;Etoile/Graze). What the newly constructed space lacks in character, is more than made up for with the food.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thetiptoptavern.com/"><strong>Tip Top Tavern</strong> </a></p>
<p>Nothing fancy, but a really solid neighborhood spot in a former dive bar. The space has been beautifully renovated and the food is good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nattspil.com/"><strong>Natt Spil </strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t love the food or drinks here, but I love the atmosphere so much that I am including it. It is cozy, and the perfect place to drink a beer on a snowy night. Get a beer and the Middle-eastern plate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.osteriapapavero.com/"><strong>Osteria Papavero</strong></a></p>
<p>Locally sourced Italian food. Great charcuterie program. The Nduja pasta is wonderful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.union.wisc.edu/"><strong>Memorial Union Terrace </strong></a></p>
<p>During the summer, it can feel like the entire population of Madison is here drinking beer and listening to music. It is the place to hang out in Madison during warm weather. I could (and have) spent hours here enjoying the glory of a Midwestern summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bradburyscoffee.com/"><strong>Bradbury&#8217;s</strong></a></p>
<p>Coffee shop that sells crepes right off of the square. Really lovely place to start the day or get a snack.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.willystreet.coop/"><strong>Willy Street Co-op</strong> </a></p>
<p>Great coop, though its recent remodel has left if feeling a little less like the hippie den it once was. I love visiting grocery stores on vacation and this location is a major part of the Willy (Williamson) Street community.</p>
<p><a href="http://fromagination.com/"><strong>Fromagination</strong></a></p>
<p>Fantastic cheese shop with a stupid name. Spend some time here talking with the cheesemongers (many of whom are studying cheese-making at the university) and sampling Wisconsin&#8217;s finest cheeses. I love anything Willi Lerner (Bleu Mont Farm) produces, and his bandaged cheddar is an all-time favorite. Wisconsin cheeses are the best. Truly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greenbushbakery.com/"><strong>Greenbush Bakery</strong></a></p>
<p>Madison&#8217;s favorite donuts. They&#8217;re good, like donuts are.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15495" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_3795-520x520.jpg" alt="IMG_3795" width="520" height="520" srcset="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_3795-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_3795.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.letoile-restaurant.com/">L&#8217;Etolie</a>/<a href="http://www.grazemadison.com/">Graze</a></strong></p>
<p>L&#8217;Etoile is the OG fancy Madison foodie destination. It&#8217;s great, and chef Tory Miller is a genius with local produce. My only real complaint is that it feels a little stuffy and it is expensive. Still, worth doing at least once. Graze is it&#8217;s casual cousin next door, and has my favorite cheese curds in town.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chocolateshoppeicecream.com/"><strong>Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream</strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised by just how good this ice cream is, it has a real pure dairy flavor (which I guess shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise in Wisconsin?). I am a fan of the blueberry cheesecake, which has pieces of cheesecake folded into the ice cream. Don&#8217;t blame me when you have a heart attack.</p>
<p><a href="http://johnsonpublichouse.com/"><strong>Johnson Street Public House</strong></a></p>
<p>Great coffee and quintessential coffee shop vibes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15492" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0150-520x693.jpg" alt="Processed with VSCOcam with c1 preset" width="520" height="693" /></p>
<p><a href="http://dcfm.org/"><strong>Dane County Farmers Market</strong></a></p>
<p>The best farmers market in the country, and I will argue with you if you tell me otherwise. The variety and quantity of things available is spectacular. But most importantly, it is affordable. Every time I shop here I am reminded of how silliness and inaccessibility of Green City Market in Chicago. The market surrounds the capitol building and as you will quickly discover, everyone walks counterclockwise around the square. I recommend making two full loops, one to scout out your options, and the other to make purchases. Look out for hickory nuts, a rare treat. No visit to the market is complete without a stop at Stella&#8217;s Bakery for their famous hot and spicy cheese bread.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15498" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_8248-520x596.jpg" alt="Processed with VSCOcam with g3 preset" width="520" height="596" /></p>
<p><strong>SHOPS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.burniesrockshop.com/"><strong>Burnie&#8217;s Rock Shop</strong></a>&#8211; Quirky rock shop, great fun.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.contextclothing.com/"><strong>Context Clothing</strong></a>&#8211; Men&#8217;s clothing store that carries labels you expect to find in bigger cities and will be impressed to find in Madison. A bunch of friendly guys work here. Prices are high, but the quality is good.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kitchengallerymadison.com/"><strong>The Kitchen Gallery</strong></a>&#8211; Fantastic kitchen store. They have everything as well as a good selection of cookbooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roomofonesown.com/"><strong>A Room of One&#8217;s Own</strong></a>&#8211; Feminist/progressive book store. Pretty good cookbook selection.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15506" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rocks-520x646.jpg" alt="Processed with VSCOcam with a7 preset" width="520" height="646" /></p>
<p><strong>THINGS TO DO:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.geologymuseum.org/"><strong>Geology Museum</strong></a></p>
<p>This museum could be in a museum and I love it for that. Bryan says it combines his love of natural history and my love of pretty sparkly things. True.</p>
<p><a href="http://lakeshorepreserve.wisc.edu/visit/picnicpoint.htm"><strong>Picnic Point</strong></a></p>
<p>Nice place for a walk on the university campus. Great views of the capitol.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.olbrich.org/"><strong>Olbrich Botanical Gardens</strong></a></p>
<p>Impressive gardens, and a nice place to spend an afternoon. You could bring a picnic from Underground Butcher and sit at the lakefront.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chazen.wisc.edu/"><strong>Chazen Art Museum</strong></a></p>
<p>Decent collection, and some good special exhibitions. Great views of the lake from the second floor galleries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mmoca.org/"><strong>Madison Museum of Contemporary Art</strong></a></p>
<p>Small contemporary art space that hosts traveling shows and exhibits by local artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://arboretum.wisc.edu/"><strong>UW Arboretum</strong></a></p>
<p>A great place for a hike.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15512" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cap-520x513.jpg" alt="cap" width="520" height="513" /></p>
<p><strong>DETAILS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Madison is about a 2.5 hour drive (sometimes less) northwest of Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>Where to stay:</strong> I&#8217;m not sure it matters. We&#8217;ve stayed at many different hotels and they were all fine. We splurged on a recent trip and stayed at the newly renovated Edgewater Hotel, and it was a disappointment. It is sort of fake-fancy and the design felt soulless/corporate, which you can find elsewhere for half the price. I&#8217;d rather save the money to spend on cheese and beer. <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/hampton-inn-and-suites-madison-downtown-MSNBJHX/index.html">The Hampton Inn</a> is a solid, reasonably-priced choice. The <a href="http://madisondowntown.place.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html">Hyatt Place</a> is also a good choice. Generally speaking, I like staying near capitol square because it makes it easy to walk to many things you&#8217;ll want to do, and to stumble home drunk on cheese curds and beer. Bottom line: You don&#8217;t really go to Madison for the hotels, so just get a good deal at someplace comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Timing:</strong> Because the farmers market is Saturday morning, I think it is best to arrive in Madison on a Thursday or Friday and head back to Chicago with a car full of fresh food on Saturday. Because of all of the delicious food to eat, I think a two night stay is ideal, though one night will do in a pinch. If you&#8217;re visiting in the autumn, I would check the football schedule to see if there is a home game. It makes a difference. You may or may not like the difference.</p>
<p><strong>When to go:</strong> I&#8217;ve been to Madison in every season and I think they&#8217;re all great. October is probably my favorite month to visit, but summer is wonderful and less busy because school and the legislature are out of session. I&#8217;ve also gone mid-winter and had fun, though it can get cold.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15508" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/beer-520x390.jpg" alt="beer" width="520" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong>Random Tips:</strong></p>
<p>Wisconsin cocktails are sweet. Too sweet for me, even at nice restaurants. The only exceptions I have found are at Forequarter and Gibs. But mostly, stick with beer. Even at the lamest tourist restaurant you will be able to get a delicious pint of locally brewed beer, and it will be cheap. Delicious cheap beer is a core Wisconsin value. #bless</p>
<p>Eat fried cheese curds. As many as you can, as often as you can.</p>
<p>Stop at a <a href="http://www.woodmans-food.com/">Woodman&#8217;s</a> to see what seems like the largest grocery store in the world, that happens to be employee owned. They sell <a href="http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/">New Glarus beer</a>, the coveted only-in-Wisconsin brew that Illinoisans bring back to friends.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15517" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sun-520x626.jpg" alt="sun" width="520" height="626" srcset="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sun-520x626.jpg 520w, http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sun.jpg 605w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p><strong> Finally:</strong> Wisconsin is a pretty conservative state, though you wouldn&#8217;t know it in Madison. In 2011 Governor Scott Walker (a legit monster) and the Republican legislature&#8217;s anti-union agenda prompted some serious, and impressive, resistance by people in Madison, and throughout the state. Ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Wisconsin_protests">Wisconsin Uprising</a> (as it has been called), a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SolidaritySingAlong?fref=ts">Solidarity Sing Along</a> has taken place in or around the capitol building. It takes place every day at noon and anyone can join. Protest songs are sung, and camaraderie is fostered. It&#8217;s a really beautiful thing that makes me happy to be a human and so proud of everyone who participates.</p>
<p>Grill some brats, tap a keg<br />
And pass the cheddar<br />
We’ll be here ‘til Wisconsin gets better</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15500" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/protest-520x390.jpg" alt="protest" width="520" height="390" /></p>

<p>The last few weeks have been kind of juicy in the ole&#8217; U.S. of A.. I&#8217;ve felt everything from shame and anger to pride and joy as an American. That is my usual range of emotions related to my citizenship, I guess it has just felt very concentrated. That coupled with summer, and a series of fun visitors, has kept me pretty distracted. When we&#8217;ve been home, we&#8217;ve eaten a lot of old favorites. I&#8217;ve made <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2012/07/smoky-eggplant-puree-with-pine-nuts-urfa-pepper/" target="_blank">this</a> eggplant spread a couple of times and still love it. I baked <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2010/07/once-a-year/" target="_blank">these</a> cakes for the 4th of July and they were as good as ever.</p>
<div>I also tried another banana bread recipe. This one from the pages of Bon Appetit. I don&#8217;t actually read Bon Appetit anymore, I just use it for recipes—some sort of reverse Playboy thing is happening?  I do find myself wondering why magazines are making such a mess of themselves. The way to compete with the internet is not to make your magazine seem more like the internet—yet we&#8217;re being given lists and infographics and stupid celebrity stuff. But like I said, there are still some good recipes. This banana bread is from El Rey Coffee Bar &amp; Luncheonette in New York City and is a really special riff on everyone&#8217;s favorite quick bread that adds some sesame seeds and sesame paste to the mix.</div>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15366" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_4892-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_4892" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>The recipe <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/el-reys-sesame-banana-bread" target="_blank">as written</a> in Bon Appetit includes 2 1/4 cups of &#8220;lightly packed&#8221; dark brown sugar. I <em>literally</em> have no idea what it means to &#8220;lightly pack&#8221; brown sugar. Could a recipe instruction be more imprecise and point out every flaw in baking by volume? <em>No</em>. I found a weight-measured version of the recipe on, of all places, the Opening Ceremony <a href="http://www.openingceremony.us/entry.asp?pid=10638" target="_blank">blog</a> and used that instead. I packed the weighed brown sugar and it was about a cup and a half of firmly packed brown sugar, which seems like a more reliable way to go. I might play with sugar next time to see if I can reduce the amount, since the bananas are already sweet. If you try, let me know what happens. I baked the bread in a half pullman pan, but a standard 9&#215;5 loaf pan should do (that is the larger of the standard sized loaf pans). I used the rest of the Bon Appetit version, with the exception of the sugar measure. It&#8217;s really great.</p>

<p>Amanda Rockman has left the building.</p>
<p>After a good run in Chicago, she has packed her bags and headed back home to Texas. You may remember Amanda from the famous <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2014/04/lottie-doof-amanda-rockman/" target="_blank">Gateau Basque</a> recipe she shared on these pages. If you&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of eating a plate of sweets made by this super-talented chef, you probably won&#8217;t forget her. If pastry chefs were spirit animals, she&#8217;d probably be mine. So, as you might have guessed, I was a little bummed when I heard she was leaving town. So bummed that in her last couple of weeks I&#8217;d just show up at Nico and eat all of the desserts for dinner. Amanda&#8217;s been an important part of Chicago&#8217;s pastry scene for years—but Chicago&#8217;s loss is Austin&#8217;s gain (Austinites—Amanda will be in charge of all pastry at the soon to open <a href="http://southcongresshotel.com/" target="_blank">South Congress Hotel</a>, go tell her I said hello), and I am happy for Amanda and excited to see what she does next.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15430" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5099-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5099" width="520" height="347" /><span id="more-15421"></span></p>
<p>Before she left, Amanda kindly gifted us with one last recipe from her time in Chicago. This Butterscotch Bonet was on the last menu she designed for <a href="http://www.nicoosteria.com/" target="_blank">Nico Osteria</a>. It is phenomenally good, like, <em>Basque Cake Good</em>. A bonet is an Italian pudding thickened with egg yolks, and no starch. It&#8217;s basically the best butterscotch pudding you&#8217;ll ever have. While there are a bunch of components to this recipe, none are particularly difficult and you can make them all in advance. You could also choose to simplify things if you like and serve the pudding with some unsweetened whipped cream and sea salt flakes. But I don&#8217;t go through the trouble of finding you recipes like this to have you take the easy way out—<em>DO I?</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15429" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5092-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5092" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><em>Get thee a scale.</em></p>
<p><strong>Butterscotch Bonet by Amanda Rockman</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups + 2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
<li>2 1/4 ounces unsalted butter</li>
<li>246 grams dark brown sugar</li>
<li>3g salt</li>
<li>16g vanilla paste</li>
<li>12g amaro</li>
<li>135g egg yolks</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 350° F.</p>
<p>Heat the heavy cream to a simmer, and keep warm.</p>
<p>In a medium pot over medium-high heat, combine the butter and dark brown sugar and cook until sugar is melted and mixture is smooth. Reduce the heat to low and slowly add the hot cream to the sugar mixture, whisking as you pour the cream into the pot. Be careful! It will hiss and bubble and freak out. Once all of the cream is added whisk until all of the sugar is dissolved (some of the sugar may seize up when you add the hot cream and stick to the bottom edges of pan) and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat.</p>
<p>In a large heat-safe bowl, whisk the egg yolks to break them up. Starting with one ladleful of the hot butterscotch sauce, slowly whisk it into the egg yolks to temper them. Continue adding the butterscotch, a ladleful at a time, whisking constantly so that the eggs do not cook. Add the vanilla paste, salt, and amaro to the mixture and whisk to combine. Strain into a pitcher or a 4-cup pyrex measuring cup, to make it easier to pour.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;re going to have to do some figuring out here. You want a few oven-safe vessels to cook this in. They can be coffee or tea cups, ramekins, custard cups—whatever you have on hand. Ideally, they will all be the same size. The size of the cups, and how much you fill them will determine much of the rest of the recipe. I ended up filling 6 ramekins halfway full. Keep in mind that this is rich, and there are other components to the finished dessert. You&#8217;re going to set up a water bath for them to cook in using a large saucepan or a roasting pan. I like to line the bottom with a dish towel (it helps to prevent them from sliding around), and then set the filled ramekins on the dish towel. Slowly pour hot water into the roasting pan so that it goes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Also, if you used a kitchen towel, make sure it is submerged in water. Cover the whole thing with aluminum foil and carefully transfer to the preheated oven. Cook until the puddings are set, but the centers still have some jiggle to them. I would start checking at 25 minutes. Mine took about 35 minutes to cook. Once they are set, remove the pan from the oven, remove the aluminum foil, and allow them to cool in the water bath. Once cool, cover the puddings with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least an hour, or up to a couple of days.</p>
<p>When ready to serve, top each pudding with a small drizzle of <a href="https://ilovedatelady.com/project/organic-date-balsamic-vinegar/" target="_blank">date vinegar</a>, some sbrisolona (see recipe below), a spoonful of unsweetened whipped cream (or a combo of cream and creme fraiche), some flaked salt and some caramelized dates (to caramelize dates I removed the pits from dates, rubbed them with coconut oil and broiled for a couple of minutes).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15428" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5080-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_5080" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Sbrisolona (adapted slightly by Amanda Rockman from Brooks Headley)</p>
<ul>
<li>233 grams all-purpose flour<br />
233 grams instant polenta<br />
150 grams sugar</li>
<li>8 grams salt<br />
8 grams baking powder<br />
1 Egg<br />
½ Vanilla bean, scraped<br />
Zest from ½ lemon<br />
Zest from ½ orange<br />
233 grams unsalted butter, very cold</li>
<li>15 grams toasted white sesame seeds</li>
<li>75 grams raw cashews, finely chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a Silpat and set aside.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, polenta, sugar, salt, baking powder, egg, vanilla beans scrapings, lemon zest, and orange zest and mix by hand.</p>
<p>In a food processor, combine the butter and polenta mixture and pulse until the butter is pea size. Do not overpulse because you want there to be chunks of butter. (You can also do this part by hand, using a pastry cutter) Toss in the sesame seeds and cashews.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the mixture out into an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, stir with a fork, and finish baking until lightly browned, about 12-20 minutes more.</p>
<p>Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. The recipe makes a lot, but it is so delicious you&#8217;ll find yourself eating it on everything. On yogurt, as a healthy alternative to granola, for instance.</p>

<p>Who can resist the pretty little radishes that are being sold in Midwestern markets right now? They are great served with some salted butter, but they are even better when you coat them in butter and salt.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15434" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5122-520x765.jpg" alt="IMG_5122" width="520" height="765" /><span id="more-15441"></span></p>
<p>You need some small (bite-sized) radishes that you have cleaned well, dried thoroughly, and chilled in the refrigerator. You can leave some greens, if you like. You also need a stick of butter and some flaked sea salt.</p>
<p>Your goal is to get your butter to the consistency of a thin mayonnaise without is separating. There are several ways to do this, but I think it is easiest in the microwave. I put a stick of butter in a bowl and microwave it on high for 25 seconds. At which point it will be a little less than halfway melted. I then whisk the butter vigorously and see what the consistency is like. If it is still thick, I will microwave it for another 3-5 seconds at a time until it is a consistency that will work—something like a loose mayo, or melted white chocolate. (Full disclosure: The photo above is not my best work. The butter could have been a little thinner and the finished product would be more elegant. What can I say?—I was rushing.) You&#8217;re going to have to experiment a bit as all microwaves work differently. If you go too far and the butter all melts, just let it firm up and try again. Additionally, there is a more complicated technique for tempering butter <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/ingredients/article/you-can-judge-a-radish-by-its-cover" target="_blank">here </a>that you can try if you do not have a microwave.</p>
<p>Once your butter is the right consistency, dip half of each radish in the butter and sprinkle with salt (smoked salt is nice, too). Transfer radishes to a parchment-lined sheet pan and place in the refrigerator so the butter has a chance to firm up.</p>

<p><strong>Chile-Cumin Lamb Meatballs with Yogurt and Cucumber</strong> (recipe adapted (to simplify) from Seamus Mullen via <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chile-cumin-lamb-meatballs-with-yogurt-and-cucumber" target="_blank">Bon Appetit</a>)</p>
<p>Chile Sauce</p>
<ul>
<li>3 pasilla chiles, seeds removed, chopped</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>¼ cup Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sweet smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, chopped</li>
<li>½ cup olive oil</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Meatballs and Assembly</p>
<ul>
<li>¼ small onion, chopped</li>
<li>8 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (plus extra for garnish)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano (or 1/2 teaspoon dry)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1¼ pounds ground lamb</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rice flour or all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2–3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>For serving</p>
<ul>
<li>½ English hothouse cucumber, thinly sliced and tossed with some lemon juice, olive oil, and salt</li>
<li>½ cup plain sheep’s-milk or cow’s whole-milk yogurt (I like to add some salt and a minced clove of garlic to the yogurt)</li>
<li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
</ul>
<p>Chile Sauce</p>
<p>Toast chiles, red pepper flakes, and cumin seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant and cumin seeds are golden, about 3 minutes. Let cool. Working in batches, finely grind in a spice mill, then transfer to a blender.</p>
<p>Add vinegar, paprika, and garlic to blender and blend until smooth. With the motor running, gradually stream in oil and blend until combined. Transfer to a large bowl and season with salt.</p>
<p>Chile sauce can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.</p>
<p>Meatballs and Assembly</p>
<p>Pulse onion, chopped garlic, parsley, oregano, sage, fennel seeds, coriander, cumin, and 1 tablespoon salt in a food processor, scraping down sides as needed, until finely chopped. Add egg, lamb, and flour and pulse until evenly combined. Form lamb mixture into 1 ½&#8221; balls.</p>
<p>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in 2 batches and adding another 1 Tbsp. oil to skillet if needed, cook meatballs, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through, 5–8 minutes. Transfer meatballs to paper towels to drain.</p>
<p>Transfer all meatballs to bowl with chile sauce and toss to coat.</p>
<p>Spoon yogurt into bowls. Evenly divide meatballs among bowls; top with dressed cucumber and parsley and  sprinkle with red pepper flakes.</p>
<p>This becomes a meal if you serve it with some pita, and maybe a bowl of hummus.</p>

<p><a href="http://theglutenlie.com/" target="_blank">Alan Levinovitz</a> is a professor of philosophy and religious studies and so it may be surprising that his latest book is about American diets. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Gluten-Lie-Other-Myths/dp/1941393063" target="_blank"><em>The Gluten Lie: And Other Myths About What You Eat</em></a> (deliberately provocative title, <em>jeez</em>!), he explores the myths and pseudoscience that much of our culture&#8217;s dietary understanding is based upon. He makes smart observations about the ways we use religious ideas and arguments to talk about food. And argues for a relationship with food that is less anxiety-ridden and fearful.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once, at a farmers&#8217; market, I asked a juice vendor whether her juice counted as &#8220;processed&#8221;—yet another vague, unscientific epithet that gets thrown around in discussions of food. After a moment of shock, she impressed upon me that processing fruit into juice doesn&#8217;t result in processed food. Only corporations, she insisted, were capable of making processed food. Not only that, but it wasn&#8217;t the processing that made something processed, so much as the presence of chemicals and additives.</p>
<p>Did the optional protein powder she offered count as a chemical additive, I pressed? A tan, gaunt customer interrupted us.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy,&#8221; she said, staring at me intensely. &#8220;Processed food is evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Processed food is evil. Natural food is good. These are religious mantras, the condensed version of simplistic fairy tales that divide up foods, and the world, according to moralistic binaries. Genuine nutritional science, like all science, rejects oversimplification. &#8220;Natural&#8221; and &#8220;processed&#8221; are not scientific categories, and neither is good nor evil. These terms should be employed by monks and gurus, not doctors and scientists. Yet it is precisely such categories, largely unquestioned, that determine most people&#8217;s supposedly scientific decisions about what and how to eat.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-15390"></span></p>
<p>I first came across Levinovitz through <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/05/the-puritanical-approach-to-food/392030/" target="_blank">an article</a> in The Atlantic. It was one of the most interesting things I&#8217;ve read in a while, and it made me want to read the whole argument. The book is great. Levinovitz really enjoys arguing, and it is always fun to read that kind of writing—he&#8217;s also very good at it. He cleverly traces past dietary &#8220;demons&#8221; like MSG and connects their rise and fall to the parts of our diet that have come under attack in recent years (specifically gluten, sugar, fat and salt). He does this as only a philosophy professor can, by challenging our ways of thinking and knowing. By presenting the overwhelming <em>lack</em> of evidence for any specific dietary recommendations. He challenges the media&#8217;s mostly irresponsible reporting on wildly conflicting studies that leave the general population distrustful of science. He also makes some pretty progressive recommendations for how to start changing our relationship with food—spoiler alert: e<em>ating in the fourth dimension!</em></p>
<p>The book has really changed the way I think about food and nutritional science. It has highlighted some of the ways in which I have been lazy in my own thinking.  The self-congratulatory feeling I get when drinking a glass of red wine is probably not warranted.</p>
<p>I hope some of you have read the book and will want to discuss it in the comments. I would love to hear what you think. I am especially interested in how these trends are reflected in food media. I see this sort of pseudoscience creeping into more and more cookbooks and magazines.</p>
<p>So little evidence, so many myths&#8230;</p>

<p>Farmers Markets are slowly reopening in Chicago. I like this time of year, the produce tastes good, and it&#8217;s fun to be outdoors. But I often buy stuff just for the novelty of buying stuff, which is stupid. Sometimes, though, it pays off—like with the bunch of lovage that I impulse-bought at Green City Market on Saturday. I don&#8217;t see lovage very often, and I got excited. For those of you unfamiliar, lovage is herbaceous plant that tastes somewhat like celery—though more intense, and perhaps also a bit like lime. It&#8217;s delicious. <span id="more-15375"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15378" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_4972-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_4972" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>I improvised a syrup using the lovage I bought. After making the syrup, I remembered that I had come across a cocktail recipe using lovage at some point. I found it in the Franny&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frannys-Seasonal-Italian-Andrew-Feinberg/dp/1579654649" target="_blank">cookbook</a>. It was for a &#8220;celery&#8221; soda. It couldn&#8217;t be simpler, you combine some of the lovage syrup with a bit of lime juice and a couple of dashes of celery bitters (which we happened to have, though they are not strictly necessary). Add sparkling water and you have one of the freshest, most delicious soft drinks I&#8217;ve ever had—though a little gin wouldn&#8217;t hurt. It was so good that it got me thinking about a drink of summer—<a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2010/06/drink-of-summer-2010-the-nominees-vote/" target="_blank"><em>the</em></a> drink of summer. This lovage syrup seems like a good starting point.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15381" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_49881-520x347.jpg" alt="IMG_4988" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Fun fact: The stalks of lovage are hollow and can be used as straws. <em>How Pinterest-able is that?</em></p>

<p><strong>Lovage Syrup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>1 cup (packed) lovage leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the sugar and water in a pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until sugar has dissolved. Add the lovage leaves and stir to combine. Remove from heat, cover, and let steep for 2-3 hours. Strain syrup into a glass jar (pressing on leaves to extract all of the syrup) and store in the refrigerator. The syrup will keep well for at least a couple of months.</p>

<p>I met Dana Cree this past autumn when I moderated a <a href="http://taste-talks.com/" target="_blank">Taste Talks</a> panel on one of my favorite topics, ice cream. Dana is one of Chicago&#8217;s most celebrated and beloved pastry chefs and is responsible for the sweets at both <a href="http://blackbirdrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Blackbird</a> and <a href="http://avecrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Avec</a>, two of Chicago&#8217;s most celebrated and beloved restaurants. She has twice been nominated for a James Beard award for her work at Blackbird. Dana really loves making (and eating) ice cream. She&#8217;s been selling small batches of her carefully produced pints at Chicago&#8217;s <a href="http://publicanqualitymeats.com/" target="_blank">Publican Quality Meats,</a> where each one warmly introduces itself with a &#8220;Hello my name is&#8230;&#8221; tag. Someday she&#8217;ll undoubtedly have her own ice cream shop (I can&#8217;t wait!), but for now we hoard pints. Her ice cream landed her on that panel with me where I learned that Dana is funny (she talked about poop!), smart (further evidence available on her beautiful <a href="http://thepastrydepartment.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>) and generous (here she is!).<span id="more-15312"></span></p>
<p>There is one recipe that Dana is most famous for. It is these little peanut butter confections that have, up until now, shared a name with a certain commercially produced cookie. You know the one, its name rhymes with Mutter Putter. They have followed her across the country and become cult favorites everywhere she works. They&#8217;re currently on the menu at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dana+cree+nutterbutters&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-x5KVdiCE4nYsAXv5oC4BA&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAw&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949#tbm=isch&amp;q=avec+nutterbutters" target="_blank">Avec</a>, and they are spectacular. All of the sweet/salty pleasure you crave, crammed into a 1-inch by 1-inch square. Sometimes, they even get chopped up and folded into a pint of her vanilla bean ice cream. And now, thanks to the funny, smart and generous Dana Cree, they are yours to make at home.</p>
<p>But first! Back to that trademark protected name. Dana wants our help renaming these beauties. She plans on continuing to include them in her repertoire, and fold them into ice cream and she wants to have her own unique name for them (and avoid a cease and desist order). What should they be called?! How do we capture their magnificence in words? Let&#8217;s brainstorm in the comments below. <em>Help us, Lottie + Doofers, you&#8217;re our only hope</em>.</p>
<p>But second! Dana answered some pressing questions:</p>

<p>I was in culinary school and it was the first transcendental food experience for me, in a minimalist Northern Italian-inspired restaurant in Seattle that is now shut. I immediately set to the task of getting myself a job there. It took several tries but I worked there for 3 years and it defined the path I set on for cooking after that.</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s the story with this recipe?</b></p>
<p>I worked at a restaurant called Veil in Seattle, and the inspiration for the nutter butter was a feuilletine crumble with peanut butter and cocoa nibs, that sat under a peanut butter ice cream. When I was at Poppy and we started preparing a dessert Thali, a round tray that included a plated dessert, an ice cream coupe, and 4 little duets of sweet bites. I needed to come up with little confections and bites that were unique, and I re-appropriated the peanut butter crumble and altered it so I could press it into the base of a sheet pan, then I covered it with a white chocolate caramel, cut it in squares, and the rest is history! Since then I have introduced them to the menu at Avec, and we chop them up and add them to vanilla ice cream for our Nutterbutter ice cream in pints at PQM.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15334" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_4828-520x494.jpg" alt="IMG_4828" width="520" height="494" /></p>
<p>Notes about this recipe: Perhaps no recipe has ever has a better ratio of work expended/deliciousness gained. This is a pretty simple recipe, though it may look scary at first. It uses a couple of pastry chef ingredients, feuilletine and cocoa butter, that will require seeking out. Feuilletine is something that more people should know about, it is versatile and delicious and a secret pastry chef weapon. You can find them both <a href="http://chefshop.com/Feuilletine-Flakes-Pastry-Crunch-P7969.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. There is one spot where I had a tiny amount of trouble with the recipe. See the very subtle variations in color in the caramel glaze in the above photo? It should be more uniform in color. My glaze separated a tiny, tiny, bit in the batch of these I made to photograph (of course!). This can happen if there isn&#8217;t enough liquid in the glaze (probably a result of too much evaporation when you scald the cream). If, when you are whisking the caramel and white chocolate together it doesn&#8217;t seem like they are fully combining, try adding a teaspoon of hot water and it should do the trick. But also know, that this small imperfection did not effect the flavor at all. Just, you know, heads up.</p>
<p>Seriously, these are one of the best things you will ever make.</p>

<li>450g peanut butter (preferred: Skippy, creamy)</li>
<li>150g milk chocolate</li>
<li>65g cocoa butter</li>
<li>100g cocoa nibs</li>
<li>300g feuilletine</li>
<li>5g kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Spray a very flat quarter sheet pan with pan spray and line with parchment. Set aside.</p>
<p>2. Place peanut butter, milk chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa nibs, and salt in a large metal bowl. Place over a double boiler to melt, stirring occasionally.</p>
<p>3. When completely fluid, add the feuilletine and fold to completely incorporate.</p>
<p>4. Transfer to the lined sheetpan, and spread the mixture evenly into the pan. Using the offset spatula, lightly massage the mixture until the feuilletine is flat and the fluid chocolate and peanut butter is visible on the top.</p>
<p>5. Chill until completely firm and prepare the topping.</p>
<p>Caramel Ganache</p>
<ul>
<li>100g sugar</li>
<li>150g cream</li>
<li>1/2 vanilla bean</li>
<li>2.5g kosher salt</li>
<li>300g white chocolate</li>
<li>40g butter</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Scald cream with vanilla bean and set aside, keeping warm. Measure the white chocolate and salt into a bowl and set a strainer over the top. Set aside.</p>
<p>2. Caramelize the sugar until smoking and producing a froth on the top. It will look as if you are burning the sugar, and you are. this is necessary to bring any real caramel flavor through the white chocolate. Don&#8217;t be afraid, it will be delicious.</p>
<p>3. Remove the burnt caramel from the heat, and add the butter. Allow the butter to melt, and sizzle on the top of the caramel before stirring in, allowing the butter solids to brown. Once the butter has started to brown, stir the butter into the caramel, and add the warm vanilla cream, stirring until completely incorporated.</p>
<p>4. Strain the caramel directly over the white chocolate, and stir to incorporate.</p>
<p>5. Immediately spread the caramel over the nutter butter base and spread until even.</p>
<p>6. Chill overnight.</p>
<p>7. Cut into 1 inch squares for service.</p>
<p>They can be served cold from the fridge, which I kind of like best. Or at room temperature.</p>

<p>This, obviously, makes a quarter sheet pan of amazingness, which when cut into 1-inch squares is a LOT of squares—117 to be exact. Good news: they keep really well in the fridge. At least for a week, maybe two, maybe longer. Also, they can be chopped up and folded into some vanilla ice cream. Also, they will help you make friends, so share them. Throw a party, they are reason to celebrate.</p>
<p>BUT WHAT SHOULD THEY BE CALLED??????????</p>

<p>Maria Speck has written a second cookbook, <em>Simply Ancient Grains</em>, and it is reason to celebrate. I fell in love with Maria&#8217;s cooking and writing a couple of years ago when she published her first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Grains-Modern-Meals-Mediterranean/dp/1580083544" target="_blank"><em>Ancient Grains for Modern Meals</em></a>. It&#8217;s a book that has become a favorite in our house and taught me a lot about cooking with whole grains. I know I need more delicious grain recipes in my life, you probably do, too. <span id="more-15296"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sharing a recipe for a tomato sauce infused with the flavors of saffron, bay, and vermouth, that does not actually include any grains (?!). But it is so delicious and  it goes so well with grains (or anything, really) that you will find many uses for it. I&#8217;ve made two batches of this and will make it many more times, <em>forever</em>. It is lovely tossed with some whole grain capellini. If you&#8217;re going that route, I would also top the pasta with a few spoonfuls of fresh ricotta that has been seasoned with flake salt and red pepper flakes, and loosened a bit with some olive oil. It makes for a wonderful dinner. Maria also suggests mixing the sauce with some cooked quinoa, spreading it in a baking dish, topping it with slabs of feta and some slices of hot pepper and baking the whole thing. This is probably my favorite use, especially when scooped up with some crusty baguette. The sauce would also be delicious spooned over a slice of toast and topped with a fried egg. You get the idea, it is USEFUL. It is the sort of thing that you can make on Sunday night and be eating all week. Which we have done twice now, and it has made for a couple of very delicious weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Insider advanced warning</strong>: Maria, who is on a country-wide book tour, will be spending some time in Chicago—with me! And you! Floriole is hosting a reception and book signing on the evening of May 31st that will include a conversation between Maria and me. We&#8217;ll talk about all sorts of things, like writing cookbooks, cooking with ancient grains, and the internet. Floriole&#8217;s kitchen crew will be making food from the book. It&#8217;s going to be rad. Details will be updated here SOON. And tickets will be available on Floriole&#8217;s <a href="http://www.floriole.com/events/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of becoming friends with Maria and I can promise you that she is as charming in person as she is on the page. You&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><strong>Saffron-Infused Tomato Sauce with Vermouth</strong> (adapted slightly from Maria Speck&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simply-Ancient-Grains-Flavorful-Recipes/dp/1607745887" target="_blank"><em>Simply Ancient Grains</em></a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>6 shallots, thinly sliced crosswise (2 cups)</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon loosely packed saffron threads</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup dry vermouth</li>
<li>2 28-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices, crushed</li>
<li>1-2 teaspoons sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat a large dutch over over medium heat. Add the olive oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the shallots, garlic, bay leaves, saffron, and salt and cook, stirring often, until the shallots soften and turn golden (from the saffron), about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the vermouth and cook, stirring occasionally, until it becomes thick and is mostly evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juices, 1 teaspoon of the sugar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Decrease the heat to maintain a steady simmer, cover with the lid askew about an inch, and cook for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Uncover, stir, and continue cooking at a steady simmer , stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaves. Season with the remaining sugar, if desired. Also, taste and add additional salt if necessary.</p>

<p>There are a lot of cookbooks written by professional chefs who seem to have no memory of what it is like to cook at home. They often include complex recipes full of ingredients that are only available foraged from the forests of Northern California. Some of these books are perfectly lovely books and can be enjoyed for other reasons, but they&#8217;re unlikely to get much use in my kitchen. They&#8217;re aspirational, which I&#8217;m okay with—<em>sometimes</em>. More often, I want a book I can and will use regularly. On the other end of the spectrum there are books specifically designed for home cooks that include uninspired recipes for things like chocolate chip cookies or roasted chicken. Apparently, they&#8217;ve never heard about the internet. It is some seriously boring stuff. The current cookbook landscape leaves one feeling a bit like Goldilocks, looking for<i> just right</i>.</p>
<p>Mindy Segal, Chicago&#8217;s most iconic pastry chef, released her first cookbook, <i>Cookie Love, </i>this week<i>.</i> Segal is a James Beard award-winning (and frequently nominated) pastry chef who has been pushing sweets at <a href="http://hotchocolatechicago.com/" target="_blank">Hot Chocolate</a>, her restaurant/dessert bar, for the past decade. I learned to love pastry at Hot Chocolate. I lived near the restaurant for years and was a frequent and enthusiastic patron. The sweets she made were progressive and exciting, as well as totally satisfying and familiar. She never served a dessert so weird that you could not relax and enjoy it; her focus was on pleasure. She used salt and acid and temperature in her desserts, the way a savory cook might (and the way all pastry cooks should!). It lead to some incredible stuff. I have often hoped she would write a book—I was desperate for her secrets. About a year ago I learned that a book was finally happening, and that it would focus on cookies, the uncontested highest form of dessert. A food writer I admire, <a href="http://modernmealmaker.com/" target="_blank">Kate Leahy</a>, signed on to write the book with Segal. She has past experience translating the work of chefs to the home kitchen. Their book, published by <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/237313/cookie-love-by-mindy-segal-and-kate-leahy" target="_blank">Ten Speed Press</a>, turns out to be exactly what this Goldilocks has been looking for.<span id="more-15234"></span></p>
<p>The book is divided into chapters based on different cookie types (bar cookies, shortbread, etc)—kind of a choose your own cookie-plate adventure. The range and variety of cookies is truly impressive, and it is what stood out when I first flipped through the book. The recipes are universally appealing—they are cookies after all. These are the kind of recipes that get me hyped up to get in the kitchen and bake. I&#8217;ve spent the last couple of weeks baking from the book. I intended to test three recipes and somehow three became six. <em>I can&#8217;t stop</em>. Segal and Leahy have created a cookbook that manages to speak to home cooks and their experiences, while not treating them like idiots. They also have given us the tools to make really amazing cookies.</p>
<p>I started with Segal&#8217;s Snickerdoodle (or as she calls them: Any Which Way But You Will Never Lose Snickerdoodles). These primary school favorites are transformed using a simple seasoning technique Segal employs throughout the book: a combination of kosher salt and flake salt. It creates a well-salted cookie (kosher salt) with slightly irregular pops of saltiness (flake salt). It makes the eating of the cookie an adventure, and really elevates this sweet and cinnamony American standard. It is the sort of simple technique that is taught throughout the book, and the first of many indications that Segal (and Leahy) were thinking about home cooks. They&#8217;re not just giving us recipes, they are educating us along the way and providing us with techniques that will not only work in their recipes, but in any recipe we try.</p>
<p>I am a sucker for thumbprint cookies, and was immediately drawn to the Peanut Butter Thumbprints with Strawberry Lambic Jam. The jam is another great technique recipe in which fruit is first macerated, and then cooked down with a small amount of sugar and a healthy dose of a berry lambic. The whole thing takes about 30 minutes of stirring at the jam pot, and has changed the way I think about small-batch preserves. The jam stands alone, and is worth making and spreading on your morning toast. I&#8217;m going to be experimenting with this method all summer. In the cookie recipe, the jam fills the center of a peanut butter dough that has been rolled in crushed Beer Nuts. It&#8217;s a recipe that I find intellectually satisfying (beer jam + Beer Nuts), as well as delicious. The recipe instructions for this cookie are a good example of how thoughtfully and precisely written the recipes in the book are. They describe a technique for forming the thumbprints that is simple, but allows the home cook to have some of the uniformity and finesse of a pastry cook. In fact, all of the dough-handling techniques described in the book are clear and lead to beautiful finished products.</p>
<p>I also made Goat Butter Shortbread (which might be my favorite shortbread ever), a Raspberry and Rose Rugelach (as good as it sounds), and some Honey Walnut Bars (a salty/sweet fantastyland). They were all superb. They are better than any other cookie recipes I&#8217;ve found–modern, exciting, smart. I will make every recipe again. The recipes also all work exactly as directed, and the recipe instructions make you confident you are doing things correctly. I&#8217;ve baked a lot of cookies in my day, and to randomly pick a half dozen recipes from a book and have them all be winners, is something very special. It&#8217;s unprecedented in my experience with baking books.</p>
<p>The recipes are where the book really shines, and that&#8217;s as it should be. But I also enjoyed reading the headnotes to each recipe. They give you useful insight into Segal&#8217;s process or the origins of the recipe. The voice of the book is charming and friendly; you&#8217;re happy to spend time with the authors. They make a point of encouraging you to experiment and have fun with the recipes. Segal is not a dictator, she is a mentor. The final chapters of the book are especially successful. These chapters cover topics like pantry ingredients, kitchen tools, and &#8220;tricks of the trade&#8221; (a mini-master class in baking). These sections in cookbooks can be a real bore, but here they stand out and are full of information, insights, and techniques that you&#8217;ll use again and again.</p>
<p>There are a couple of unusual decisions that warrant mentioning. Extra-large eggs are used throughout the book, a deviation from what has become standard (large eggs) in recipe writing. So, you have to buy eggs specifically for this book. Kind of annoying, but not a big deal. Segal also suggests a technique for measuring flour that goes against everything that home cooks have been taught for at least the past decade. It has become the standard that when measuring flour, you spoon it into your measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge. It is a lesson taught in the vast majority of baking books published in this country and  I see it on televised cooking shows regularly. It is <i>How You Measure Flour</i>. Instead, Segal has you actually scoop the flour out with the measuring cup and then level it off. It means that your cup of flour using her method weighs significantly more than a cup of flour using the more common method. These two choices are notable for their deviation from the norm, but I was able to look past both once I started eating the cookies. I do worry it will get in the way of some home cooks who think egg size doesn&#8217;t matter (it does) and who do not read the fine print and are short on flour in every recipe. Their fault, I guess—the instructions are clear. Regardless, these are small details, and not things I would categorize as problems with the book.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15241" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4807-520x313.jpg" alt="IMG_4807" width="520" height="313" /></p>
<p>The one place where the book falls short, is in its design. Though it is technically well-executed, it all feels pretty generic. The book looks too much like the type of food blogs that have become ubiquitous in recent years—weathered wood, rusty old spoons, and an over-abundance of crumbs. I think this style started off as a nod toward the authentic—<i>cooking is messy and imperfect!</i> Which was an understandable response to the high-gloss fakery of the food styling that preceded it. But through its over-use it has come to signify the inauthentic, it simply looks like trends—and tired trends, at that. Remove the delicious-looking cookies from these photographs, and you are left with some weird abstract spaces, a bunch of crumbs that don&#8217;t belong there, and some creepy old ice cream scoops. Of course my own dislike of the aesthetic is subjective, and isn&#8217;t really the problem. The problem is that the design does not reflect or support the content of the book (other than in a documentary way). The text is so authentic, creative, and specific, but the design could have been for any cookbook about anything written by anyone, 2008-the present. Where is Segal in those images? Not literally, but how do the images reflect a real person, a real kitchen, real stories? The photography and styling are unintentionally at their most successful when Segal&#8217;s tattooed arm happens to appear in the frame. The specificity of her flesh makes you realize how desperate you are for something that feels like it belongs to the author, or to real life.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15240" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4804-520x307.jpg" alt="IMG_4804" width="520" height="307" /></p>
<p>But for all of the recent talk about the importance of cookbook design, it rarely ruins a great text or saves a terrible one. It certainly can&#8217;t stand in the way of the brilliance of this book. For me, <em>Cookie Love</em> is the proverbial <em>instant classic</em> that will help home bakers get one step closer to baking like a pastry chef thanks to the lessons these recipes teach us. By giving us something that manages to be both aspirational and attainable, Segal and Leahy got this one just right.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-15239" src="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4727-520x399.jpg" alt="IMG_4727" width="520" height="399" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m including the recipe for Blueberry Kolachkes with Orange Blossom Almonds, it wasn&#8217;t an easy choice. I divided my batch of cream cheese dough in half so I could try two cookies from the chapter on kolachkes and rugelach, I suggest you do the same. The only note I would add to these is that they really are best the day they are made. Because the filling in these uses a starch to thicken it, they have a higher moisture content than the rest of the jams used in Segal&#8217;s cookies. It means they get softer much faster. But oh, the glory of them on the day they are made! (Pro tip: if you have leftover blueberry filling, or almonds, they are both delicious on a bowl of yogurt!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BLUEBERRY JAM KOLACHKES WITH ORANGE BLOSSOM ALMONDS</strong> (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cookie-Love-Techniques-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/1607746816" target="_blank"><em>Cookie Love</em></a> by Mindy Segal with Kate Leahy)</p>
<p>FILLING<br />
4 cups (1 ¼ pounds) fresh or frozen blueberries<br />
⅓ cup granulated sugar<br />
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice<br />
1 teaspoon orange blossom water<br />
2 teaspoons tapioca starch</p>
<p>COOKIES<br />
1 recipe Classic Cream Cheese Dough, divided in half and chilled<br />
1 extra-large egg white, lightly beaten</p>
<p>ORANGE BLOSSOM ALMONDS<br />
3 cups untoasted sliced almonds<br />
½ cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted<br />
Pinch of sea salt flakes<br />
3 to 4 teaspoons orange blossom water</p>
<p>To make the filling:<br />
Combine the blueberries, sugar, orange juice, and orange blossom water in a bowl and let macerate for at least 4 hours at room temperature or cover and refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p>Set aside 2 tablespoons or so of the blueberry juice in a small bowl. In a high-sided, heavy pot, heat the fruit mixture over medium-high heat until the juices start to boil. Simmer briefly. Whisk the tapioca starch into the reserved blueberry juice. Stir it into the fruit mixture, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Transfer to a storage container and refrigerate until completely chilled, approximately 1 hour.</p>
<p>To make the cookies:</p>
<p>Put a sheet of parchment paper the same dimensions as a half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pan on the work surface and dust lightly with flour. Unwrap one dough half and place on top.</p>
<p>Using a rolling pin and a pastry roller, roll the dough half into a rectangle, leaving a 1-inch border from the edge of the parchment paper. If the edges become uneven, push a bench scraper against &#8212; he sides to straighten them out. To keep the dough from sticking to the parch-ment paper, periodically dust the top lightly with flour, cover with another piece of parchment paper, and, sand-wiching the dough between both sheets of parchment paper, flip the dough and paper over. Peel off the top layer of parchment paper and continue to roll. Repeat with the second dough half. Stack both sheets of dough on top of each other and refrigerate until chilled, approximately 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 350°F. Line a few half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly coat with nonstick cooking spray.</p>
<p>Invert the sheets of dough onto the work surface and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Using a 2-inch (or comparable) square cookie cutter, cut out the kolachkes. Reroll the scraps, chill for at least 20 minutes, and cut out more squares.<br />
Using an offset spatula, separate a square away from the rest of the dough. Put a generous spoonful of blueberry jam diagonally across the center of the square, from point to point, keeping the other corners free. Fold the empty<br />
corners over the top so they overlap and pinch them closed. Place on the prepared sheet pan and repeat with the remaining squares, spacing them on the pans 1 inch apart. Brush the tops with the egg white.</p>
<p>To make the Orange Blossom almonds:</p>
<p>In a bowl, mix together the almonds, confectioners’ sugar, and sea salt. Add just enough orange blossom water to ensure that all of the almonds are damp but not soaking. Generously pile the almonds on top of the kolachkes.<br />
Bake one pan at a time for 15 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake for another 7 to 10 minutes, or until the nuts are golden brown. If the nuts begin to brown too much before the rest of the kolachkes are baked, lower the oven temperature. Let the cookies cool on the sheet pan for 1 to 2 minutes. Using an offset spatula, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining pans.</p>
<p>Kolachkes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.</p>
<p>CLASSIC CREAM CHEESE DOUGH</p>
<p>1 cup (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />
8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br />
⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br />
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br />
1 teaspoon kosher salt<br />
1 teaspoon sea salt flakes</p>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter on medium speed for 5 to 10 seconds. Add the cream cheese and mix on medium speed to combine, 10 to 15 seconds. Add the sugar and beat on medium speed until aerated, approximately 3 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to bring the batter together.</p>
<p>On medium speed, add the vanilla, mixing briefly until incorporated. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to bring the batter together.</p>
<p>In a bowl, whisk together the flour and salts.</p>
<p>Add the flour mixture all at once and mix on low speed until the dough just comes together but still looks shaggy, approxi-mately 30 seconds. Do not overmix. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand.</p>
<p>Stretch two sheets of plastic wrap on a work surface. Divide the dough in half (each half will weigh around 14 ½ ounces) and place a half on each piece of plastic. Pat the dough into rectangles, wrap tightly, and refrigerate until chilled throughout, at least 2 hours or up to 1 week.</p>
