The<em> </em>exhibition (which runs from September 23, 2014 and January 4, 2015) assembles more than 400 objects for the first time, including photography, album artwork, hand-written song lyrics, original fashions, set designs, and rare performance material from the David Bowie Archive. It also features an interactive multimedia design that incorporates advanced sound technology, original animations, and video installations to create “an immersive journey through Bowie's artistic life,” according to the MCA press release.

The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, organized the exhibition, with the Chicago exhibition coordinated by Michael Darling and MCA Chief Curator James W. Alsdorf.

Volunteers came together with partner families to complete the initial construction of 13 homes. Immediately following the event, these new homes were taken into communities across the region, where they will be finished and become homes 13 families can call their own. Actor Jim Belushi lent a hand—and a hammer.

"Raise Your Hand Chicagoland" is a Habitat for Humanity event that invites everyone in Chicagoland to raise their hand and join Habitat to transform families and communities," said Chicagoland Habitat for Humanity CEO Matt Johnson. "With the help of over 400 dedicated volunteers and deserving partner families, we'll be constructing the exterior of one home and wall frames for 12 along one of Chicago's busiest corridors."

Within the past 12 months, Habitat has helped more than 200 families, and by 2018, Habitat for Humanity in Chicagoland hopes to serve at least 500 families every year.

Within the past 12 months, Habitat has helped more than 200 families, and by 2018, Habitat for Humanity in Chicagoland hopes to serve at least 500 families every year.

That is so that I can either steal the look or simply share with readers who may themselves be as interested in the superficial as I.

It seems like a rather simple transaction, right? I ask you what designer you're wearing and you tell me.

Well, you wouldn't believe the responses I get: everything from scoffs to eye rolls to an "I don't know."

Like the time Lisa Marie Presley claimed she didn't know her dress size when I saw her at <a href="http://www.citywinery.com/chicago/" target="_blank">City Winery Chicago</a>.

This event occurred not long  after the Oprah interview, where Presley appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzeTKgKI8TM" target="_blank">meatier than even the talk-show host</a>. Elvis' daughter had subsequently lost so much weight  she looked to be a child's size 14 or 16. Generally speaking, after an adolescent female grows past these juniors' sizes, she would then be on the cusp of wearing a women's 0, 2, 4, and so on.

And while I'm ranting about skinny bitches, can we talk about just how ridiculous <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomerService?textKey=HELP_SIZECHART&amp;catalogId=10901&amp;DM_PersistentCookieCreated=true&amp;langId=-1&amp;pageName=size-charts&amp;storeId=10051" target="_blank">Abercrombie</a> is with its so-called women sizes of extra-extra small, and extra-extra-extra small! And double-zero. What's <em>that</em> about...?

Being a skinny bitch myself, I thought Presley's weight loss looked too obvious. But maybe it's just my perception that she went from one day looking like the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/21/carnie-wilson-has-lap-band-weight-loss-surgery-again_n_1370723.html" target="_blank">old Carnie Wilson</a> to the <a href="http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/kate-moss-the-waif-that-roared-2367932" target="_blank">old Kate Moss</a>?

I dunno.

In all fairness, though, I guess the celeb really doesn't know the designer label because he or she generally has a stylist that does the shopping. It's just sometimes hard to fathom, though, given that Hollywood is about nothing but fantasy and self-absorbency.

A couple years ago, Rosie O'Donnell was gracious enough to let me check the label of her blazer because she didn't know who she was wearing.  That I she asked me had to actually had to comb my fingers through the tresses near her nape to find Adrienne Vittadini's  name is a rare invitation from a celebrity.

Usually, the carpet is so crowded and time so limited that if the celebrity says she doesn't know, you just have to take her at her word. She's either not telling because she's putting on the pretense that she has so much clothing that how could she possibly keep up with the names. <strong>OR</strong> ...

I really have not come up with a plausible answer for the "or," given that I know so well—and often personify—the superficial female psyche.

If other women are anything like me, they know <em>every</em> designer in their wardrobe. Since I shop almost every day (including at Walmart for t-shirts), attend a lot of fashion shows, and have clothing given to me, who's wearing what becomes second nature. Even when I'm stumped, I experience an epiphany later.

Coincidentally, while shopping online I later found out that Jennifer Hudson was wearing a Diane von Furstenberg dress one night, and on another night while at the House of Blues I knew she was wearing Charlotte Olympia pumps because of their distinct shape. Also, von Furstenberg dresses have a consistent contour and line. She designs a lot of ruched and wrap dresses. What usually differs are the patterns, colors and materials, although the latter is most often jersey.

However, I did believe Rosie was clueless that day because aside from her bewilderment she really isn't that fashion conscious. But many of us are, for me only at certain times due to my photo work.

Due to her weight struggles, she knew that she was wearing <a href="http://www.spanx.com/shop/spanx/legwear/cat-38-catid-tn_spx_leg" target="_blank">Spanx leggings</a>; and because Oprah often wore the red-sole shoes, which Rosie sought to mimic,  she also knew she was wearing Christian Louboutin booties, although she couldn't remember the designer's name.

Most fashion-conscious women familiar with <a href="http://www.neimanmarcus.com/Christian-Louboutin/Shoes/cat39620738_cat43240842_cat000199/c.cat?navAction=index" target="_blank">Louboutins</a> know them when they see them (even when they are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FA0Ei-f1w0" target="_blank">knock-0ffs</a>). What I thought was informative that night is that the booties were no more than two inches high. At that point, I hadn't been able to find any Louboutins in any height less than a four-inch heel because, let's face it, in my line of work where speed and agility can make or break a photo opportunity, I can't afford to have my feet aching at the end of the day or catching a six-inch heel in my camera gear.

And forget about walking.

If you do enough of it, as I did last Saturday night, by the time your night is over your feet are throbbing. But I actually did pretty well in the black-suede pair of  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ysls" target="_blank">YSLs</a> I was wearing because they are wedges. A male colleague asked me, "How in the world can you walk in those stilettos?"

First of all, I'm a former ballet dancer, so I'm used to being on what are now my ugly toes. Secondly, they aren't stilettos; they're wedges. Big difference. With wedges you have much more stability because there's more substantial  heel. Get your fashion facts straight!

Most times, I wear sneakers (designer, of course) or <a href="http://www.drmartens.com/us/Womens/c/Womens" target="_blank">Doc Martens</a> combat boots because they're durable and somewhat stylish; but more important they're <strong>flat</strong>. In my photography work, I always have to battle between fashionable and practicality. Usually, the latter wins.

Not that the fuschia floor-length gown with plunging V neckline and cap sleeves actress Holly Robinson Peete wore was practical (even night gowns rarely are!). Just ask <a href="https://twitter.com/Kmharvey" target="_blank">Karli Harvey</a>, daughter of comedian Steve Harvey, who lamented that she needed a handler to help move the train on her dress down the red carpet.

But she knew <em>what</em> she was wearing: "<a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/black-halo?cm_mmc=google-_-Dresses_Brands-_-Black_Halo-_-black%20halo_e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=e&amp;creative=27448027102&amp;rkg_id=h-a33e87a8ef73c07902bc1dce17d182c1_t-1399386513&amp;adpos=1t2&amp;gclid=CMvogYDBl74CFe47MgodaHAAEA" target="_blank">Black Halo</a>," Robinson Peete announced confidently.
