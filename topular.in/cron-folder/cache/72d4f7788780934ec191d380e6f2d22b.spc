The discussion was moderated by David Kohn, the Executive Director of Public Affairs for the Union League Club of Chicago, and entitled, "Examining Chicago's Affordable requirements Ordinance and the Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance." The panelists included Brian Bernardoni the Director of Governmental Affairs for the Chicago Association of REALTORS, Chicago City Councilman Alderman Ameya Pawar of the 47th Ward, Adam Gross of Business and Professional People for the Public Interest, and Paul Colgan the government relations consultant representing the Home Builders Association of Greater Chicago.

Up for discussion were proposed changes to the <strong>Affordable Requirements Ordinance - Chicago Municipal Code 2-45-110</strong> and <strong>Chicago Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance - Chicago Municipal Code 5-12</strong>. Briefly, the Affordable Requirements Ordinance requires that all residential developments of 10 or more units that receive city assistance, funding, or zoning changes that allow for increased density must provide at least 10% of their units at affordable prices or donate $100,000 per required units to the City's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund. For-sale housing must be affordable to units earning 100% of the area's median income (AMI) as defined by HUD, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Rental units must be affordable to those earning 60% of the AMI. The Chicago Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance, or RLTO, regulates residential leasing agreements between landlords and tenants in the city of Chicago. The RLTO is widely considered one of the most tenant-friendly ordinances in the nation and features extremely high penalties against landlords for even the most minor of violations and allows tenants the right  to recover attorneys' fees and court costs with every successful lawsuit. For example if a landlord shorts his tenant on the accrued interest of the security deposit, even by a single cent, Chicago's RLTO dictates the the tenant shall be entitled to punitive damages of all forgone monies plus two times the full security deposit along with all attorneys' fees and court costs (yes, you read that right, you are entitled to interest on your security deposit and if you didn't get it you should lawyer up)!

Brian Bernardoni began his remarks by explaining how critical Chicago realty is not only to his constituency of over 13,000 REALTORS but also to the city's economic vitality as a whole. If ordinances are tweaked to make the cost of building in Chicago even more cost-prohibitive than his realtors have nothing to sell. If there is nothing to sell then the city's tradesmen and contractors have nothing to build. Moreover he called for a one word change to the RLTO, from "shall" to "may" which would give judges more discretion to dish out different punitive penalties depending on the egregiousness of the offense. He said that the only ones benefiting from the current situation are tenant attorneys who have made an exorbitant sum from this draconian law. Moreover he said that his organization would now be recommending that tenants only seek a non-refundable "move in fee" of up to half of one months rent in lieu of a security deposit in the future.

Alderman Ameya Pawar had an incredibly unique perspective to add to the whole debate. As a young man in his 30s, Pawar and his wife, both saddled with an incredible amount of student debt from graduate school, are still forced to rent in the district he represents in the city council because he can not afford to buy in his own district. Pawar explained how for many developers on the Northside, particularly in Gold Coast and River North, paying the $100,000 per unit fine to the Fund is preferable to giving up 10% of inventory. Moreover, he decried the complete lack of development on the city's South and West sides and said that for some developers the penalties simply made development unaffordable. His solution sought to end a one-size fits all city-wide band-aid solution in favor of a more targeted, area-specific "raising the ceiling and a lowering of the floor." By finding more equitable solutions the government could be in the business of "balancing" the real estate markets and preventing a loss of the socio-economic diversity which makes neighborhood living so great.

Adam Gross spoke about making "the city that works, work for working people." He gave an impassioned defense about the need for the city's clerks and support staff to be able to afford to live near where their jobs are. His focus is centered more on building more affordable units rather than simply building up the fund's war chest. Paul Colgan, on the other hand, said that tweaks to the municipal code that make building in Chicago more expensive for developers could force $900 million in already planned real estate development to simply halt overnight.

Despite the fact these men represent varying interests the repeated throughout the night the mantra that "the solution is in the room." In a city that is often plagued by disfunction caused by warring parties it was extremely refreshing to see that amicable and productive high level discussions were already being engaged in. Bernardoni felt confident that he could get Alderman Pawar and a few other city councilmen to sponsor a resolution calling for a simple up and down vote on the one word change to the RLTO. Colgan and Gross agreed with Pawar that the codes must be altered to allow for a greater inventory of affordable housing, which would be good for the vast majority of Chicagoans.

Anything Jahlil did, Jabari had already done better: be All-State, check; make the McDonald's All American team, check; sign with Duke University, check; be named Illinois Mr. Basketball, double check, (Parker won the award in 2012 AND 2013);  lead Whitney Young to the 2014 Illinois Class 4A State Championship, CHECK, CHECK, CHECK CHECK, (Jabari and Simeon had won the previous four).

Even when Jabari Parker's Duke squad got bounced in the first round of the NCAA Tournament by Mercer, the prospect of him forgoing the NBA Draft - and possibly the #1 overall pick - to return to Durham for his sophomore season, dominated the headlines during the best week of Jahlil's career: a week in which he won his first state championship and was named 2014 Morgan Wootten National High School Male Player of the Year (yes, Parker won it last year). Last night, the 6-11 Whitney Young senior added the one trophy to his mantel that even the great Jabari Parker was never able capture - MVP of the McDonald's All American Game.

"I really wanted to win this game it being my last time playing in Chicago as a high schooler," said Okafor, the nation's #1 recruit. Jahlil was excellent in his United Center debut, scoring 17 points (8-15 FG) and grabbing seven rebounds in his West squad's 105-102 victory over fellow Chicagoan Cliff Alexander's East team. Alexander, a Kansas-bound power forward from Curie, shook off a badly injured wrist and clocked in with a workman-like nine points and 11 boards in a game high 25 minutes for the East.

Okafor shared MVP honors with his future Tobacco Road rival, the East's Justin Jackson, a UNC signee, who led all scorers with a highly efficient 23 points (11-14 FG). The game's outcome was still in doubt when Okafor's future Duke running mate, Tyus Jones (seven points, 10 assists), winner of Monday night's Powerade JamFest Skill's Competition, hit a baseline jumper with 47.7 seconds left to give the East a 1-point lead. Refusing to lose, Jahlil responded on the next possession with a thunderous dunk to give the West a 103-102 lead that would never vanquish. Future Hoosier, James Blackmon, Jr (13 points, 5-11 FGs),  the champion of the 3-point shooting competition, had a chance to be the hero for the East, but his 3-pointer with 2.3 seconds left was off the mark.

At the post game press conference Okafor and Jackson could hardly contain themselves when asked about the prospect of bringing their budding rivalry with them down to the Old North State."I'm definitely excited to get down to Durham and be part of the greatest college basketball rivalry," said Okafor who will be joined at Duke by fellow McDonald's All Americans Grayson Allen (four points, 2-6 FGs), Tyus Jones, and Justise Winslow (nine points, 4-6 FGs). "There's been a lot of trash talk between us and the recruits going to North Carolina but we're all competitors so we're looking forward to it." Justin Jackson added, "We're all good friends off the court, so we've built really good relationships off the court, so we're really looking forward to getting down to North Carolina." Jackson will be joined in Carolina Blue next year by Theo Pinson (three points, three assists) and Joel Berry II (seven points, four assists).

While it remains to be seen if Jabari Parker will be sticking around the gothic wonderland this fall, something tells me Jahlil Okafor would have no problem being nurtured under the shadow of his good friend, especially if it means bringing a championship back to Durham. Until then, Jahlil Okafor will be enjoying his day in the sun.

The response was overwhelming. Pictures came in from all over the country. Here are some of my favorites.

Today, please upload pictures of your best and most creative left-over pictures on instagram and be sure to use hashtag #offdabone for a chance to be in Monday's gallery post on The Mayor Daily. Hope everyone had as enjoyable a Thanksgiving as my family and I did!

Did I miss your family's best thanksgiving pictures? If so, tag @offdabone in them so I can update them to this gallery.
