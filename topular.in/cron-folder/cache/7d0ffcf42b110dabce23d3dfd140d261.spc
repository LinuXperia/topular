Fox News immediately disputed these claims through a series of fair-and-balanced memes about Trump. In one, Fox anchor Megyn Kelly is pictured with the caption: “Trump’s Kryptonite: Any woman without a pre-nup.”

Another featured Trump’s campaign headquarters filled with a huge quantity of unsold “Making America Great Again” halter tops. The caption: “Chapter 8 protection sought for Trump Web store.”

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus would not comment on recent Republican anti-endorsements but confirmed hearing big donors may sit out the Presidential election and focus instead on winning the <i>American Idol</i> voting.

“As RNC chairman, I must remain neutral, but I will say it’s a national outrage no Christian rock singer in 15 seasons has ever passed the Freak Show audition stage,” Priebus said. “But if America can put a black man in the White House, I’m certain we can ram a Christian rocker down Hollywood’s throat."

Speculation about the RNC’s preferred rocker quickly centered on Toby T. Tobes of Glendale, Arizona. Tobes’ Instagram account describes him as a one-boy <a href="http://www.newsboys.com/" target="_blank">Newsboys</a> but without any of the Australian band’s distressing foreign after-taste.

Political observers expect the RNC to deploy its substantial phone bank to tip weekly votes in Tobes’ favor. In addition, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, Papa John’s Pizza and the Hobby Lobby are combining to create a super Super-PAC to fund pro-Tobes commercials during American Idol and at gun shows nationwide.

“Tobes is a very attractive young man. Very attractive,” Dole said less dolefully. “Reminds me of a young Bob Dole if a young Bob Dole could sing birdlike in tongues. But as always, winning <i>Idol</i> comes down to song choice. If he avoids anything Stryper or John Tesh, I think he’ll do fine.”

In rapid succession, she trotted out every catch phrase and folksy hate rhyme ever used in her popular series of biker gang books.

“Totally cool,” said Chauncy Kinsella, an unemployed son of a local farmer. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/fluffington-post/files/2016/01/palin-trump.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8532 alignleft" style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 12px;" alt="palin trump" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/fluffington-post/files/2016/01/palin-trump-170x300.jpg" width="170" height="300" /></a>“It felt like hearing the Spin Doctors at the county fair play all of their greatest hits. There was ‘drill baby drill,’ ‘you betcha,’ ‘going rouge.’ I taped it all. Easily saved me $2.97 in ring tone downloads.”

Off the record, Trump campaign insiders said Palin’s endorsement was designed specifically as a finger in the eye to Ted Cruz and anyone with more than a 9<sup>th</sup> grade reading level.

“It’s part of our super awesome <i>Back to the Future</i> strategy,” said Merry Lee Petticoat, a Trump spokesperson and former <i>Apprentice</i> contestant. “This morning, John Wayne’s daughter endorsed us, and in the days to come, I’ve lined up Joe the Plumber, Robin Leach, MC Skat Kat from those Paula Abdul videos, and one of Clara “Where’s the Beef” Peller’s 42 grandchildren. It’s going to be a lot fun.”

The endorsement reminded the public of just how much havoc John McCain unleashed when his presidential campaign ignored spray painted warnings and freed Palin from the crystal meth brewing tank to which they found her chained in Wasilla, Alaska.

John McCain’s office did not return calls for comment but did reissue for the 49<sup>th</sup> time a two-word press release that read, “I apologize.”

“It’s part of our super awesome <i>Back to the Future</i> strategy,” said Merry Lee Petticoat, a Trump spokesperson and former <i>Apprentice</i> contestant. “This morning, John Wayne’s daughter endorsed us, and in the days to come, I’ve lined up Joe the Plumber, Robin Leach, MC Skat Kat from those Paula Abdul videos, and one of Clara “Where’s the Beef” Peller’s 42 grandchildren. It’s going to be a lot fun.”

The endorsement reminded the public of just how much havoc John McCain unleashed when his presidential campaign ignored spray painted warnings and freed Palin from the crystal meth brewing tank to which they found her chained in Wasilla, Alaska.

John McCain’s office did not return calls for comment but did reissue for the 49<sup>th</sup> time a two-word press release that read, “I apologize.”

Scalia’s ruling was signed onto by Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sam Alito. Justice Clarence Thomas concurred by affixing his customary thumb print.

Following the ruling, former candidates Scott Walker, Rick Perry, and Bobby Jindal all re-entered the GOP race. With the field suddenly thinned to four, initial Iowa polls had Ted Cruz falling to fourth.

The special will be simulcast in Russia under the title “Crimea Make Embrace of Christmas or be Crushed.” Most of the Trump portions will be replaced with live musical numbers performed by Putin’s Apparatchik Holiday Players.

Iger said ABC will air the third Democratic Debate at 3 o’clock Christmas morning immediately after ABC burns off remaining episodes of the cancelled Don Johnson drama <i>Blood &amp; Oil</i>.

“The Democrats have only themselves to blame,” he said. “Given their childish stubbornness to debate like adults, they’re lucky we don’t stick them on Disney Junior. We would have, except Bernie Sanders freaks out kids when he smiles.”

The special will be simulcast in Russia under the title “Crimea Make Embrace of Christmas or be Crushed.” Most of the Trump portions will be replaced with live musical numbers performed by Putin’s Apparatchik Holiday Players.

Iger said ABC will air the third Democratic Debate at 3 o’clock Christmas morning immediately after ABC burns off remaining episodes of the cancelled Don Johnson drama <i>Blood &amp; Oil</i>.

“The Democrats have only themselves to blame,” he said. “Given their childish stubbornness to debate like adults, they’re lucky we don’t stick them on Disney Junior. We would have, except Bernie Sanders freaks out kids when he smiles.”

Separately, a spokesperson for ISIS said the Obama Administration’s horrible handling of the healthcare.gov website did more than anything to radicalize jihadis.

“Nothing enrages Muslim warriors more than Obama’s ham-handed attempt to give health insurance to millions of American infidels,” the spokesperson said. “I mean, who does he think he is? An emperor or something?”

Priebus was also asked if Obama won the Republican presidential nomination as a write-in candidate, would Priebus support Obama.

“It’s a silly question. He will not be the nominee.”

The unanimous prayer was offered after a slight delay to allow NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre to review and approve.<img class="alignright" style="margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" alt="" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/fluffington-post/files/2012/09/FluffPost-logo.jpg" width="258" height="111" align="left" />

“I’m deeply offended by criticism of our prayer,” Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said. “My belief in the power of prayer is almost as strong as my belief that unrestricted political donations from the NRA have absolutely no effect on my unqualified support for whatever positions they request of us.”

LaPierre disputed he had any input into the GOP prayer. He also lashed out at President Barack Obama for crassly trying to leverage the tragedy for his own benefit.

“It’s despicable. The San Bernardino shooting occurred during an office Christmas party. If only everyone at that party carried a sidearm ordered from the NRA’s Christmas Gift Catalog – available online at <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">www.AlliWantForChristmasAreTwoNRAGuns.com</span> – this tragedy could have been somewhat lessened,” he said.

The San Bernardino shooting represented the 352nd multiple-victim shooting in the U.S. this year. These accounted for more than 460 American deaths and more than 1,300 injured.

Just four weeks ago, the GOP demanded bold action from President Obama to respond to the death of 120 Frenchmen in Paris, but Wednesday, Republican lawmakers cautioned against any emotional response to curb the carnage on the homefront.

Response from Democratic presidential candidates varied widely. Democratic presidential nominee Bernie Sanders urged both sides of the gun debate to stop yelling and screaming at each other.

“I REPEAT! STOP THE YELLING AND SCREAMING! I CAN BARELY EVEN HEAR MYSELF SCREAM ABOUT THIS NATION'S PROFOUND INCOME INEQUALITY,” he said via Twitter.

Hillary Clinton urged her “Republican friends” to put a sock in their grandstanding.

“I suggest every Republican try putting themselves in the shoes of a shooting target,” she said. “That’s exactly what I did when I imagined coming under gun fire in Bosnia. It was a profound experience, especially as the senator from New York during the 9/11 attacks.”

The unanimous prayer was offered after a slight delay to allow NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre to review and approve.<img class="alignright" style="margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-right: 0px;" alt="" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/fluffington-post/files/2012/09/FluffPost-logo.jpg" width="258" height="111" align="left" />

“I’m deeply offended by criticism of our prayer,” Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said. “My belief in the power of prayer is almost as strong as my belief that unrestricted political donations from the NRA have absolutely no effect on my unqualified support for whatever positions they request of us.”

LaPierre disputed he had any input into the GOP prayer. He also lashed out at President Barack Obama for crassly trying to leverage the tragedy for his own benefit.
