The toll for loving a dog is the certainty that we will be their ushers when their life is nearing the end. We pay with loss and sadness.And here I am. Heartbroken.

Milly died yesterday, and I cannot see the floor for my tears.  I have thrown her bowl to the bottom of the trash, but I cannot clear her stuff yet.  I cannot speak to my friends and family.  I am awash with grief.

It took two years after Chamois died before I was ready to reopen my heart.  Mabel was 5, and we have always had two dogs..a security measure so we will never be alone.  I scouted her, begged the breeder for her, and drove to Wisconsin one day after a European trip to bring her home.  She was Marshview Kennel's Fergie, from a litter of F pups.  By the time Steve and I reached the Illinois border, she was Milly.  Milly and Mabel- my bookends.

She had a ridiculous underbite that didn't show up until her big girl teeth came in.  Mabel hated her immediately, crushing her snout so she wheezed until the day she died. She was not a looker, but more of a Muppet dog. Her spirited heart was uncrushable.  Almost. Soon Mabel was curling up with her, chasing balls with her, and tolerating the competition.  Mabel remained the Alpha, despite the fact that she is now 14, tumorous and arthritic.  Milly's kind soul dictated that Mabel could dwell in the glory days where she was first to get the frisbee. But at night, Milly would amble up on the bed that Mabel cannot conquer, and she would let the Old Dog know that she was making accommodations.  Mabel appreciated the deference.

She gave licks, I gave Kit Kats.[/caption]

Milly let me dress her in Halloween Costumes, wore a Christmas collar with bells, allowed me to experiment (badly) with dog grooming clippers and never snapped at a baby- even if that baby had a death grip on her whiskers.  Henry has a hard time napping, and she would nestle in with him and keep him company while he slept.  No door scratching, just snuggling for her. She could locate a candy wrapper in any paper basket and loved strewing all other contents to get her licks in.  She was an accomplished counter surfer with a preference for starch.  Eight hot dog buns would evaporate in moments, and she did not leave a crumb.  If only she had learned to hide the bag, her thefts would be the perfect crime.

Two weeks ago I pulled the attic stairs down to grab some items for Pat.  Steve was in California, and so at bedtime, I called to let her out.  No Milly. I called like a shrill idiot, opened all the closets.  I phoned Pat to ask if he had let her run away before he drove off.  I envisioned her being hit by a car (premonitions of death?) and started dialing the police to see if there had been a pick up. Then I thought to pull the ladder down, and voila! Milly almost leapt from the opening.  She had not barked, whined, scratched.  Because she was Milly, happiest dog in the world, and she was sure I would come for her. That is a pet for the ages. my happy little girl.

She never had a crabby day.  She followed me everywhere.  Her love was unconditional.  She forgave me the days I forgot to feed her, the rough brushing I had to do after periods of benign neglect, incarceration in the attic, sequestration from toddlers. Mostly she forgave me when I went away and left her without her favored playmate, me.

Sunday, when I came home from a weekend away, she did not bound into my path. My heart rate ramped.

I knew.

I made her some rice broth, gave her fresh water.  She ignored the broth, sucked up the water and promptly vomited.

Steve ditched the Bears and carried her to the car.  Countryside has a new Veterinary Clinic- I swear, I see the hand of God in its proximity. They were like angels to us.

Rapid diagnosis via ultrasound: Tumor, burst. Edema to compensate, filling up the chest cavity. Pained breathing, heart stress.  As fast as they could drain the fluid it filled up.  She was too weak to wag.

So we did what we are charged to do- love her, let her go. We held her, nuzzled her, she went to sleep. It was peaceful. It was awful. I am inconsolable.

Because Milly was a smile in every single day for the last 8 years, I am diminished. Steve and I are alone in the house; our rituals are interwoven with our pets. We rise and sleep on their schedule.  We eat at the same time. They welcome us with the same level of adoration whether we have been at the grocery store or away for a week.  She has been my roommate for months when Steve is in Florida, and she was excellent company.

Every motion I have made today is a lonesome move.  One of her beds is at my feet as I type, with a telling biscuit left behind.  She was too sick for a treat.  Mabel has ignored it. Poor Milly.

Poor me. Poor Steve.  Even poor Mabel, who goes outside and looks back expecting to see her curly little shadow. At almost 14, her date with destiny cannot be far off.  Hell, we have to pave the stairs with Velveeta every night so Mabel has the will to climb.

I thought that typing this would make me feel better, and it has not.

Time will soothe me, I know that. I just needed to proclaim: my chipper little Portuguese Water Dog was a gift that eased a complicated decade for Steve and me.  She was always by our sides, looking up with her crazy smile and dedicated affection.  She loved the kids, she loved Mabel and she loved every moment of her day.  (Mostly those with food or treats) She had puppy energy and bounce until the weekend she died.

So there's that

Now I am U turning to California to disassemble Roger Dahl's life- a human life.  I feel squirrelly memorializing Milly before I have gathered words for Roger.  Still, I have no guilt. Milly gave me about 3000 days of comfort and happiness. No matter how we scolded her, she never withheld affection.  The simplicity of a dog's love is affirming.  I owe her a good send off.

I started June with a shiny new baby granddaughter, celebrated the joyous weddings of two nieces in Detroit and Colorado, and am now involved in the Autumnal imagery of imminent death.

There has been plenty to talk about.  SImple joys of grilled food and babysitting, sunny skies, good books, family joy. But I have not written.

Melancholy? Maybe a little.  Lazy?  Maybe a lot.

What chilled my zest for this space is actually my deep love of reading and writing, of words and their power. I'm an addict.  I wake at 6 and read a bizarre mix of papers on my phone.  I check up on my family and friends on FB and often click their links to read what is important to them. Then I roll out and read the papers on my porch.  Afternoons have some nooks for books or magazines.  I traipse through minefields of opposing opinions and try to grasp what we might have  in common.

There is no goal for this.  I do not use much of what I read, but it satisfies my curiosity.  I explore as a neutral bystander.  I particularly admire journalists because their words are meticulously chosen.  Reporters will be standing by their words. They have the pressure to research, ask questions, confirm.

The opinion pages I can take or leave: if I work to know the truth, I can form my own opinion.  A big IF.

This summer, the Ferguson shooting and the invective it unleashed pried my eyes open to our new reality: every person now has a platform for his opinion.We all pose as experts.  Too often our opinions are formed in a snap, with a millimeter of depth.  Facts are irrelevant, or too inconvenient to find. A tiny piece of a puzzle is presented as the entirety. Research is work, talk is natural.  Our bias and loyalty seasons the mix. The words lather and overflow. People become calcified in their positions. Because the  images from Missouri were so disturbing, people from all mindsets immediately declared a boy a thug, a cop a killer.  There was no patience for peeling the onion, so to speak.  No chance for understanding, or change. This is what we are now: yippers and snappers.

I am horrified. Our consideration is a mile wide and an inch deep. Is this what standardized testing hath wrought?  Or are we armed with the smug knowledge that a few keystrokes can bring us to a wiki that we can quote with certainty? We don't go deep. We go loud.

For whatever reason, we bring the same degree of scrutiny-and heat- to the ISIL crisis that we do to a football game.

Politics has always been fertilized by wars of words, ( brown suit, presidential golf dates,  dog and coffee cup salutes being the current outrages) but now the minutiae of everyday life is subject to debates.   Moms defend their choices, haircuts and clothing are dissected, gossip is created or shared with an instant verdict: bad mom, ugly person, slut. Ug.

Blogging is just one outlet for this cacophony, but as it is MY outlet, I needed to step back.  I am still pondering whether my life bears scrutiny, and is worth your valuable time. I am embarrassed for the times I have pushed my opinion upon you.

So now I am asking myself, what can I add to your day?

Just my meanderings.

I am white noise. For some, that noise soothes, but for others it irritates.  Do I have lessons? Insight? Joy?  ( I certainly have no recipes) Because I do not wish to waste your time. Or mine.

I am tiptoeing alongside my father-in-law Roger  as he dies, and perhaps this is the biggest reason for my introspection.  We only get so many days. Living them to the edges is the goal.

Talking about them - that is far down the bucket list.

SO please wait for me to come out of this cave.  I'll be around. Maybe I'll steal a recipe from someone that will change your world. It could happen.

<em></em>Hamlet, William Shakespeare, the ultimate Dead Poet.

I have to take a little pause in my self involved tale of going home to acknowledge the passing of Robin Williams.

My heart is broken by his deep sadness and his terrible hopelessness.

Robin Williams was a chameleon, and his various incarnations wriggled into the  lives of every one of us. I would be agitated by his manic comedy, admiring his whip fast brain, but I was cognizant that mania's counterpoint would feel hollow and silent. I loved how his gentle spirit slid into his many movie roles, and his intelligence strobed behind those blue eyes. He leaves a legacy of films that will stay with us forever. God only knows what amazing things he would have shared with us had he only gathered the strength to go on.

The stories of his kindness and accessibility to the sick, the struggling, even the random stranger have crushed me.

I have never suffered from depression, but people I love have.

Among them....

In 1988, my Mom, always a sturdy compass for her brood, fell into a pit. She was moving from the home she raised her kids in and was fixated on the notion that her life as a useful person was over. She had a heart condition, and was being treated with beta blockers and was generally over-whelmed by the chore of living.  My Dad, not given to sympathy, told her to buck up.

That was not the answer.

She visited me in Chicago during this time, and the pain was etched on her face.  She was gray, listless. She slumped. I had a new Golden Retriever puppy at the time, and cuddling Chamois brought a tidbit of sparkle  into her day, but it evaporated like a bubble. She was so, so sad.

Now we realize that the prescriptions that save you from dying can create intense fatigue, replicating depression. They could also block serotonin, which is essential to feelings of well being. Counter programming is a must. For Mom, the abyss was temporary: she found peace through adjustments to her medication, and she got well.  Her breach was not chronic, but it was a shocking detour from her general optimism. We did not know what to do, or how to help. The last 25 years have brought much illumination to the disease of depression, but there is no universal cure.

My other close contact with this imbalance is of course, my soulmate.  For years he self-medicated feelings of inadequacy or unworthiness with Jack Daniels and illicit drugs.  He referred to his inner being as a person I would not want to know, much less love.  He refused to tell me his darkest thoughts, because he said they would scare me.  I was the essential Pollyanna.  I believed he was just a party animal with no governor.  In 1995, he looked at our boys, and realized that he needed to re-balance his life and deal with his demons, he stopped self-medicating.  Cold turkey. Hasn't relapsed once.

That was not the cure for the underlying depression. It was the start.

Steve has spent the better part of 19 years seeking to re-route the things that weigh him down.  He has sought medical assistance and has used prescription medications to re-wire his brain. Did you know that the very same <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/wellbutrin-drug.htm">meds</a> that alleviate depression can stimulate thoughts of suicide?  It is a thicket, that road to mental health. Steve now also has cognitive therapy and meditation in his arsenal.  It is working for him, for us. For now. Forever, we hope.

It doesn't,  always. And sometimes the most buttressed person can stumble back into the darkness.

That is where supportive circles come in:  AA, family, co-workers, friends.  The cruel irony is that depressed people withdraw so their pain is not seen or shared. Or they pretend as they plot to fade away. Or harm another.  It is a cruel burden to all involved. Sometimes it is fatal.

Steve has me, his sturdy watch dog.  Yet after Monday's newsreels ran, ascribing Robin William's suicide to lost fame, cancelled shows, failed marriages and so on, I realized that Steve had also navigated land mines over the last 5 years: the loss of his radio platform, his brother's and mother's deaths. A difficult, fraught-with-peril tech start up. Isolation from the city he loved as he worked in the basement. I had thought to ask him if he was tempted to drink when times were rugged. He assured me that he had no wish to add pain to misfortune. That was music to my ears.

Last Monday, I realized with some guilt that I had<strong> never</strong> asked him if he had contemplated suicide.  Maybe I did not wish to know the inner darkness of a man who warned me of his cock-eyed thought patterns.

But it was time to ask.  It was weird to feel  jangling stress in a conversation with my husband of 36 years. On our anniversary, no less.

He said no. Never.

I exhaled.

I know all depression does not lead to that choice. I also know that we have complicated mental processing systems, and they are not constant. It is possible to slide into a pit and get out with help, or it is possible to have the pit cave in. So the conversation must be ongoing for those who struggle and their help mates.

Still there is no guarantee. But for those fortunate enough to see the world with the sun in every day, don't judge.  Monitor and surround anyone you love who suffers. Intrude upon their shell. And know that there may still be cataclysmic failure. Or triumph. We are fragile. We are iron clad.  Often in alternating episodes.

A person suffering with profound depression cannot process joy.  External difficulties compound despair, but do not trigger the hard-wired illness Robin Williams struggled valiantly against. The heart meds and Parkinson's disease further challenged his particular system to remain balanced. Perhaps his metabolism and brain wiring might have regulated themselves if he held on.  He could not.

It is a problem of the ages, this depression. Shakespeare wrote of it in many poems and plays, but his most famous and unsalvaged character was a Danish prince:

From Hamlet:

<em>I have of late,—but wherefore I know not,—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither...</em>

To Robin Williams,<em> Good Night Sweet Prince. And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.</em>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Janet Dahl";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7097:"<em>To sleep, perchance to dream.

It is a chance to rejoice in our roots and see the future in our kids.  I'm from Royal Oak- I could torture the roots, trunk, branches and acorn metaphor to death as I am inclined to do. But I'll spare you.

The last weekend of July, Steve and I  traveled back in time and geography to Detroit. We packed up our party clothes and headed home...to <em>my</em> childhood home that is.

My beautiful niece Caitlin married her wonderful Ben in the very same church we were married in 37 years ago, Shrine of the Little Flower.

It was on a perfect Friday evening, as my wedding was. Caitlin dressed in the living room of the home I dressed in on August 11, 1978: her mom, the baby of my family now lives there.  (<em>Of course, I tripped and ripped the lace at the hem of my gown, and in Janet form, sewed it back on with dental floss.  The thing was $200 bucks worth of polyester, never meriting an heirlooming.  It is currently in a plastic bag in the attic, and I gotta say- it hasn't yellowed one bit. And the dental floss held well. Why do I keep it?  Dunno.  No daughters...though I did cut a piece of lace off for Mary to put in her baby book on the occasion of her Baptism) </em>

The wedding co-celebrated the anniversary of Caitlin's parents, the aforementioned sister Marie and her husband Larry. Their  wedding, in the same church 34 years earlier, had occasioned an epic sulk by Steve triggered by an ill-fitting suit and noose-like tie.  This mood was ameliorated by a generous and unguarded act of spontaneous love..no, distraction...by yours truly, which then resulted in Patrick Joliat Dahl.

So the date was special.  Reminiscent and fateful. Beautifully full of love incarnate.

Steve has matured, found new appreciation for and by my family, and no longer hates ties. (His pants still were a bit of a noose, and a belt provided security in the event of a button pop.)  He bought some Finn Comfort shoes so he wouldn't suffer podiatrically.  He did not complain once during the drive.  He sat in his pew like a model Catholic. (Ha) Listened to my tales of daily Mass, and first Penance. Shuffled me to the Usher's room when I had a coughing fit so I wouldn't wreck the video. Posed for dual selfies at the scene of our marriage. Enlisted the Mother of the Bride to take a picture. Then he whisked me off to the reception. He danced. Made small talk. Enjoyed the kids' dancing styles. Was an angel.

And then it was over. Well, almost over.  The reception ended at 12:30.  He wanted to go at 12:15.

Of course, I did not.  Every moment among my family seems a treasure to me; every moment seems like a party to him.  The subtle difference between these two perspectives is a gap that we did not effectively bridge. I pouted. He stewed.

I wanted those extra moments, and he wanted appreciation for the 375 minutes he had given me.  In hindsight, the "give" of 15 minutes, and the "get" of a happy Janet would probably lead Steve to capitulate.  I'm not so sure I would be as generous.

I think both of our positions are reasonable.  Reasonable minds are free to differ.  I was wistful, not angry.

But it became a fight. Such a detour after a fairy tale evening.

The good news is we were able to  navigate the "why" of our divergence. 36 years of marriage have taught us to fight fair, listen and shift as needed. <em>(Truth told, we have differing styles: Steve likes to fight to a resolution and cannot sleep unless strife is over; I have fallen asleep during Battles Royale, and awaken with no edge or need to resume life in the bunker.  Steve used my magic slate to his advantage in the drinking days...but he cannot use it to end a skirmish.

I will continue with this Janter in the next few days. This episode awakened some subconscious complications in me, things that my German half forces the Irish quarter to suppress. My Irish melancholy  is really clawing its way to the surface as I age.    I am sentimental, maybe even given to maudlin thoughts.  Heavens, I have no clue what my Swiss/French quarter is up to.  Perhaps they are neutral. That's good.

It took me two weeks to write about our trip. I apologize. I often think my Granny/Janny observations are too trivial to bug you with. ....but I'd still appreciate it if you stop back. I'm getting catharsis, and so I am grateful for the platform. Besides, don't you want to know the rest of the story? Then you can be armed for your return to your roots.

I have always been available for emergency babysitting, and my initial offer was to be the Friday overnight drop off babysitter for any of the kids. They could go out and not worry about  early Saturday morning. Steve works hard these days: he rejoices in being stapled to the home front on Friday night: Undercover Boss, Shark Tank, Blue Bloods, Malnati's and bed. The addition of a few babies would double the fun.  No one ever took us up on it: it was a hassle to come to Western Springs then ricochet back downtown.

This year brought Pat and Rachel to the suburbs, and their child care needs pivoted. They were in residence with the Donaldsons for the Autumn, and with me in the winter. (Steve hung out in Florida until April- a genius.) At any rate, it was "all hands on deck" time for childcare.  I took Tuesdays, and Rachel's folks continued with their Fridays.  I was a little insecure about this new responsibility: Henry is a bolt of energy and my failed knee replacement makes me wobble when I should be sturdy. Hearing a two year old say "Bye" as he unlocks the front door strikes terror into any Gramma. But a Gram who needs to make a pup tent to get off the floor has a distinct 3 second disadvantage.

I should not have worried.  Henry has been patient and gentle with good old Gramma Janet. Things are going swimmingly. Our current rage is Henryville, a play mat for cars, planes, helicopters and emergency equipment. He loves being the Fire Chief.

Henry has trained me well. Yesterday he and I had a solo morning while Rachel went to the doctor.  His goal for the day was elemental: he wanted jello, a forbidden food that caught his eye the week before as we passed the take out section of Marianos. Of course I bought it.  And he polished off the tub. Those jiggly red cubes represented an exotic unknown entity in his organic life. To compound the adorableness of his request, he pronounces jello with the Spanish "l's" and the j becomes a y. Sure, it's fake food.  Mabel the wise dog would not accept his proffer of a cube last week, though Milly was grateful to share. This week, he wanted to expand from fake cherry to fake orange. Done. Popcorn for Grampa Steve, and off we went.

Part Two of our day expanded to Baby Violet. I was babysitter in chief for the afternoon. It's been a long time since I juggled an infant and toddler. I am happy to report that all survived. Steve was a little jealous (or worried) and so he popped in to visit. A girlfriend also came by to check out the new baby. Naps were taken, a bottle given, the baby was comforted to wait for Mama to feed her, and Henry and I made believe we were firefighters.  We saved babies and kittens. He then morphed into an UPS man, and delivered books to me to read. We are emphasizing sharing with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clark the Shark</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Llama Llama.</span>

Early  Tuesday, he discovered a relic of a camera in my purse, and he insisted on documenting our day.  His little fingers were determined to master the buttons, and he was dogged in his focus. His results are variable, but he is only 3 after all.

Below,  for your viewing pleasure are some highlights of Tuesdays with Grammy. We led with my manicure, hit Mariano's, returned home for lunch, nap, special guest Grampa and imagination time. I told him to ask his Dad for a Nikon.

I'm not sure what the future will bring for my Tuesdays. It has been a dose of joy.  The world a child sees is pure.  The questions they ask are innocent and lead an adult back to a gentler day. I have answered "What are angels?" and "Why do birds eat bugs?" as well as "Does Gramma Kathy see the same moon in Maine?"  I treasure every moment, every song, every story.  When his sweet heart sends love to the moon so Gramma Kathy can grab it from the  night sky, I want time to stand still.

I am sad that it will not.

Of course I bought it.  And he polished off the tub. Those jiggly red cubes represented an exotic unknown entity in his organic life. To compound the adorableness of his request, he pronounces jello with the Spanish "l's" and the j becomes a y. Sure, it's fake food.  Mabel the wise dog would not accept his proffer of a cube last week, though Milly was grateful to share. This week, he wanted to expand from fake cherry to fake orange. Done. Popcorn for Grampa Steve, and off we went.

Part Two of our day expanded to Baby Violet. I was babysitter in chief for the afternoon. It's been a long time since I juggled an infant and toddler. I am happy to report that all survived. Steve was a little jealous (or worried) and so he popped in to visit. A girlfriend also came by to check out the new baby. Naps were taken, a bottle given, the baby was comforted to wait for Mama to feed her, and Henry and I made believe we were firefighters.  We saved babies and kittens. He then morphed into an UPS man, and delivered books to me to read. We are emphasizing sharing with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clark the Shark</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Llama Llama.</span>

Early  Tuesday, he discovered a relic of a camera in my purse, and he insisted on documenting our day.  His little fingers were determined to master the buttons, and he was dogged in his focus. His results are variable, but he is only 3 after all.

Below,  for your viewing pleasure are some highlights of Tuesdays with Grammy. We led with my manicure, hit Mariano's, returned home for lunch, nap, special guest Grampa and imagination time. I told him to ask his Dad for a Nikon.

I'm not sure what the future will bring for my Tuesdays. It has been a dose of joy.  The world a child sees is pure.  The questions they ask are innocent and lead an adult back to a gentler day. I have answered "What are angels?" and "Why do birds eat bugs?" as well as "Does Gramma Kathy see the same moon in Maine?"  I treasure every moment, every song, every story.  When his sweet heart sends love to the moon so Gramma Kathy can grab it from the  night sky, I want time to stand still.

I am sad that it will not.

She is 8 days old, and beautiful. Apparently she was in a hurry to meet us, because she took only 3 hours from contraction #1 to<strong> TA DA!  </strong> Mommy never had her epidural, yet she was a trouper.

The week since her birth has found the Pat Dahl family reconfiguring life with grace and resolve. Henry seems aware that he has to share his parents, but he is an adaptive little adventurer.  Violet really doesn't do too much that interests him at the moment.  We made lists of all that he can do, and compared it with her routine of eat, sleep, cry, poo.  He seems to recognize that he has a richer life.  All of us are treating him like the prince that he is.

Violet was born at Hinsdale Adventist, where both her Mom and Dad made their debuts. Isn't that just the craziest thing, in this era of mobility? Two generations sharing a birthplace.  Imagine.

<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps that is why I am so <span style="font-size: 13px;">sentimental about the birth of this little treasure. This new addition takes me right back to a different era in my life.

Since Steve and I were without local family when Pat was born, we had no visitors in the hospital. We just nestled in to be a family.  I was so adrenalized that the Doctor gave me some Demerol so I would hush. (<em>I believe to this day that Steve begged him to do it.  I couldn't stop saying "A Boy! A Boy!"  I was in a euphoric zone. A loud one</em>) He said Pat would be tired, and I could use the rest before he found his lungs.  Steve went home. I rested, and the next day he stopped on his way to work, then snuck in after hours to lollygag with me.  We reformatted our lives in those first three days: I believe the lack of family visitors made us aware that we would need to depend upon each other.  <strong>We</strong> were a family. <strong>The</strong> family. We would make independent decisions, look out for our son, trust our instincts, and never use the family as interlopers in our disagreements or our secrets.  There was sadness that I could not share the everyday joy of motherhood with my parents and siblings.  Yet there was less pressure, no judgements haunting my decision making.  No unsolicited advice. Of course, no help either.  Every mistake was on us, as it should be. <em> (Pat- sorry I did not realize that you had chronic ear infections, with multiple perforations.

We did not park at the waiting room the morning they induced Rachel.  They had a plan; we respected it.

When Pat called to say Violet had arrived, I was shopping and Steve was on the golf course.  Steve promised to head home, and I told him to keep on golfing.  Their circle had expanded and their lives changed.   We wanted them to have time to clutch each other, celebrate the new contours of their family, and feel the pride they should have in creating a miracle.  I wanted Henry to meet his baby sister without extra eyes. Pat sent text updates so we could control our landing.

The thing I will always remember is the sisters-in-law hugging Rachel. Then the boys cooing and huddling together to examine the tiny little bundle, hugging Pat. Family. I would die for any of them.

We started the foundation of this family 33 years ago. By accident.  It wasn't the optimal time...job insecurity, law school unfinished, new house needing every repair. There is rarely a perfect time, and so on we went.  Pat's birth was spread on the airwaves, and he inherited an extended foster family of listeners. We added two more links, spent our youth shepherding them. We shifted every compass to the heading that would make their lives good lives. We never regretted what was left behind-freedom, money, peace of mind. The boys were our True North. They make us proud.

Then they added priceless links in my wonderful daughters-in-law.  Each child adds more depth and strength. They are our hopes.  They have exceeded our dreams.

Watching Steve hold Pat for the first time, I couldn't realize that he had just given me everything I could wish for. Now, when our family circles around to welcome the latest Dahl, I am far more clear: I have a Wonderful Life. Happy Birthday, Violet. Let's spend a bunch of them together.  All together.

The Joliat girls are extraordinary ironers.  It was an Irish/Catholic school/uniform blouse/child management legacy- who really knows? But as soon as we were tall enough to stand up to the ironing board- we ironed.

Our learner's permit was earned on hankies and pillow cases.  We set up the board in the dining room, where Mom could watch us.  Mom liked a neat linen closet, so we ironed sheets, too. (<em>All twin beds, YAY! It was the Lucy and Ricky era</em>)  Cotton goods were sprinkled, rolled and placed in a plastic bag with a zipper.

Then the countdown started.  It was an artificial deadline, to be sure, but the clothes had to be ironed before they mildewed.  The girls were the battle front.

I can still remember the shirt ironing lessons: Start with the back of collar,then front of collar from the points inward to avoid pleating.  Next shoulder plackets front, plackets back.  Sleeves, front and back, then cuffs, with care not to melt buttons or create folds.  Then, and last of all- the body of the shirt, from the right breast to the left.  Mom liked the pleats in back ironed down all the way.

Finished work was hung on the door jamb for inspection. One year Mom got a nifty attachment that allowed shirts to be cantilevered on an arm attached to the board. It bowed under the weight of the Joliat's clothes.

We never wore a shirt twice.  We were not going to be judged by dirty cuffs or food stained plackets.

Good God, there were shirts. Six kids, 5 uniform shirts or blouses daily.  Dad: 6 dress shirts weekly. Also a mountain of pants, sheets, skirts...and this started well before the perm press era.  God, how I loved perm press, despite an allergy to its active ingredient which made my legs and arms break out in little bumps.  And polyester was an Hallelujah moment for me.  Summer offered respite from the uniform stuff, and Dad wore short sleeves.  Mom added dusting and vacuuming as daily drudgery to keep us busy.

(can, maybe..do, unlikely)

In my adult life, I have avoided high-ironing garments, gravitating to T shirt material, jeans and jersey.  I logged too many hours. But I have respect for the process of taming something unruly, dominating disorder. I am always prepared to iron.

She does not shy from natural fibers, as I do. She has upgraded from dining room view to a TV view, and she probably multi-tasks by knocking off a TV show as she dominates unruly clothing. She has the German work ethic that I missed.

I gladly proffer the Ironing Queen crown to her. But...I have ironing tools at the ready: spray starch, good iron, hanger stack, cup for adding water, door jamb. I don't cotton to those racks for hanging the iron off the end. If you have a good cover, the iron can rest on it for a moment- it adds steam, and the hot resulting surface doubles the efficiency of the strokes.  The iron <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> be rested as you are shifting the garment, to avoid overheating and scorching. (See?  Mom was a great teacher)

I bought my ironing board in 1975, at an estate sale. I was moving out, and searching for household necessities.  It was really an ironing table, adjustable to various heights, perforated to enhance steam. I expect it had been in that household for a generation. I have a new respect for its faithful sturdiness.

I have ironed the wrinkles out of my kids' lives upon it.  I have spruced Steve up with it.  I taught the boys how to iron on it.

Last week, I plugged in the Rowenta and set it up, and the welds that hold the legs just broke away. It was the end of the road for my trusty board. I put my pile of wrinkledom in the linen closet, and started looking for a replacement.

To say <em>they don't make 'em like they used to</em> is a cliche, and it is also true. My search for Ironingboard.2 took me from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honey-Can-Do-BRD-01295-Full-Size-Ironing-Sturdy/dp/B001F51A3K/ref=lp_510246_1_9?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401555376&amp;sr=1-9">basics</a> to <a href="http://ironingboard.demachinor.com/iron-ease-ironing-board/">$150 tables</a> (Marie, you need this) that promise an euphoric experience.

Ah, I am a Joliat- I know there is no euphoria in ironing. But I also know, when life hands you wrinkles, you have to smooth them, dammit.

Old board went to the dump, and I bought a half assed replacement at Target. Ironing is out of favor in this era of $1.00 dry cleaning and steam contraptions.

(<em>People, do not EVER think that steaming brings the same crisp look to your garments. It is a lie.)</em>

I did not get a cover, which is necessary to trap steam. I consider this board a placeholder, unworthy but at the ready. It would topple over if I added any accessories, like a cord holder or hanger arm. It has been on its maiden ironing voyage.

I cannot control the universe, but I can create order, one shirt at a time. Perhaps I will upgrade someday.  Or get a cute teflon lined cover. (<em>Kids and Steve- this is not an item I want for Christmas, birthday, or ANY gifting occasion</em>) I just might haunt a few estate sales and see if I can locate an old school, height adjustable perforated table with a wide platform and sharp nose for those shoulders....

For the moment, however, I am pleased to be unrumpled.

The Joliat girls are extraordinary ironers.  It was an Irish/Catholic school/uniform blouse/child management legacy- who really knows? But as soon as we were tall enough to stand up to the ironing board- we ironed.

Our learner's permit was earned on hankies and pillow cases.  We set up the board in the dining room, where Mom could watch us.  Mom liked a neat linen closet, so we ironed sheets, too. (<em>All twin beds, YAY! It was the Lucy and Ricky era</em>)  Cotton goods were sprinkled, rolled and placed in a plastic bag with a zipper.

Then the countdown started.  It was an artificial deadline, to be sure, but the clothes had to be ironed before they mildewed.  The girls were the battle front.

I can still remember the shirt ironing lessons: Start with the back of collar,then front of collar from the points inward to avoid pleating.  Next shoulder plackets front, plackets back.  Sleeves, front and back, then cuffs, with care not to melt buttons or create folds.  Then, and last of all- the body of the shirt, from the right breast to the left.  Mom liked the pleats in back ironed down all the way.

Finished work was hung on the door jamb for inspection. One year Mom got a nifty attachment that allowed shirts to be cantilevered on an arm attached to the board. It bowed under the weight of the Joliat's clothes.

We never wore a shirt twice.  We were not going to be judged by dirty cuffs or food stained plackets.

Good God, there were shirts. Six kids, 5 uniform shirts or blouses daily.  Dad: 6 dress shirts weekly. Also a mountain of pants, sheets, skirts...and this started well before the perm press era.  God, how I loved perm press, despite an allergy to its active ingredient which made my legs and arms break out in little bumps.  And polyester was an Hallelujah moment for me.  Summer offered respite from the uniform stuff, and Dad wore short sleeves.  Mom added dusting and vacuuming as daily drudgery to keep us busy.

As kids, Jenny and I would bicker over who completed more items.  We knew it was wrong that the boys never did dishes or laundry or dusting or vacuuming, but we lacked the feminist gene.  I would have traded for their meager allotment of chores(garbage out on Thursday night, grass in the summer) in a nano second.  I wonder to this day if Mike or Paul can iron. (can, maybe..do, unlikely)

In my adult life, I have avoided high-ironing garments, gravitating to T shirt material, jeans and jersey.  I logged too many hours. But I have respect for the process of taming something unruly, dominating disorder. I am always prepared to iron.

My sister Marie has carried on the Joliat ultimate ironing tradition in her basement.  She lives in our childhood home....yeah, we Joliats cling to our past despite the elements of indentured servitude that I am highlighting in this post.   Must be something in the walls: she is a nurse, and despite the perm press nature of scrubs, she irons every single uniform, as well as every item she or her husband wears.

Pat, Rachel and Henry left the city in late September after selling their condo in a nano-second.  Their new house was a gut-rehab-add- a-second- story kind of project. It would require the entire fall and winter to complete. And the beginning of spring.  Their first accommodations were at the maternal in-laws, a charming vintage home with a basement dedicated to Henry, meals served morning and evening, fresh bread made daily, and a doting Gram and Grampa. Why would they leave?

But they did. Maybe Pat demanded equal time in his childhood room, and Rachel was powerless against his charms.

Steve was leaving for his sabbatical in Florida. I would be alone.  I'm sure Pat convinced her of my loneliness.(a figment of his imagination; I am not as pathetic as my kids believe.) Pat and Rachel had lived here when they returned from LA and I loved being needed again.

I was up for the adventure. I cleared closet space, emptied drawers, designated cupboards for peanut free food and melamine dinnerware and gave them their own bathroom. The circular drive was perfect for overnight parking, no car jockeying required. Little Henry and his folks swooped in mid-January with garbage bags full of  clothing and their life supporting stuff that was not in storage.

<img class="wp-image-2676 alignleft" alt="IMG_1006" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_1006-300x225.jpg" width="185" height="139" />Because the basement is Steve's broadcast HQ, the family room became the playroom.  A work bench, toys, a fleet of trucks, books, lawnmower, trains, cars, doctor kit, pirate gear- all the joys of a 2 year old took root. Step stools and floaty things migrated to the bathroom. The demographics of the home front plunged. Neatness counted less. The morning came earlier, the activity quotient expanded.

We jigsawed a normal existence for our new pod.  Rachel works a staggered schedule, and Pat's job demands crazy hours.  I functioned as command center,  occasional gap filler, Henry playmate. Pretty much all I had to do is be there and love Henry.  That is a job description I can happily adopt.

I tried to let them be a family, staying clear during the sweet morning time, and the chaotic dinner/bath/bed time.  Rachel is in her last trimester, (Baby girl, woo hoo) and between Work-Pat-Henry-Construction, she is overloaded. The winter made for terrible commutes and a housebound child, but I have to say, we got along famously. Which is not to say that they were not thrilled to see their new home ready for its new family.

Yesterday morning, Pat took Henry to his pre-school, and I knew he would be going to his forever home to nap. And stay.

I have to tell you, my heart broke.

It was so damn quiet.

Having Henry here took me back to a precious reality that I was too tired to embrace when I was chasing my own boys.  Kids wake up,too early but happy, calling for their lifelines. <em>Mommy, Daddy.</em> Their feet scamper faster than they should. They love their parents  purely, trust them to the edges of the world.  Every day Henry would stand in the bay window and watch Mommy and Daddy drive away.   He banged on the glass, waved and  sent them kisses, accompanied by a grunty hug, his arms crossed over his chest. They are his world, anyone else, a visitor. The seedlings of separation are planted, even at this early age, because he wants what he wants, and his parents are an obstacle to some of his goals. (Bed at midnight, chocolate milk, TV) He bargains, is hard to resist. He is a busy boy, not given to cuddling. He let me into his world to play fireman, and we climbed the attic stairs 50 times one afternoon to put out an imaginary fire. Milly became a Dalmatian. We saved kittens. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_0996.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2671" alt="IMG_0996" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_0996-225x300.jpg" width="144" height="192" /></a>

That was a great day.

There were about a hundred days like it, with thousands of moments.  Joy overflowed. Henry grew from being fearful of the dogs to knowing how to love them.  He got a fine shiner in a Super Bowl dance frenzy, and claimed he could sleep like a pirate, with one eye open and one eye shut. Yo ho, yo ho- a pirate's life for him. He learned to put his own coat and hat on, and is gravitating to big boy underpants.

<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2682 alignleft" alt="IMG_1019" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_1019-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2681 alignleft" alt="IMG_1016" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_1016-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />

He has memorized a zillion books, and will be able to read to his sister when she is old enough to sit up. He has built with Duplo blocks, created Valentines with glitter for the ones he loves, figured out how to open all the doors here to escape or free the dogs. He met the hamster next door and showed polite curiosity and not a bit of rodent fear. He learned to somersault and trampoline. His scooter skills, even on a bumpy brick driveway are daredevil-y. Praise God for his helmet.

This week we went to the park, a destination last visited in the Fall. Now the kid owns it.  Henry walked up the steepest slides, eschewed the bucket swing, teeter-tottered his brains out, scootered with abandon across the basketball courts, and introduced himself to big boys playing hockey. <em>My name is Henry, what's yours?</em> He found a fireman's pole tucked into the slide stairs, and leaped onto it. I caught him on the way to his second shiner in residence. He is exploring the world, fearlessly.  To see the exponential unfolding of my little man has been a gift to me.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_1007.jpg"> </a>

It is time for his life to go linear. Henry has moved 4 times in the last 8 months. He adapted beautifully and gracefully.  Quickly. He has never complained.  There are lessons there for me, and when I am not so ridiculously sad, I will access them and appreciate these months for the unexpected gifts that they brought me. I feel younger than I did in January.  My heart is fuller. I am grateful. Who would have thought this old dog would be shown new tricks?

Steve and I paid a visit to Henry late yesterday, to drop off his treasured trucks and his step stool. He has his own play room, and Gramma's messy family room is already in his rear view mirror. His big boy bed is nestled in the corner of his new airplane bedroom, sans box spring, so he can burrow in with his stuffed friends and his blankets. His face relaxes visibly when reminded he is in his forever home.

I have puttered here in a half hearted attempt to restore order. I peeled the Mickey Mouse stickers from his curtains. They were washed and rehung.  I moved the furniture so I wouldn't be shocked and sad at the emptiness when I glanced in. Order is over rated.

I cannot yet apply Windex to those greasy fingerprints in the bay window.  They say <em>I Love You, Mom and Dad. I cannot wait until you return</em>.  No parent or grandparent ever wants to erase that beautiful sentiment. And this particular Gramma will never forget being able to share it.

(Bed at midnight, chocolate milk, TV) He bargains, is hard to resist. He is a busy boy, not given to cuddling. He let me into his world to play fireman, and we climbed the attic stairs 50 times one afternoon to put out an imaginary fire. Milly became a Dalmatian. We saved kittens. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_0996.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-2671" alt="IMG_0996" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_0996-225x300.jpg" width="144" height="192" /></a>

That was a great day.

There were about a hundred days like it, with thousands of moments.  Joy overflowed. Henry grew from being fearful of the dogs to knowing how to love them.  He got a fine shiner in a Super Bowl dance frenzy, and claimed he could sleep like a pirate, with one eye open and one eye shut. Yo ho, yo ho- a pirate's life for him. He learned to put his own coat and hat on, and is gravitating to big boy underpants.

He has memorized a zillion books, and will be able to read to his sister when she is old enough to sit up. He has built with Duplo blocks, created Valentines with glitter for the ones he loves, figured out how to open all the doors here to escape or free the dogs. He met the hamster next door and showed polite curiosity and not a bit of rodent fear. He learned to somersault and trampoline. His scooter skills, even on a bumpy brick driveway are daredevil-y. Praise God for his helmet.

This week we went to the park, a destination last visited in the Fall. Now the kid owns it.  Henry walked up the steepest slides, eschewed the bucket swing, teeter-tottered his brains out, scootered with abandon across the basketball courts, and introduced himself to big boys playing hockey. <em>My name is Henry, what's yours?</em> He found a fireman's pole tucked into the slide stairs, and leaped onto it. I caught him on the way to his second shiner in residence. He is exploring the world, fearlessly.  To see the exponential unfolding of my little man has been a gift to me.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/05/IMG_1007.jpg"> </a>

It is time for his life to go linear. Henry has moved 4 times in the last 8 months. He adapted beautifully and gracefully.  Quickly. He has never complained.  There are lessons there for me, and when I am not so ridiculously sad, I will access them and appreciate these months for the unexpected gifts that they brought me. I feel younger than I did in January.  My heart is fuller. I am grateful. Who would have thought this old dog would be shown new tricks?

Steve and I paid a visit to Henry late yesterday, to drop off his treasured trucks and his step stool. He has his own play room, and Gramma's messy family room is already in his rear view mirror. His big boy bed is nestled in the corner of his new airplane bedroom, sans box spring, so he can burrow in with his stuffed friends and his blankets. His face relaxes visibly when reminded he is in his forever home.

I have puttered here in a half hearted attempt to restore order. I peeled the Mickey Mouse stickers from his curtains. They were washed and rehung.  I moved the furniture so I wouldn't be shocked and sad at the emptiness when I glanced in. Order is over rated.

I cannot yet apply Windex to those greasy fingerprints in the bay window.  They say <em>I Love You, Mom and Dad. I cannot wait until you return</em>.  No parent or grandparent ever wants to erase that beautiful sentiment. And this particular Gramma will never forget being able to share it.

Now she was co-Mom.[/caption]

This weekend my sister Jennifer celebrates a birthday.  I wish I was in her zip code so I could celebrate this milestone. This birthday will make her eligible for social security, and so in the weeks to come, she will also be stepping away from a teaching career that she has loved. These rites of passage will unquestionably result in torrents of tears from my sister,  as soft hearted and iron willed a woman as I have ever met. I am determined to mark the retirement/birthday tandem over the summer, but today I just wanted to send her a bouquet of appreciation.

Though we are from a family of 6, we were clumped in duos. Jenny and I were a pair.  I ended her solitary reign as princess just 17 months after her birth, and she accepted the diminished attention with grace and kindness.  Little did she know that from that day forward, she would be the Little Mother to all who came after. Never again would she sleep alone. We were folding diapers at age six, ironing at 8.  She was stuck babysitting for a tribe until she was in high school. Worse, she was stuck with me.

Jenny escaped her crib at 18 months with a rotating airplane move, and I have no doubt that she did it to check on her new baby sister. I was a burden, subject to bad dreams, wild imaginative journeys, and tons of crying.  I'm sure she was thrilled when Mike came along 16 months after I did, because he was congenial and a novelty as a boy.  She taught me to help take care of him; in fact he went to kindergarten never uttering a word, because Jenny and I would follow him around and anticipate his needs.

She stole every boy I brought home, and I couldn't blame them.[/caption]

Jenny was always a nurturer. I hated school, she loved it. If I had a nun-driven panic attack, she would calm me.  When I went to camp and suffered miserable homesickness, she would prop me up.  When I has an asthma attack at the same camp, she visited me in the infirmary, and wangled a call home from the nurse.  I ordered my parents to come and get me.  They ordered Jennifer to make sure I buckled down and stayed. I stayed.

We shared a small bedroom in Royal Oak, Michigan,  the only one that accommodated twin (not bunk) beds. We had our worst fights there. I was a slob, she was pristine.  I could sleep in the light and she needed dark. I liked noise, she needed quiet.  My clothes sometimes tiptoed to her side of the closet. Sometimes I did not lower my assigned window shade. We would explode in pushing matches and word blasts. Mom and Dad would intervene, threaten us, and it was over.  She would turn on her bonnet hair dryer to muffle my noise and stew; I would fall asleep within moments.   She was  a softie, and I was careless with hateful words. She should have shuffled me out of her life.  She did not.

I remained a loner/homebody during high school. I was content: I had a boyfriend, a big family, and I had a best friend in Jenny.   We shared late night drive-bys of the boyfriends' houses.  I watched her practice smoking and declared it gross, but I never tattled. As soft as she looked, she had a strand of daredevil in her, and I marveled at all the adventures she took on.  Not me.  She failed to convert me to <strong>cool kid</strong>, and I remained an outsider nerd,  while she had a cabal of friends.  She still has these high school friends in her life.

When she left for college, I was on my own.  A year behind her, I had decided to stay home for college or go to Eastern Michigan University, the closest state school.  When my advisor told me that was a bad fit, I decided to bootstrap off Jennifer (again) and join her at Central Michigan University.  I hated it.  She consoled me, visited me, let me live down the hall in Woldt Hall.   She included me in her Friday sub orders, sun lamp adventures, dining table and extracurriculars. Her college friends were kind to me. I settled in.

Since that time, we have been separated by our geography, but never our hearts. We both married men who loved their alcohol.  We commiserated and counseled each other.  She eventually had to step out of the mayhem, returning for her Master's in education while teaching preschool.  There was fear in her life, and finally, I could be a rock for her.  She gave her husband a second chance. When that was a FAIL, she left a beautiful estate home for a doll house that Mom and I scouted with her. Her first night there, she slept better than she had in 5 years. She lives there still. In peace. Her circle of high school/college/professional/neighborhood friends is ever-present in her home.  She's magnetic.

<p style="text-align: center;">We still fight now and then, and I have said harsh things, which roll off her back. She feels comfortable ignoring my advice about remarriage and such, because she knows I will love her unconditionally no matter what roads she travels.  I owe her. She still knits me into her gigantic circle of friends, letting me tag along (again/still) when she travels to Europe with  her rat pack. They love her so much that they welcome not only me, but my friends.  She has built a hive, and all kinds of people fly in and out to share her. I am lucky enough to have the longest continuous relationship of my life with her. It's like I have dibbies.</p>
For the last many years, she has been a master teacher, working a two year loop of Kindergarten-first grade at<a href="https://vimeo.com/33610407"> Pembroke Elementary in Birmingham, Michigan.</a> (Yep, that movie stars Jenny, in front of one of her frilly bulletin boards. She looks tired.  She IS tired. ) She is the teacher that we all dream of, living four blocks from her school so that she can return and work into the night.  She meets her kids over the summer at the playground.  They love her animated, kid centric world.  She has survived eight rounds of school "reform" yet still does essentially the exact same thing she did when she started:  she figures out where her kids are in September, and drags them to where they need to be by second grade. She loves them, loves their families, and loves her colleagues. School is her second home. She has adopted bunnies, chicks, guinea pigs and hamsters, sometimes all at once. One visit to her home jangled me, because all her rodents danced through the night, as befits their nocturnal nature.  Their cages were lined outside my bedroom, and I fully expected company. Jenny apparently has learned to sleep with a modicum of noise.

A couple of Jenny anecdotes:   One August she sent her students a <strong>Welcome to School</strong> postcard bearing her bunny's face with the message that Fluffy was excited to see them. But Fluffy croaked before the first day of school.  Jen wouldn't go with a doppleganger bunny, so September launched with a memorial service. In Spring, Mrs. Deckrow took the kids to the farm and they decided to hatch little duckings for the spring.  You know all those cute books with downy baby ducks?  That was the goal. When their eggs hatched, there were ugly, scrawny brown birds of some sort.  Scary at first glance.  Those kids learned a few ancillary lessons when their expectations were confounded.  They still loved those hatchlings, and they said sweet goodbyes to their bunny.  Jenny is proof positive that you <a href="http://www.scrapbook.com/poems/doc/842.html">learn everything important in Kindergarten</a>. With reading, math and a million other things piled on top. She has outlasted four principals and almost every other staff member at Pembroke. She knows she makes a difference.

Hundreds of parents will be heartbroken that their children will not benefit from her calm, wise teaching. It is time, though.  The desks are too low,  her back is sore. Her pay has been frozen for the last bunch of years, and her insurance costs have risen: Michigan wants their teachers young and cheap. Their pension is a defined contribution plan, and when linked with her social security, she will have security. After a life of deferred vacations, summer tutoring, continuing education, seminars and such- she is going to have time off. No clock alarm in September.  I will distract her by spiriting her to Lake Michigan. She can take time for herself.

Of course, she never does anything just for herself.  She teaches Catechism, makes layettes for babies born into bad circumstances, answers anyone's call for help, serves Communion on Sundays, helps with her 10 (almost) grandchildren, works a soup kitchen if needed. Loves her girlfriends, loves meeting them for any reason or no reason. She has ants in her pants. When I stayed with her last weekend, she had her flower boxes full of pansies, for God's sake. She does more in a day than I do  in a week.  It is Steve's intention to marry her if I pre-decease him, and I approve. A few dominoes are all that stands between Steve and his Joliat sister fantasy. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/04/unnamed-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2648" alt="unnamed-1" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/04/unnamed-11-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

I joke.  But not about my sister.  She is the best gift my parents gave me, steady and loving, generous and sunny. Happy Birthday, Jennifer.

I hope everyone reading here has a Jennifer. And I hope you let them know that they mean the world to you.

Loves her girlfriends, loves meeting them for any reason or no reason. She has ants in her pants. When I stayed with her last weekend, she had her flower boxes full of pansies, for God's sake. She does more in a day than I do  in a week.  It is Steve's intention to marry her if I pre-decease him, and I approve. A few dominoes are all that stands between Steve and his Joliat sister fantasy. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/04/unnamed-11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2648" alt="unnamed-1" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/janet-dahl-et-al/files/2014/04/unnamed-11-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>

I joke.  But not about my sister.  She is the best gift my parents gave me, steady and loving, generous and sunny. Happy Birthday, Jennifer.

I hope everyone reading here has a Jennifer. And I hope you let them know that they mean the world to you.

DO come back, please. I have a million stories. Some are even about the world at large, not my family.

I guess if we can live separately for three months, a day of additional separation is nothing.

Our first adventure was a blowout courtesy of some metal road debris.  Judy was driving, and my niece Emma directed us to pull over. The pilot had nerves of steel: I would have rolled into a ditch to be far from traffic.  I commandeered a tow truck to save us with the AAA membership  that my hub gifts the family for Christmas every year.  It was 10:30pm, pitch dark, on a detour route just as 696 closed altogether.  I was not about to deal with the tire, despite the fact that my dad made me change a tire before I got my license. That was the stone age, I was sure things had changed. (They had not) We pulled out the piles of reception vases we were hauling, our gifts, our suitcases and waited. Our dispatcher was calming, and he gave us a 90 minute window. The tow truck came on the scene in ten minutes. The spare was good, I used my phone as a flashlight (<em>really, no spot or flashlight, Mr. tow truck driver?</em>) and we were off. Jenny awaited us in Birmingham, Michigan. Bailey's and cream was called for. Make mine a double. Then bed.

They say you can't go home, and that is a lie.  I love going home, swimming in memories of my childhood. I miss being enmeshed with my siblings.  I will never live in the Detroit area again, but I will always feel connected to- and formatted by my time in Royal Oak. I kept pointing out places to Emma: the car wash Mom went to every Friday after her hair appointment, the school I taught at, the Taco Bell where Steve and I would buy beans and 17cent tacos when we were broke. The field we played baseball on, the firehouse I delivered my brother's news route to, the barber shop where Mom convinced me Chet could cut me a gorgeous pixie cut. (C<em>het's Hack-o-rama was what we called the place...even my Dad would not go there</em>) Emma was not particularly impressed by the Tour of Janet World.  She did perk up when I told her that her Mom ditched grade school and took a bus to Northwood Shopping Center so she could have french fries and a Coke at Woolworth's.  Judy may have wanted the cone of silence on that one.

My youngest sister lives in my childhood home, and she is in the process of redecorating the living room that we were never allowed to be in unless Dad had a fresh reel of home movies, or Ed Sullivan had an epic guest.  In those cases Dad put up the foldaway screen, or rolled the TV down the hall from the den. Mom made fudge. Other than those rare evenings, the living room was an Early American museum, available to adults or upon holidays. Mom was saving it for God knows what, since no adult in his right mind would want to drop in on a family of six kids. We did have the rare Fuller Brush salesman displaying his wares on the good sofa...but really, who keeps a room unused for a backdrop for house cleaning supplies?

Marie followed Mom's habit of using only the den, but now she will de-formalize her space to accommodate the broadening of her family via marriage.  The prospective son in law is an athlete;  his athlete's body will push the den beyond cozy to claustrophobic.  We spitballed floorplans and media placement and laughed at our inability to conjure up a casual furniture arrangement for the Forbidden Space.  Mom programmed us to view the living room as sacred. Marie is on her own.

The two days there was a clot of visiting, shopping,  eating, celebrating, tire replacing, blabbing and meeting new babies.(<em>Welcome great niece Violet, 6 weeks, and great nephew, Brody 3 weeks</em> ) Sleep was an interruption, and only available in 5 hour clumps. Sunday came too soon, and I surprised my family and my self by observing Good Friday abstinence and attending Easter Sunday services. Monsignor John Zenz said a lovely Mass at <a href="http://hnchurch.org/">Holy Name.</a> He read the Gospel where Peter and the disciples run to the tomb to find Jesus gone. They ran home, to be embraced and comforted by their families. Then their lives resumed.  They could not stand still.  Via the "running" imagery, he recalled the devastation in Boston last year, and the determination of the runners and supporters to go forward. ( "<em>They said life would never be the same, and yet, tomorrow almost 40,000 will run on Patriot's Day. Life goes forward. We join it.")</em>

<em></em>He reminded the congregation that daily life throws tremendous obstacles at almost every person, and there is nobility in pushing to finish the marathon.  He specializes in crises, of course. He mentioned ill people he had anointed at nursing homes,  a funeral Mass for a young man with muscular dystrophy which  featured a procession by Paralympic friends, and a catechism class he observed for the residents of <a href="www.angelsplace.com/our-story/">Angels' Place,</a> a group home for special needs men. ( <em>My cousin lives there</em>)    All in a week's work.  He draws strength and comfort from community, and shares it with this warm and welcoming parish. They are there for each other.

I miss being connected to a faith community; I miss my family. I can work harder on both platforms.

I felt  communal rebar this weekend with my siblings, and I felt it in that church. This comforted me, because life keeps moving on, and it rarely gets easier along the way. I have had the blessing of parents who were there to lift me, and keep me on the path. I am close to all my brothers and sisters.  My husband has propped me up when my parents died, and has steered me through hard times. My kids are a great third act, complete with grandkids to carry on when I am gone.  I have great company on my marathon, girlfriends who are co-experiencing both joys and cruelties of life, and who guide and console.

This weekend brought me so many moments,  so many memories.

And at least one resolution.

From now on, Mabel and Milly are welcome in the living room.

They are at least at the Fuller Brush Man level.

Amen.
