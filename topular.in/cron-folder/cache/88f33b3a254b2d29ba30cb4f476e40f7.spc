Picking a theme was easy: travel. Both my husband and I love to travel, and it’s a passion we hope Mila will one day share. For color, I wanted something clean and simple; I ultimately settled on grays, white, and just a bit of pink.

Like many Chicago apartments, our space is small, so I went with a classic and space saving crib from Natart (coincidentally called the Barcelona). Above it, my sweet and accommodating husband, with only a few choice words during the process, applied the large map decal. The Japanese crane origami mobile is from one of my favorite Chicago baby boutiques, Twinkle Twinkle Little One. The fan is a keepsake from a trip to Japan, and the flute (at the base of the fan) was a gift from a friend who lives in India.

We’re certainly not the first to use the Ikea Hemnes dresser as a changing table, but I’m particularly proud of our little Ikea hack. I’ve had the dresser, which was originally a light wood color, for 10 years. When it came time to put together the nursery, we (and by we, I mean my husband) painted it white, swapped out the knobs for the circle pulls, and threw a changing table on top of it.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chewables-chicago/files/2015/01/IMG_4724-e1421016121945.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1756 aligncenter" alt="Nursery Glider" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chewables-chicago/files/2015/01/IMG_4724-e1421016121945.jpg" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>
The top picture over the dresser was used at Mila's baby shower. It was such a special day, and I wanted to make sure to include a keepsake of it in her nursery. The owl was custom made for the nursery by Horrible Adorables, who I met at this summer’s Renegade Craft Festival. The three remaining prints over the dresser all fit with the travel theme, including the one on the left that says, “Not all who wander are lost.” These are from MKKM Designs. And the photograph above the glider of the Eiffel tower with pink springtime blooms is from one of my favorite photographers, Rebecca Plotnick.

It’s still a work in progress. I need to put up pictures of Mila’s two great grandmothers, who we named her after. I may also add a white rug. In the meantime, though, we’re enjoying the space. Especially when Mila decides to sleep in her crib for long, uninterrupted periods of time!

This made pregnancy sans wine rather challenging. My husband, knowing how much I missed wine, came up with a plan to lessen the blow: each month he surprised me with a different, very nice (it helped that our normal alcohol expenses had drastically decreased) bottle of wine that we could share post baby girl's arrival. And he marked each bottle with the month received so we could remember when it was from.

Isn’t he the sweetest?

His goal was to pick out bottles he thought I would like and also that had some significance to us. We found out we were pregnant while visiting Argentina, so the first, the Luigi Bosca Malbec, is an Argentine specialty (and one of my longtime favorite bodegas). He knows I love port in the winter, so he made sure to include the Niepport in the bunch. The Toscano represented our first trip together when we went to Tuscany. And there are several champagnes, since I particularly craved the bubbly while pregnant. He actually gave me the last champagne the morning our daughter was born – she arrived exactly at 40 weeks – right before we left for the hospital.

Below is the full list of wines from my husband. Hardest decision is where to begin. Oh, and if your wife (significant partner/finance/girlfriend/etc…) is pregnant, I highly recommend this!

But when Mila was born, it became clear that it was time to look into some new (for me) apps – her grandparents demanded photos! They’re all easy to use/available from my iPhone, and not because I think iPhone is best (actually, I kind of hate it as a phone), but because it’s what I have:

<b>iCloud Photo Stream</b> – I realize I am late to the party (is the party still even going on?), but I love that I can store (as backup) all the photos I am obsessively taking of my daughter <i>and </i>invite a limited number of people – close family and friends who actually want to see all the photos I’m taking – to see them. This way I also avoid broadcasting all her photos on Facebook/other more public social media sites, which I did not want to do. Added bonus: extra storage on iCloud is ridiculously cheap.

<b>FaceTime</b> – Okay, I am even later to this party, but having FaceTime when grandparents are out of town is pretty much the best thing ever. They love seeing her real time, and she will love it too one day. Case in point: I have a friend whose two year old’s nightly routine includes a call to her out of town grandparents. She can even do it by herself now while her parents clean up/take care of other things around the house.

<b>Baby Connect – </b>During these first few months, the doctor has had us tracking all feedings and diaper changes (prompting more discussions about poopy and pee pee than I ever thought I would have in my life). This little app is amazing. It’s super easy to log everything, not just feedings and diaper changes, but size and weight, vaccination records, milestones, etc… And you can have multiple users inputting from their own phones, and the information will sync. The app costs $4.99 and is worth every penny.

<b>Sound Sleeper</b> – Apparently some babies fall asleep to different kinds of white noise like magic. That is not my kid (the sleep sheep, loved by so many, seems to have no effect whatsoever on Mila). But I’ve heard some of the white noise apps are good, and this one has several sounds to choose from, including a shhh and womb sound. I’m still deciding how well this works for us, but the app itself has been simple to use.

Parents: what apps have you loved? Any other technology tidbits? I’m open to trying most things, especially if it makes her sleep longer at night!

But when Mila was born, it became clear that it was time to look into some new (for me) apps – her grandparents demanded photos! They’re all easy to use/available from my iPhone, and not because I think iPhone is best (actually, I kind of hate it as a phone), but because it’s what I have:

<b>iCloud Photo Stream</b> – I realize I am late to the party (is the party still even going on?), but I love that I can store (as backup) all the photos I am obsessively taking of my daughter <i>and </i>invite a limited number of people – close family and friends who actually want to see all the photos I’m taking – to see them. This way I also avoid broadcasting all her photos on Facebook/other more public social media sites, which I did not want to do. Added bonus: extra storage on iCloud is ridiculously cheap.

<b>FaceTime</b> – Okay, I am even later to this party, but having FaceTime when grandparents are out of town is pretty much the best thing ever. They love seeing her real time, and she will love it too one day. Case in point: I have a friend whose two year old’s nightly routine includes a call to her out of town grandparents. She can even do it by herself now while her parents clean up/take care of other things around the house.

<b>Baby Connect – </b>During these first few months, the doctor has had us tracking all feedings and diaper changes (prompting more discussions about poopy and pee pee than I ever thought I would have in my life). This little app is amazing. It’s super easy to log everything, not just feedings and diaper changes, but size and weight, vaccination records, milestones, etc… And you can have multiple users inputting from their own phones, and the information will sync. The app costs $4.99 and is worth every penny.

<b>Sound Sleeper</b> – Apparently some babies fall asleep to different kinds of white noise like magic. That is not my kid (the sleep sheep, loved by so many, seems to have no effect whatsoever on Mila). But I’ve heard some of the white noise apps are good, and this one has several sounds to choose from, including a shhh and womb sound. I’m still deciding how well this works for us, but the app itself has been simple to use.

I ran regularly and consistently hit my 10,000 daily steps. I practiced yoga at least twice a week. I had started taking Pilates again.

After seeing those two positive lines on the pregnancy test (and after celebrating with my husband), I committed myself to a fit pregnancy. The potential health benefits – an easier pregnancy, delivery, and recovery – and the positive mental juices I always get from a workout made continuing to exercise a no-brainer for me. Plus, I assumed that, with only minor modifications, I could just maintain my current fitness routine. After all, I had heard stories about women running six miles right before going into labor. I figured, sure, why not?

I discovered why not just a few days after learning I was pregnant, when 1<sup>st</sup> trimester exhaustion, nausea, and food aversions <del datetime="2014-11-20T23:15:23+00:00">sucker punched me</del> set in. I could barely get off the couch, let alone get to the gym. By the time I made it through 1<sup>st</sup> trimester and felt well enough to work out, I was far from my pre-pregnancy stellar shape. I had lost endurance, muscle tone, and weight. I was weak.

Restarting a fitness routine after an extended break is always hard. Restarting when pregnant was, for me, a major reality check (as was my ever-expanding waistline). I had no choice but to recalibrate my expectations of what a fit pregnancy would look like. It was not going to be business as usual with some minor modifications, but rather a new way of exercising and thinking about exercising. Here’s ultimately worked for me*:

<b>Run, run-walk, walk-run, walk (and crawl):</b> Once I peeled myself off the couch, I began running again. No speed records were set (which is saying a lot, since I am notoriously slow), but I was out there running. After a while, I needed to add some walking breaks into my runs. And that walking time became longer and longer, to the point where I was walking with an occasional few minutes of running. In 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester, I switched entirely from running to long walks, and as those became harder, I aimed for several shorter walks a day rather than a single long one. By the last few weeks of pregnancy, making it two blocks (which was more of a crawl than anything else) was a challenge. Still, I did it (all while cursing those women who ran 6 miles the day they gave birth).

<b>Try out prenatal Pilates/yoga: </b>I was religious about taking prenatal Pilates and yoga classes. Yes, the cost of classes adds up, but the hubby and I figured we were saving so much money in wine and dinners out, that it was a wash. More importantly, I felt infinitely better when I took the classes. I tried several options, and settled on two standouts: the prenatal Pilates classes at <a href="http://www.coreconceptschicago.com" target="_blank">Core Concepts</a> on Belmont, where we had a regular group of expectant mamas and two amazing teachers, and the prenatal yoga classes at <a href="http://sweetpeasstudio.com" target="_blank">Sweet Pea's Studio</a>, which were part yoga and part group therapy.

<b>Strength train arms, butt, and legs: </b>I was not broken, just pregnant, so I continued non-core strength training. This was important not only for once the baby was born (tiny humans are heavy!) but also for delivery, which, along with running a marathon, was <i>the</i> most physically intense thing I’ve ever done. Beyond the strength training in Pilates and yoga, I did squats every day and TRX work outs until I was 36 weeks pregnant.

<b>Remember, you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> eating for two: </b>Public service announcement - you are eating for one plus a peanut. As such, pregnancy is not a free pass to eat whatever you want/twice as much as you need. In fact, most pregnant women only need 300 more calories each day than they did when not pregnant. That is not a lot. Did I indulge in a few extra sweets now and then? Absolutely. Especially at the end when pregnancy was particularly uncomfortable and ridiculous (how is it humanly possible to get that big?). But I did not make a habit of it.

<b>Enlist your partner/friends:</b> My husband and friends regularly <del datetime="2014-11-20T23:15:23+00:00">walked me</del> joined me on my runs and walks. And I took Pilates with a great group of expectant women who were also dedicated to having healthy pregnancies and who I looked forward to seeing at each class. Knowing others supported my fit pregnancy goal was crucial, not to mention it made exercising a lot more fun.

*Before starting any exercise routine, speak with your doctor/midwife/etc… about what is right for you.

This past week the two teamed up for a special Mediterranean cooking class at Chopping Block’s Merchandise Mart location, all proceeds going to Common Threads, with the enthusiastic and knowledgeable Chef Jeff Adamek as instructor.

In its cooking classes, Common Threads not only teaches cooking skills, but also how to make healthy choices through a variety of cuisines. Our Chopping Block lesson mirrored those objectives with a Mediterranean cooking class – with its focus on lean meats and seafood, vegetables, legumes, and heart healthy oils – Mediterranean can be one of the healthiest cuisines.

Chef Jeff guided us as we made baked pita chips and humus, falafel (not fried!) and tahini sauce, couscous salad with fresh grilled vegetables, and rose water scented yogurt berry parfaits. And while we all went home with the recipes, my favorite part was the editorial tips Chef Jeff provided along the way, like:
<ul>
	<li>You know Stacy’s pita chips? The ones you buy for $3-$4 a bag? They are ridiculously easy to make at home, at a fraction of the price. Here’s what you do (okay, this one is kind of a recipe): take a whole pita bread, lay it flat on the counter, and, with a serrated knife parallel to the counter, slice the outside ½ inch perimeter until you have two circular halves. Cut both in half so you have half moons.

[caption id="attachment_1688" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chewables-chicago/files/2014/05/IMG_3520-e1400849015180.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1688 " alt="Homemade (and cheaper!) pita chips" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chewables-chicago/files/2014/05/IMG_3520-e1400849015180.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a> Homemade (and cheaper!) pita chips[/caption]

Lay one on top of the other and cut each in half and then in half again. You’ll have something that looks very much like pita chips. Then, on a cooking sheet, toss the pita in olive or grape seed oil and sprinkle with smoky paprika and sumac (my new favorite spice, I need to get some of that!). Throw it in the oven at 375 for about 10 minutes, and you have your next party appetizer. For cheap.</li>
	<li>Speaking of oil, Chef Jeff made us a garlic infused grape seed oil that we used for pretty much everything by carefully simmering whole garlic cloves in grape seed oil prior to class. While the notion of heating up a pot of oil sort of terrifies me (speak to my mother – at 14 this was the cause of a not-too-little kitchen fire), the result makes it totally worth it.</li>
	<li>And just one more point about oil. Chef Jeff suggests using olive or grape seed oil for pretty much everything (even baking). I’ve always used olive or canola oils, but after this class think I need to add some of that grape seed oil, with its high smoke point, light taste, and high (heart healthy) polyunsaturated fat content, into the mix.</li>
	<li>The secret ingredient for hummus? Water. Somewhat counter intuitively, it adds a smoothness to hummus that just adding more oil does not.</li>
	<li>I have long made couscous in the microwave, but at Chopping Block we mixed boiling water into a bowl of dry couscous. This is particularly helpful to me because, on a <del datetime="2014-05-23T12:34:42+00:00">tmi</del> personal note, my microwave is currently bust (I swear we’re going to get it fixed/get a new one, as soon as we can find the time….).</li>
	<li>Instead of deep-frying the falafel, we kept the dish healthy by cooking it on a griddle (you can also use the oven) with a bit of chickpea flour dusted on the outsides to get a nice golden sear. Didn’t miss the frying at all.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Have you ever heard of vanilla paste? It’s made of vanilla beans infused into a syrup, and has a richer, fuller flavor – and those great vanilla bean specs – than vanilla extra, which is made by macerating vanilla beans with alcohol, often bourbon. Chef Jeff says you can swap paste for extract in any recipe.</li>

I'm not sure about you, but I've heard over and over that Au Cheval's matzah ball soup is the stuff of legends. And being the nice Jewish girl that I am, I was eager to give it a try. The soup arrived beautifully presented, a massive matzah ball topped with a broth soaked pearl onion all placed ceremoniously in a shallow pool of soup. But I have to admit: Grandma's is better. The matzah ball is just a little too dense, the broth a little too rich, the herbs a little too strong. Good, yes. The best? No. I'm afraid (or perhaps relieved?) that title belongs with Grandma.

Tickets are $95, and right now there is still space available. You can register <a href="http://atyourschool.youritdept.com/tcb/jsp/ViewEvent.jsp?CALTYPE=M&amp;eventId=157625&amp;SESSIONID=1398785928518" target="_blank">here</a>.

Hope to see you there!

It’s winter. And post holiday winter at that. The glitz and glitter of December have lost their shine, and there’s basically nothing to look forward to until about April (not to be dramatic about it). Here in Chicago it is frigid, dark, and snowy.

The fight is on: winter doldrums versus us. The faint of heart need not apply. But since we have no choice, some survival tips that at least yours truly will be attempting to implement these next few months:

1. <strong>Start a new show</strong>. And by “new” I mean catch up on one of those shows that everyone has been talking about but you still haven’t watched. During this time of the year, getting into a show with the instant gratification of constant unseen episodes is, well, good for the soul. On New Year’s Day, the hubby and I joined the world of the living and started Homeland. That stuff is A.MAZE.ING. I’m too embarrassed to admit how many episodes we’re now in….

2. Speaking of escapist pursuits, <strong>plan a vacation</strong>. Or, better yet, go on one. Few times of the year scream <em>leave Chicago!</em> like January or February (or March, the evil tease of the bunch). No matter where you go, you’re pretty much guaranteed to have warmer weather than here.

3. <strong>Work out</strong>. Not only will it make you feel better (get those endorphins going, yeah!), but it will help you work off that extra weight you know you put on over the holidays. This works whether you’re admitting to making a diet-related New Year’s resolution or not.

4. <strong>Drink</strong>. Yes, that’s right, I am advocating a little bit of the sauce to help grease away those winter blahs. As I’ve mentioned previously, this winter the hubby and I are diving into some good port. (Goes great with Homeland, by the way). Added benefit: new port glasses we received over the holidays (thanks Mom!).

5. Start <strong>planning</strong> how you’re going to tackle all those lofty <strong>2014 goals</strong> you set. Now’s the time, and there are no more excuses. It is not still the holidays. And your New Year’s hangover is gone (I sincerely hope, at least). This is when the hard work comes in. Figure out how you’re going to get it done and do it.
