Capping off a week that saw the geniuses at the internet's busiest Bulls message board start a petition to fire Gar Forman while the overwhelming majority of fans and wanna-be media members (you know them as "Bulls Bloggers") were losing their minds because the team didn't trade Gasol and Snell for McLemore and Koufas, the Bulls won their third straight game.

And they did it without Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose, and Nikola Mirotic (not to mention Joakim Noah, who is out for the year). They did it against a Wizards team that had won three of their last four games and were the only team in the Association with a better record on the road than at home.

They did it without their 1st, 3rd and 4th leading scorer. With Pau Gasol questionable because of the flu. With Mike Dunleavy just starting to get into game shape. They did it with E'Twaun Moore starting at PG and Tony Snell starting at SG. With Doug McDermott closing out the game at SG. With Cristiano playing over 12 minutes.

I'm assuming this isn't the only Bulls blog you read, so you're familiar with these guys (according to approximately 93% of Bulls fans and 91% of Bulls bloggers):

Gasol, who is over the hill and should have been traded for a bucket of KFC, had 10 points, 15 rebounds and 9 assists in just under 32 minutes.

Dunleavy, who was far too old to give a 3-year deal last summer, had 14 points on 6/9 shooting while finishing the game guarding Bradley Beal.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/bullsville/files/2016/02/Moore.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2338" alt="Moore" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/bullsville/files/2016/02/Moore-300x217.jpg" width="300" height="217" /></a>

Moore, who just simply can't handle playing PG, had 17 points in 29:09 on the floor, with 28 of those minutes at PG. He scored six of the Bulls final eight points in crunch time and combined with McDermott to score 18 of the Bulls 20 points in the final 12 minutes.

Yes, that McDermott. The huge bust who can do nothing but shoot 3's because he is so unathletic had a highlight reel dunk off a beautiful baseline drive. He hit a pair of amazing fade-away jumpers to beat the shot clock. He hit runners and floaters. He scored 12 of the Bulls final 24 points, including 10 in the 4th quarter on 4/5 shooting when the Bulls were struggling to score and hold off a final Washington comeback. He now has 60 points in his last three games, seeming to finally find the confidence that Thibs completely killed last season.

Snell, the dude who has no business being in the league at all, was aggressive all night, finishing with 16 points, four rebounds and three assists in a team-high 33:38 of playing time. He hit 6/11 overall and 4/5 from behind the arc, and was a big part of holding Bradley Beal to 7/19 shooting on the night.

Gibson had quite possibly the ugliest 17 point (6/10 FG), 7 rebound, career-high 7 assist game I have ever seen.

But it wasn't nearly as bad as Brooks, the 7th Bull in double figures with 11 points in just under 20 minutes. But it took him 15 shots (five makes) to get there, he was 0/5 on 3-pointers, and I'd say his defense was even worse than usual if that were possible.

Felicio, who of course was just a waste of a roster spot that was preventing the team from filling its gaping hole at SF all season, again looked good in his 12+ minutes on the floor. He had bulk but quickness to go with it, he's tough, and he's got some skills and shooting touch as well. If his first couple of games in which he's actually played are even a small indication, I'm thinking this guy can be the 4th big on a pretty damn good team once he gets some experience.

But back to McDermott - in his last six games:

15.7 pts
.576 fg
.458 3pt

Aaron Brooks was the one Bull who couldn't make a shot, going 1/6 from the field and 0/3 from behind the arc, but he did have a game-high 9 assists in just over 17 minutes on the court.

It's hard to say whose offensive performance was more impressive - Rose backed up his scoring with seven rebounds and six assists, and he did it all in only 30:49 on the floor. Moore had 15 points (6/6 FG, 3/3 3's) in the 3rd quarter alone, including 13 during a 31- 15 Bulls run over the final 9:30 that was the difference in the game.

Dunleavy finally looked like the MDJ of old, after scoring only 25 points total in his first five games after returning from back surgery. If he can continue to knock down open 3's (he's now shooting .538 from behind the arc) and play good team defense once Jimmy Butler returns from his knee injury, it will go a long way toward helping this team fill the gaping SF hole it has struggled to fill all season.

That, however, is also highly dependent on McDermott being an offensive weapon off the bench, and it was certainly encouraging to see him be just that for the second consecutive game. His 16 points came on the back of the impressive 30 he put up against the Raptors, and he did it on a variety of shots including a nice left-handed finish in traffic and a very Dirk-like extreme fall-away jumper with the shot clock about to expire.

Having Dunleavy and McDermott play all of the SF minutes should really spread the floor once Butler returns, as there is no way any team is leaving either of these guys if they are spotted up anywhere behind the arc. However, the biggest benefit comes from not having to ever play Tony Snell, as he just continues his refusal to use his skills in any way meaningful. And once Jimmy is back, hopefully having a healthy MDJ/McD means Moore can play the majority of the back-up PG minutes as well.

Finally, a Rose/Butler/Dunleavy/McDermott/Moore PG/SG/SF rotation can compete well with any in the league, outside of the Warriors' Curry/Thompson/Barnes/Iguodala/Livingston.

Portis continues to excel whenever he recieves big minutes - he is now averaging 13.9 points and 7.6 rebounds in the seven games where he's played more than 25 minutes. Now this is obviously a biased stat, as guys play more minutes when they are playing well, but it's still nice to see the rookie having so many impressive games. He is certainly looking like yet another Bulls' steal when drafting in the 20s, and he would more than likely be among consideration for All-Rookie 1st Team if he would have gone to a non-playoff contender and played more (and more consistent) minutes all season.

Not that the Bulls cruised home after taking a 16-point lead into the 4th quarter of this game - they continued their disturbing trend of blowing big leads in the final 12 minutes, allowing the Lakers to pull within 110-107 for the final time when Brandon Bass his two free throws with 4:46 left.

It was still a 5-point game with 2:51 to play before Rose hit a pair of jumpers and a pair of free throws - as well as assisting Gasol on a short jumper - to finally close out the Lakers.

The Bulls are now off until Wednesday, when they host the Wizards in another nationally televised game (ESPN). The rest of the week sees them traveling to Atlanta on Friday (ESPN) and hosting the Blazers on Saturday (CSN-Chicago, NBA League Pass).";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Bullsville";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4655:"The Bulls shot a season-high 55.7%, including 68.4% (13/19) from 3-point range, as they defeated the Lakers 126-115 in Kobe Bryant's final game at the United Center.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the play of rookie PF/C Cristiano Felicio, who came off the bench instead of Cameron Bairstow and posted NBA career-highs of 8 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists and 14 minutes. He certainly earned himself some minutes for Sunday's home game against the Lakers, and may have played well enough to send Bairstow back to Australia permanently.

The Raptors were led by Kyle Lowry, who finished with 27 points and 8 assists. Fellow All-Star DeMar DeRozan had 22 points, but shot only 6/21 from the field. Big man Jonas Valanciunas had 25 points and 12 rebounds, but as usual most of his damage came early in the game - Valanciunas had 11 points and 6 rebounds in 9 first-quarter minutes, but only 14 points and 6 rebounds in 23 minutes the rest of the game.

This one looked like another Bulls loss early, as the Raptors jumped to a 35-24 lead after the first 12 minutes. The Bulls cut the lead to six on a Rose free throw with 7:22 left in the half, but Toronto immediately went on a 9-2 run over the next two minutes to push the lead back to 13 before the Bulls cut it to six at halftime.

The Raptors pushed the lead back to 69-60 with 8:08 left in the 3rd quarter before the Bulls finally exploded on offense. They scored 56 points over the final 20 minutes, with McDermott and Rose combining to score 34 of those points on 16/20 shooting from the field. Gasol, Rose and McDermott combined to score 45 of the Bulls' 64 second-half points, including 43 of the final 56.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/bullsville/files/2014/10/Gasol-Tribune4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2112" alt="gasol blog.bullsville.net" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/bullsville/files/2014/10/Gasol-Tribune4.jpg" width="540" height="283" /></a>

Gasol in particular sent a big "FU" to the overwhelming majority of fans who wanted to see him traded at the NBA trade deadline. McDermott has also been the subject of much fan criticism, and he did a lot to shut them up on this particular evening.

E'Twaun Moore also deserve a bunch of credit for tonight's win, as he contributed 9 points (3/6 FG), 7 rebounds and 6 assists in 34:42. Most importantly, his defense played a huge role in holding Toronto All-Star DeMar DeRozan to 22 points on 6/21 shooting from the field. Moore actually deserved minutes at back-up PG as Aaron Brooks was almost completely useless tonight, adding only 3 points on 1/8 shooting (though he did add an unusually high 4 assists in only 13 minutes).

Tonight's Bulls certainly sent a huge message to the fans who compalined about the team not making a deal at yesterday's NBA trade deadline. They all called for Gasol to be traded for <strong>anything</strong>, but tonight's 18/11/9 surely made most of them look quite stupid.

Yeah, he's sort of important to this team. whether the ignorant fans can see it or not.

Final score <a href="http://www.nba.com/games/20160218/CHICLE/gameinfo.html?ls=iref:nba:scoreboard" target="_blank">Cleveland 106, Bulls 95</a>. Disappointing at first glance, but considering the fact that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/lines" target="_blank">Vegas had the Bulls as 12.5 to 13.5 point underdogs</a>, the team actually performed a little better than expected.

Rookie PF Bobby Portis continued to impressed when given minutes, as he posted another double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds in 26 minutes. In the six games in which Portis has played at least 25 minutes, Portis is averaging 13.3 points and 7.7 rebounds in 27:16. For the season, he is averaging 15.7 points and 10.4 rebounds (4.0 offensive) per 36 minutes.

But since there is no real reason to recap a game in which the Bulls were missing 32% of their total points, 31% of their total rebounds, and 33% of their total assists - not to mention two of their top-3 in 3-point field goals made - we'll move on to some of the more ridiculous comments I read today about the very short-handed Bulls.

I'll warn you, most of them surround the completely ridiculous notion that the Bulls somehow screwed up by not making any trades at the NBA trade deadline (outside the Hinrich for Justin Holiday and a 2nd round pick trade). Nobody knows what deals were or weren't actually available, so how exactly can Gar Forman and John Paxson be blamed for the unknown?

Then again, if you're a reader of the comical <a href="http://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=10" target="_blank">RealGM Bulls' forum</a> or <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-bulls-confidential" target="_blank">Chicago Bulls Confidential</a>, you're probably shocked that the Bulls could even get a 2nd-round pick in exchange for "the worst player in the NBA" (Hinrich)... the fact that they also somehow added a 6'6" lockdown defender who was good enough to play over 600 minutes for the NBA champion Warriors last season should be your first hint as to how clueless many of these Bulls fans are.

Ready for some comedy:

Yeah, uh, KC, you might want to wait to actually <strong>confirm</strong> the actual details of the actual trade before actually confirming the trade as confirmed.

Of course, that tweet can only lead to tweets like this one:

Yeah KC, math is really hard... take Hinrich's ~$2.8 million salary, subtract zero, and get $2.5 million. Gotcha.

Nah, only those who put much stock into a game in which a team is missing its All-Defense guy who guards LeBron while being 11th in the NBA in scoring.

I guess Mr Gottlieb missed those two games earlier in the season when a healthy Bulls team beat the Cavs?

I'm 100% positive that Mr. Karantzoulis has absolutely, positively nothing to worry about...

Don't waste your time looking for anyone who gave the front office credit for getting two assets in exchange for Hinrich. Or for not trading away a player in a salary dump (<a href="https://twitter.com/KCJHoop/status/700020825173422081" target="_blank">as KC Johnson predicted they would</a>), ensuring that the Bulls would pay the NBA luxury tax this season, something the overwhelming majority of fans insisted they would never do now that "the season is lost". Or in general, because Reinsdorf is "cheap and only cares about profits".

Final score <a href="http://www.nba.com/games/20160218/CHICLE/gameinfo.html?ls=iref:nba:scoreboard" target="_blank">Cleveland 106, Bulls 95</a>. Disappointing at first glance, but considering the fact that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/lines" target="_blank">Vegas had the Bulls as 12.5 to 13.5 point underdogs</a>, the team actually performed a little better than expected.

Rookie PF Bobby Portis continued to impressed when given minutes, as he posted another double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds in 26 minutes. In the six games in which Portis has played at least 25 minutes, Portis is averaging 13.3 points and 7.7 rebounds in 27:16. For the season, he is averaging 15.7 points and 10.4 rebounds (4.0 offensive) per 36 minutes.

But since there is no real reason to recap a game in which the Bulls were missing 32% of their total points, 31% of their total rebounds, and 33% of their total assists - not to mention two of their top-3 in 3-point field goals made - we'll move on to some of the more ridiculous comments I read today about the very short-handed Bulls.

I'll warn you, most of them surround the completely ridiculous notion that the Bulls somehow screwed up by not making any trades at the NBA trade deadline (outside the Hinrich for Justin Holiday and a 2nd round pick trade). Nobody knows what deals were or weren't actually available, so how exactly can Gar Forman and John Paxson be blamed for the unknown?

Then again, if you're a reader of the comical <a href="http://forums.realgm.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=10" target="_blank">RealGM Bulls' forum</a> or <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-bulls-confidential" target="_blank">Chicago Bulls Confidential</a>, you're probably shocked that the Bulls could even get a 2nd-round pick in exchange for "the worst player in the NBA" (Hinrich)... the fact that they also somehow added a 6'6" lockdown defender who was good enough to play over 600 minutes for the NBA champion Warriors last season should be your first hint as to how clueless many of these Bulls fans are.

Ready for some comedy:

Yeah, uh, KC, you might want to wait to actually <strong>confirm</strong> the actual details of the actual trade before actually confirming the trade as confirmed.

Of course, that tweet can only lead to tweets like this one:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

Yeah KC, math is really hard... take Hinrich's ~$2.8 million salary, subtract zero, and get $2.5 million. Gotcha.

(If this blog disappears overnight, you'll know the Tribune Corporation - which owns and runs ChicagoNow - wasn't happy with me pointing out the inexcusable inaccuracies of the Bulls beat reporter to whom it pays a hell of a lot of money.

The Bulls should also pick up a Traded Player Exception worth $1,907,664 in the deal (the difference in <a href="http://www.basketballinsiders.com/chicago-bulls-team-salary/" target="_blank">Hinrich's</a> and <a href="http://www.basketballinsiders.com/atlanta-hawks-team-salary/" target="_blank">Holiday's</a> salaries).

However, if the teams structured this trade as two separate trades - with the Hawks using a Traded Player Exception to acquire Hinrich, and the Bulls using the Minimum Player Salary Exception for Holiday - the Bulls would get a TPE for $2,854,940. I'll confirm this as soon as all the details of the trade are released. (<strong>EDIT</strong>: KC Johnson is reporting the TPE is for Hinrich's $2.8 million, but I am still waiting on independent confirmation)

The Bulls will also pick up a 2018 2nd-round draft pick from the Jazz (still not sure where they come in on the trade).<strong> EDIT</strong>: The Jazz get PG Shelvin Mack from the Hawks in the deal.

Holiday, 26, is a 6'6" shooting guard who went undrafted after graduating from the University of Washington in 2011. To date, his greatest NBA accomplishment is playing 59 games last season (including four starts) for the NBA Champion Golden State Warriors. He played only 11 minutes in the playoffs, but he did pick up a championship ring, so he has that going for him.

He also won a few championships in Europe, meaning he has won three championships in his four professional seasons:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Belgian Cup with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_Aalstar" target="_blank">Okapi Aalstar</a> in 2012</span></li>
	<li>Hungarian Cup and Hungarian league championship with <a title="Szolnoki Olaj KK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szolnoki_Olaj_KK">Szolnoki Olaj</a> in 2014</li>
</ul>
He doesn't add 3-point shooting (career 28.8% from behind the arc), but he is very long and athletic and an outstanding defender with a 7'0.5" wingspan. He has been a very good shooter (44.0%) from 10-16 feet in his 1,062 NBA minutes, and he has picked up some defensive accolades along the way:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">2010 Pac-10 All-Defensive Team</span></li>
	<li>2013 D-League All-Defensive 2nd Team</li>
</ul>
Holiday was also named All-NBA D-League 3rd Team in 2013. That was his only full season in the D-League, and he had a pretty good season, averaging 17.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, a league-leading 2.4 steals and 1.2 blocks in 34.7 minutes. He also had an outstanding season from behind the arc, shooting 41.2% on 4.0 attempts per game - which gives hope that he can develop a 3-point shot in the NBA.

While this isn't the big deal Bulls fans were hoping for, at least the team gets more athletic and younger on the wing, and Holiday is signed through next season at the NBA minimum.

Here's a look at Holiday's highlights from his time with Golden State last season:

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/bullsville/2016/02/nba-trade-deadline-bulls-shopping-gasol-gibson/" target="_blank">I summed up a few possible trades yesterday</a>, but then last night the rumors really started flying. The one that seems to have the most legs involves the Bulls sending Pau Gasol to Sacramento.

<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article61001402.html" target="_blank">The Sacramento Bee reported last night</a> that the Kings are "aggressively pursuing Chicago center Pau Gasol", while (per Yahoo! Sports) <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba-trade-deadline-buzz--clippers-move-closer-toward-channing-frye-deal-023959300.html" target="_blank">Adrian Wojarnowski and Chris Mannix of The Vertical</a> each provided details of the rumored deal:
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_2477">The Bulls have discussed deals with multiple NBA teams on Gasol, but one discussion lingered on Wednesday, league sources told The Vertical’s Wojnarowski and Chris Mannix: Gasol and <a id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_1755" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/5190/" data-rapid_p="11">Tony Snell</a> to the <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/sac/" data-rapid_p="12">Sacramento Kings</a> for <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/4485/" data-rapid_p="13">Kosta Koufos</a>, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/5158/" data-rapid_p="14">Ben McLemore</a> and a lowering of <a id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_1680" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/news/guide-to-the-nba-trade-deadline--kings-020334169.html" target="_blank" data-rapid_p="15">the lottery protections on the 2016 first-round pick that Sacramento owes the Bulls</a>.</p>
<p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_2577">The pick is protected Nos. 1-10, but the Bulls and Kings discussed lowering the protections further to give Chicago a better chance of obtaining use of the pick in 2016, league sources told The Vertical.</p>
<p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_2582">The Kings reached out to the <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/phi/" data-rapid_p="16">Philadelphia 76ers</a> on Wednesday, too, league sources said, because the Sixers have the right to swap picks with the Kings’ on the 2016 pick. The Kings wouldn’t be able to complete the deal involving the pick with Chicago unless they could reach an agreement with Philadelphia. The Sixers were preparing to ask for a further sweetener to allow the Kings to move on a deal with Chicago, league sources said.</p>
</blockquote>
It seems highly unlikely that the Sixers' pick would wind up below the Kings', barring the Kings' picking hitting in the lottery and winding up in the top-3. And I can't imagine the Kings lowering their protection with the Bulls to include a top-3 pick. But assuming the Kings pick is a better one, it seems as if the obvious solution would be for the Bulls to agree to continue to grant Philly the right to swap picks even after a Sacramento-Chicago trade.

That being said, the Kings are pretty desperate to make the playoffs this season, and a starting lineup featuring Rajon Rondo, Rudy Gay, DeMarcus Cousins and Gasol certainly looks pretty good on paper. That could possibly lead to the Kings removing all protection on their pick to entice the Bulls into making the trade, though I don't see any way it happens.

If it were to happen, this would be an outstanding return for the Bulls - McLemore has struggled in his 2 1/2 NBA seasons, but he is shooting a career-best 37.3% from behind the arc this season, and the Bulls definitely need to add shooters if they want to maximize Hoiberg's system.

Koufas is a good defender and a decent offensive player, and he has real center size at 7', 265. He doesn't have much range at all on his jumper, but he is a very effective scorer around the basket. He's also an outstanding offensive rebounder, averaging 4.0 offensive boards per 36 minutes with a 12.7% offensive rebound percentage for his career.

Koufas is also signed for two more seasons at very reasonable salaries of $8,046,500, $8,393,000 and $8,739,500 (the final year is a player option).

The only possible road block to this deal is an offer from Cleveland of Iman Shumpert (<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article61001402.html" target="_blank">who the Kings are also interested in</a>) and Timofey Mozgov for McLemore and Koufas.

While 99.9% of NBA trade deadline rumors never come to fruition, it should be an interesting day for Bulls fans. There is always the possibility that the team makes a deal to dump just under $4.5 million in salary to get under the luxury tax threshold - but if they can pull off this Gasol deal, I'm sure they'd gladly pay the tax this season (Gasol and Snell for McLemore and Koufas actually adds almost $2 million to this season's payroll).";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Bullsville";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5809:"As the NBA trade deadline approaches (2 PM CT), things are certainly getting interesting for Bulls fans.

The one that seems to have the most legs involves the Bulls sending Pau Gasol to Sacramento.

<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/kings-blog/article61001402.html" target="_blank">The Sacramento Bee reported last night</a> that the Kings are "aggressively pursuing Chicago center Pau Gasol", while (per Yahoo! Sports) <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba-trade-deadline-buzz--clippers-move-closer-toward-channing-frye-deal-023959300.html" target="_blank">Adrian Wojarnowski and Chris Mannix of The Vertical</a> each provided details of the rumored deal:
<blockquote>
<p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_2477">The Bulls have discussed deals with multiple NBA teams on Gasol, but one discussion lingered on Wednesday, league sources told The Vertical’s Wojnarowski and Chris Mannix: Gasol and <a id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_1755" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/5190/" data-rapid_p="11">Tony Snell</a> to the <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/sac/" data-rapid_p="12">Sacramento Kings</a> for <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/4485/" data-rapid_p="13">Kosta Koufos</a>, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/5158/" data-rapid_p="14">Ben McLemore</a> and a lowering of <a id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_1680" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/news/guide-to-the-nba-trade-deadline--kings-020334169.html" target="_blank" data-rapid_p="15">the lottery protections on the 2016 first-round pick that Sacramento owes the Bulls</a>.</p>
<p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_2577">The pick is protected Nos. 1-10, but the Bulls and Kings discussed lowering the protections further to give Chicago a better chance of obtaining use of the pick in 2016, league sources told The Vertical.</p>
<p id="yui_3_18_1_1_1455805869775_2582">The Kings reached out to the <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/phi/" data-rapid_p="16">Philadelphia 76ers</a> on Wednesday, too, league sources said, because the Sixers have the right to swap picks with the Kings’ on the 2016 pick. The Kings wouldn’t be able to complete the deal involving the pick with Chicago unless they could reach an agreement with Philadelphia. The Sixers were preparing to ask for a further sweetener to allow the Kings to move on a deal with Chicago, league sources said.</p>
</blockquote>
It seems highly unlikely that the Sixers' pick would wind up below the Kings', barring the Kings' picking hitting in the lottery and winding up in the top-3. And I can't imagine the Kings lowering their protection with the Bulls to include a top-3 pick. But assuming the Kings pick is a better one, it seems as if the obvious solution would be for the Bulls to agree to continue to grant Philly the right to swap picks even after a Sacramento-Chicago trade.

Honestly, I'm not sure there's a huge market out there for Gasol, and I haven't heard of a single rumor of any possible deals that might be out there.

<a href="https://twitter.com/thekapman/status/700025013907230720" target="_blank">David Kaplan did tweet</a> that the Bulls are looking for a player, not just a salary dump, which should be their approach. Moving Gasol would certainly seem to indicate that the Bulls are giving up on winning a championship (or even trying to beat Cleveland in the playoffs) this season, which might just be the right way of thinking with the way the team has played as of late.

However, that info is directly contradicted by the Tribune's <a href="https://twitter.com/KCJHoop/status/700020825173422081" target="_blank">KC Johnson, who tweeted</a> that the most likely scenario with Gasol is clearing salary to get under the luxury tax threshold - which makes sense in a season that is apparently going nowhere anyway. That being said, there's no reason the Bulls can't lower their payroll and get an asset in return for Gasol.

Another rumor making the rounds has the Bulls offering up Taj Gibson to the Raptors in exchange for PF Patrick Patterson. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14783975/the-nba-trade-deadline-full-big-names-cap-questions" target="_blank">Zach Lowe dropped this tidbit</a> in his weekly column on ESPN.com:
<blockquote>Chicago and Toronto had initial discussions on a Taj Gibson-Patrick Patterson swap that would give Chicago yet another stretch power forward and trim its tax bill, but those discussions appear to have led nowhere so far.</blockquote>
While most Bulls fans seem to hate this deal, I think it's a good one for the Bulls. As Lowe pointed out, it gives Hoiberg another stretch 4, it saves the Bulls about $2 million this year and $3 million next, and it makes the roster younger (Patterson is 26, Gibson 30).

Another rumor being floated by <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Broussard/status/700143160605937664" target="_blank">Chris Broussard</a> has the Bulls showing interest in Sacramento SG Ben McLemore.

<blockquote>Word is that the Kings, who are desperate to end a playoff drought spanning nine seasons and counting before moving into a new building next season, prefer immediate help in trade talks more than future picks.</blockquote>
Of course the Bulls have a vested interest in seeing the Kings make the playoffs, as this would mean that Sacramento would have to send their top-10 protected 1st-round draft pick to Chicago this summer. And adding McLemore, who is shooting over 37% from behind the arc this season, to the backcourt would be a huge bonus as well.

It should be an interesting evening and afternoon, as it seems like the Bulls might be actively involved in trade talks at the NBA trade deadline.

The Bulls have stood pat at the NBA trade deadline the last few seasons, and most fans expect them to do the same this season. Of course, this is because most fans expect them to completely fleece another team in a trade, which is of course completely unrealistic.

John Paxson and Gar Forman are constantly accused of overvaluing their assets, while fans consistently call out rumored deals as ridiculous while proposing deals of their own that actually DO overvalue Bulls' players:

(From the busiest Bulls' fan forum on the internet):
<blockquote>In the circumstance we did trade Jimmy (Butler), I can think of 2 trade partners that would make more sense - Milwaukee and Portland. I would prefer (Khris) Middleton + (Jabari) Parker+ (draft) picks or (CJ) McCollum + (Noah) Vonleh + (Allen) Crabbe + pick to (Victor Oladipo) + (Nikola Vucevic) + pick.</blockquote>
Really?

Who wouldn't?

If you need reminding, Middleton is a 6'8" shooting guard who is giving the Bucks 18/4/4 this year while shooting 40.5% from behind the arc and playing pretty good defense. Parker is a year removed from being the #2 overall pick in the 2014 draft. AND this guy expects the Bucks to throw in a draft pick??

McCollum is a 6'4" shooting guard who is averaging almost 21 points per game on 39.2% 3-point shooting in his 3rd NBA season. Crabbe is a 6'6" shooting guard who averages over 11 points/game in his 3rd year, while Vonleh is a 6'10" power forward who is only 20 years old and less than two years removed from being a top-10 draft pick.

In addition to trading Butler for one of these packages, maybe they can trade Kirk Hinrich and Mike Dunleavy for Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Surely they can move Taj Gibson and Aaron Brooks for LeBron James and Kyrie Irving?

I've tried to look at the Bulls' NBA trade deadline options from a comical point of view tonight, tomorrow I'll look at what deals the Bulls might actually have a chance of pulling off before Thursday afternoon rolls around.

But for some completely inexplicable reason, Kirk Hinrich fouled Ellis ON PURPOSE with 1.2 seconds left, giving Ellis three free throws and sending the game into overtime.

<h2>Kirk Hinrich 1, Bulls 0</h2>
It makes sense for Hinrich to foul Ellis as he crossed half court, forcing Ellis to make the first free throw and intentionally miss the second for the Mavs to have any prayer of forcing overtime. But Kirk waited until Monta was close enough to the basket to shoot an actual 3 in rhythm, and the official had no choice but to award him three free throws.
<h2>Kirk Hinrich should know better</h2>
Kirk Hinrich is a long-time NBA veteran, he absolutely has to know better than to wait until Ellis was in shooting range to commit that foul.

Kirk Hinrich had absolutely no excuse for what he did.

Kirk Hinrich officially cost the Bulls this game.

Thibs did learn his lesson, so I guess that's good?

Kirk Hinrich did not see the floor in either overtime period, even though he had finished the game in regulation. Thibs benched him in favor of Dunleavy in OT 1 and OT 2, and while I am not one to overreact to one bad play, this one was absolutely inexcusable.

Completely, absolutely, 100% without a shadow of a doubt, inexcusable.

As far as I am concerned, Kirk Hinrich played himself out of the game-ending rotation by handing the Mavs this game. It was won, barring a miracle 3 by Ellis, and Hinrich gave the Mavs life.
<h2>Gasol was outstanding</h2>
Pau Gasol continues to show why he was such an outstanding free agent signing, playing 50 minutes tonight and giving the Bulls a season-high 29 points to go along with 14 rebounds. His 19 points in the second half and overtime, hitting big shot after big shot to keep the Bulls in the game.

Jimmy Butler struggled from both the field (9/21) and the free throw line (5/9), but he had a pretty good game overall with 23 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists (with only 1 turnover) in 46 minutes.

Joakim Noah had another good game as he recovers from off-season knee surgery, with 8 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 blocked shots and 2 steals.

Nikola Mirotic had another nice all-around game, contributing 15 points (4/8 FG, 7/8 FT), 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 blocked shots in his 26 minutes. For me, the only question is what kind of return the Bulls can get for Taj Gibson, because there is no excuse for Niko to only play 10 minutes a night once Taj is healthy again.
