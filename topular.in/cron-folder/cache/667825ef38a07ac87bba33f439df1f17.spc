Because we traveled all the way to Irvington and in an effort to save the trip and lunch, we decided to visit Jockamo Upper Crust Pizza located right next door.</p><p><a

I tend to find the pizza offered at most of the pizza places around here unimaginative and pretty damn dreadful, so I didn&#8217;t go into Jockamo&#8217;s in a positive frame of mind. I just expected the regular same old crap offered everywhere else. Speaking of which, Pizza Hut&#8217;s new commercial cracks me up.&#8221; Are you settling for the same old same old? How about Pizza Hut&#8217;s The Original!&#8221; I wonder what genius dreamt up that slogan.</p><p>Anyway, back to the review. What I found at Jockamo Upper Crust Pizza was surprisingly different and a cut above what you find in those same old, same old pizza places.</p><h2>Ambiance</h2><p>Aside from the construction cloths blocking up the old bar area where they are expanding the kitchen, Jockamo&#8217;s has an extremely relaxed atmosphere. The interior is a combination of old industrial brick and concrete combined with a nice yellow and ochre paint job. There are half booths against one wall with benches facing the interior of the restaurant, old wooden tables to seat four in the middle, and an entirely new addition that can seat at least 40 or 50 additional diners not to mention the new bar and patio dining area. The works of local artists are also on the wall with one striking monkey in a top hat painting for a price I cannot even begin to fathom. Overall the effect is welcoming and visually entertaining.</p><p><a

Octogenarians and middle class families along with young urban chic and retro rock and rollers combined for a kaleidoscope of humanity for those who like to observe people.</p><h2>Service</h2><p>The service was quick. The drinks were filled as soon as they were finished and the staff came around often to see how we were doing. I&#8217;ve not had better service anywhere else.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>Like the service, the cleanliness of Jockamo&#8217;s was impeccable. I don&#8217;t feel it necessary to expand any further on the subject.</p><h2>Food</h2><div

But to give you a good restaurant review I must be honest. I really don&#8217;t care for the ubiquitous meat lovers or supreme pizzas smothered in mozzarella that passes for the regular pizza fare around here. My favorite pizza of all-time is a large Calzone with salami, ham, mushrooms, tomato sauce, pickled artichoke hearts, and provolone/Gouda/feta cheese, followed closely by an Italian sausage and mushroom pizza with sliced banana peppers and the same kind of cheese topping. So my taste in pizza is a bit out of the ordinary. Blame it on my misspent youth.</p><p>In this case Jockamo&#8217;s is a pizza place whose flavors are right up my alley. I ordered a 16-inch pizza split into two. One side was the Slaughterhouse Five, honoring Indiana&#8217;s own Kurt Vonnegut, and the other side was a Heidi Hernandez. Jeff, continuing his commitment to a low carb diet, chose the Whole Romaine lettuce salad with grilled chicken.</p><p><a

class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-959" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Whole Romaine lettuce salad with grilled chicken" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Salad-300x198.jpg" alt="Whole Romaine lettuce salad with grilled chicken" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Salad-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Salad-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Jeff&#8217;s salad was pretty tasty. Using whole romaine lettuce leaves to create a bowl, they fill it with red onions (a lot of red onions), bacon, chopped tomatoes, and grilled chicken with a mild Gorgonzola cheese dressing. It was very good, although Jeff said he tasted onions for the rest of the day!</p><p><a

The first thing I did was immediately box half of it because there was no way I&#8217;d be able to eat the whole thing in one sitting. The Slaughterhouse Five is an all meat pizza topped with pepperoni, ham, sausage, bacon, and Italian beef. It was unusual in the fact that the meats were all chopped up and they didn&#8217;t throw a ton of cheese on top. The chopped meats allowed their flavors to meld and you could taste the tomato sauce and cheese separately. If you are a carnivore I highly recommend this pizza to you. What really struck my fancy though was the Heidi Hernandez. This pizza is an unusual mixture of Mexican chorizo sausage, tomatoes, red onion, and Swiss cheese. From the description it just didn&#8217;t sound all that appetizing, yet the mild spiciness of the chorizo works well with the mild bitterness of the Swiss cheese and I couldn&#8217;t have been more happily surprised. If you are up for an adventure for your taste buds you should really try this pizza! Jeff had a couple of slices of each, minus the crust of course, and he wholeheartedly agreed with me.</p><p>One more thing, I really enjoyed the crust. It was nice and crispy along the edges and chewy under the toppings, a real winner in my book.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>I was really pleased with Jockamo Upper Crust Pizza. The flavors are original, the crust crispy AND chewy, and the people watching made this a great place to visit for a meal. I&#8217;m looking forward to my next visit when I can order a 16-inch half meatball pizza and half sausage and mushroom with banana peppers topped with smoked Gouda and feta cheese.</p><p>In summary: Jockamo&#8217;s ain&#8217;t your same old same old, $5 a medium one topping pizza place!</p><p><b>Jockamo Upper Crust Pizza</b><br

One World Market is kind of a misnomer. If you were looking for a truly international market you&#8217;d think that One World Market would be the place, right? Wrong! One World Market is a Japanese grocery with a food bar attached. As a matter of fact, the whole area behind the counter and fish cooler is a kitchen and they serve around 40 standard dishes and a daily special.</p><p>On this review I went completely solo. Jeff doesn&#8217;t really care for raw fish and as Japanese food doesn&#8217;t really lend itself to a low carbohydrate diet, Jeff decided he was better off working at his regular job as an Archaeologist.</p><p>Fortunately for One World Market I had to visit the place twice due to the fact that on my first visit the photos I took with my camera phone were complete crap. So armed with my trusty Nikon I went back, had another meal, and took some more photos. My second meal there was much better than the first and changed my overall rating. I&#8217;ll explain further in the Food section of our review.</p><p><a

If I looked around and listened to the different languages being spoken, I could possibly imagine myself in a food kiosk somewhere in Japan. Other than that; however, the place is strictly business and has more of an industrial cafeteria feel than any thing else.</p><p><a

You order, pay, and pick up your food at the counter. Then it is up to you to find a seat, get your silverware, and clean up after yourself.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>Even with this self service feature, the grocery and eating areas were neat and clean. The kitchen, which is visible from the counter, was also very clean. One word of caution; however, I could not find a public bathroom in the place.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>My first time visiting the Old World Market, I had the Sushi special platter and an order of Spicy Tuna Roll. Unfortunately, there are no photos due to my crappy photo taking. Overall the food was fresh, although the avocado in the rolls was showing the signs of darkening due to oxidation. The sushi was fresh, but I didn&#8217;t find it anything special and based on this meal I was going to award One World Market a single piggy.</p><p><a

This consisted of a single Shrimp Tempura (although because of the size, I suspect it was a prawn, not that I am complaining. I love prawns!) served with Udon noodles in a wonderful tasting dashi garnished with scallions and a slice of kamaboko . There was a mini Tekka Don served with the special as well. This dish was a kind of salad, made with a combination of red tuna both as a hash and sashimi pieces and served with sour rice and sweet mushrooms. On this occasion I was blown away by the food! I&#8217;ve had many a bowl of Udon noodles and these were great! I had never had Tekka Don before, but I cannot imagine it could have been any better made. If I were to base my review on this last meal alone, the One World Market would receive three piggies!</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>So here it is, I made two trips to One World Market and I had a great lunch and a mediocre one. Take from that what you will. Personally, I will be ordering the daily special from now on. I&#8217;m not sure One World Market would be the best place to take someone on a romantic date, but personally I would be tempted to take a first date here just before a movie because it would be a great way to learn more about her. I&#8217;d be up for lunch here just about anytime though.</p><p>In summary: Order one of the daily specials, it will be an adventure but you&#8217;ll probably wind up delighted.</p><p><b>One World Market</b><br

The company has been in business nearly 25 years starting in Fishers and then expanding as far as downtown Indianapolis over the last 15 years. Claiming to be &#8220;fresh and local&#8221;, I’m not sure they mean the same thing as most other restaurants mean by that phrase. Still, on to the review.</p><h2>Ambiance</h2><p>The decor is tasteful with a modern flair using brick, Corian-topped tables, high back bench seating, and spot lighting to impart a more intimate ambiance. I&#8217;m not sure they really achieve the intimacy because with the open floor plan and the proximity of seating, it doesn&#8217;t quite lock down the intimacy the decor is meant to convey. Still it is very comfortable and inviting.</p><p><a

They are friendly, courteous, and above all, fast.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>In all the years I have visited Sahm&#8217;s I could never fault their cleanliness. Truly, Sahm&#8217;s cleanliness is a trait many other restaurants should emulate.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>While the food is definitely fresh, I&#8217;m not exactly sure it originates from local sources. So if you are expecting a restaurant using strictly local ingredients, take the claim with a little more than a pinch of salt.</p><p>This time around I stayed clear of the seafood and ordered a Hoosier favorite, a Mesquite Grilled Tenderloin Sandwich (Hey! It’s a tenderloin OK?) with a side of onion rings and a garden Feta salad. Lo-Carb Jeff ordered himself the Steakhouse Tavern Salad.</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Side_Salad.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-908" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Garden Feta Salad" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Side_Salad-300x198.jpg" alt="Garden Feta Salad" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Side_Salad-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Side_Salad-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It didn&#8217;t take long for the food to arrive. The salad I ordered was extremely cold and I was a bit surprised to find iceberg lettuce as the base of a Feta salad. Still the crunch of the iceberg was pleasant and I will have to try it at home sometime. Other than that the salad was what I expected and run of the mill.</p><p><a

class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-909" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Mesquite Grilled Tenderloin Sandwich " src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pork_Tenderloin__Onion_Rings-300x198.jpg" alt="Mesquite Grilled Tenderloin Sandwich " width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pork_Tenderloin__Onion_Rings-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Pork_Tenderloin__Onion_Rings-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The Mesquite Grilled Tenderloin Sandwich was fresh but there was no evidence to show it was grilled I got no mesquite flavor whatsoever. Also the tenderloin itself was rather thin and not big like a Hoosier tenderloin should be. Other than that, the sandwich was good.</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Steakhouse_Tavern_Salad.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-911" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Steakhouse Tavern Salad" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Steakhouse_Tavern_Salad-300x198.jpg" alt="Steakhouse Tavern Salad" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Steakhouse_Tavern_Salad-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Steakhouse_Tavern_Salad-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Jeff&#8217;s Steakhouse Tavern Salad on the other hand was great. The steak was well seasoned and tender and the Balsamic vinaigrette on the salad worked as a perfect counterpoint to the steak. This is an excellent dish. Also it was served with a side of Sahm&#8217;s sour cream streusel cake, which is delicious.</p><p>I should make mention of another dish as it is one of my favorites from Sahm&#8217;s. If you like taco salads like I do, you’ll enjoy J.R.&#8217;s Taco Salad. The servings are generous, the taco meat savory and it is loaded! Besides it comes with a slice of the sour cream cake. Make sure you order it with salsa ranch with an extra salsa ranch. You won&#8217;t be disappointed!</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>What can I say about Sahm&#8217;s? Up until the shrimp incident, I could always count on Sahm&#8217;s freshness and consistency. Considering my latest experience, I would say that was an aberration and Sahm&#8217;s good name is restored (at least in my mind it is). And I have no problems recommending Sahm&#8217;s to you.</p><p>In summary: Try the Sahm&#8217;s Steakhouse Tavern Salad, and if you dare, J.R.&#8217;s Taco Salad. They are delicious!</p><p><strong>Sahm&#8217;s Restaurant</strong><br

I mentioned a Soul Food restaurant that I had found in Fishers and Jeff reminded me that we had just recently reviewed a place near there. Then I mentioned Westfield, because we have yet to review a restaurant there, and we got to discussing what restaurants were located there. One of us mentioned Big Hoffa’s BBQ, but we decided against it because we just recently reviewed some BBQ. One of us mentioned Sushi (probably me) but I feel a little ambivalent about fish currently because of the Fukoshima Reactor leak in Japan causing all the Tuna in the Pacific Ocean to glow.</p><p>Finally we hit on Mexican and since it had been awhile since we’d reviewed a Mexican joint we had a winner. I think I have also mentioned before that Mexican food seems to always be a style of food everyone can agree on, and here’s the proof of it!</p><p>We decided to review El Jaripeo in Westfield. El Jaripeo is an Indianapolis chain owned by the same family and related to the local El Rodeo chain of restaurants as well. I remember the first El Jaripeo restaurant opening off of East Washington Street in Indianapolis. That store was my family’s first choice for family gatherings and we even held my wedding rehearsal dinner there! Although my folks are no longer with us, my siblings and our families still meet from time to time at their new store; which is next to Kroger’s, across East Washington Street from the old location, and next to the discount movie theater.</p><h2><a

The cantina with saloon doors just off to the side from the main dining area enhance that theme.</p><p>Over all the feeling is welcoming and if you want a little privacy, the booths easily give you that feeling. If you need a dining area separate from the main dining area there is a smaller dining room towards the rear of the restaurant that can easily be roped off.<a

There was an adequate number of servers to handle the crowd and as we walked in we were quickly greeted and led to a table. Chips and two different types of salsa, which we’ll get to a bit later, were brought out along with menus and our drink orders were taken immediately.</p><p>Our waiter was very solicitous. He checked on our drinks often and cleared our plates quickly. We didn&#8217;t have to wait long for anything and that included the check at the end of the meal.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>The restaurant looks to be newly or nearly newly remodeled. Everything was well maintained and sanitary. The bathroom was clean and pleasant smelling. What I could see of the kitchen was clean and I saw nothing that would give me a reason to question the freshness or the quality of the food.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>OK… Now for the most important part of the review, the FOOD! Like I said earlier, I have been visiting the El Jaripeo restaurant on the East Side of Indy for nearly 20 years, and I really enjoy the food. Considering that I have only been to this particular location once or twice before in the nearly 13 years I have lived in Hamilton County; however, I will treat this review like most every other I have done by describing the dishes we actually ordered.</p><p>Since chips and salsa are the first thing served to a customer in each and every Mexican restaurant I have ever been to, let’s start there. El Jaripeo served us two different types of salsa, one was red and the other was white. The red was tomato based of course, and was well put together. The sauce was thick with nice chunks of tomato, bits of a mild pepper, a little onion, cilantro, and some garlic. The combination was very tasty. The white sauce seemed to be based on a dressing similar to Miracle Whip. There were some other flavors in there as well including red pepper. Although it too had a pleasant flavor, I much prefer the red salsa. The chips were fresh, thin, and crisp. By themselves they were lightly salty and a little sweet. I’d say the chips were just as good as those I get at El Camino Real (see our review on this restaurant).</p><p>As I was munching on the chips and salsa (Jeff’s on a low carb diet remember?), we perused the menu. Jeff, trying to recover from a weekend full of junk food debauchery and booze at the University of Michigan vs. Notre Dame football game, decided to go for the Lunch Fajitas, beef. I ordered the Chili Rellenos and Carnitas.</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fajitas.jpg"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-891" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Lunch Fajitas with Salsas" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fajitas-300x198.jpg" alt="Lunch Fajitas with Salsas" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fajitas-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fajitas-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>When our orders arrived, Jeff was surprised that his Lunch Fajita did not come out on a sizzling, cast-iron skillet. With the first bite of his fajita; however, he completely forgot about the skillet. The beef was extremely flavorful with the edges pleasantly crisped and he also couldn&#8217;t get over how flavorful the refried beans were. I had a taste of his fajita meat and it was everything he described.</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Carnitas.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-892" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Carnitas" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Carnitas-300x198.jpg" alt="Carnitas" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Carnitas-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Carnitas-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Now on to my order. For those of you that do not know what Chili Rellenos are, I should explain that there are two styles. One style is a fresh poblano pepper stuffed with cheese, and sometimes ground meat, battered, fried, and served with a red sauce on top. The other style consists of sliced roasted poblano peppers mixed with ground beef and covered with a boat load of gooey, melted cheese. El Jaripeo serves the latter and they are excellent. The beef is well seasoned, the roasted poblano adds a grassy flavor, and what is there not to love about melted queso blanco? A word of caution though, poblano peppers are normally extremely mild with no bite whatsoever. Once in a great while; however, you’ll get a spicy one and if you aren’t used to a little heat, you may not be up to eating it. Usually a restaurant will be willing to replace it, but sometimes not. I think of it as a game of Mexican roulette!</p><p>When testing a Mexican restaurant for the first time I generally order Carnitas, which is seasoned roast pork with sautéed onions. The primary reason I order Carnitas is when done right they are absolutely delicious. More importantly though, as good as they are, they aren’t often ordered. So if the Carnitas are moist, tender, and delicious, you can be pretty sure the rest of the menu will be well done as well. The Carnitas at El Jaripeo, lived up to my expectations. They were fork tender, and every bite was a little bit of porky heaven in my mouth. I should mention that they are served here with flour tortillas; however, for a more authentic experience order them with soft corn tortillas. As for the accompanying refried beans and Spanish rice, they are definitely superior to most Mexican joints I have visited over the years.</p><p>I should also mention that Jeff and his wife returned to El Jaripeo on Jeff’s diet cheat day so that he could eat as many carbs as he wanted. They had a shrimp burrito and a shrimp quesadilla. They both decided El Jaripeo is now their &#8220;go- to&#8221; Mexican restaurant and I can’t say I blame them.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>Reasonably priced, fresh food with superior flavors makes El Jaripeo in Westfield a deserving namesake of the original restaurant located on East Washington Street in Indianapolis. If you are located in Hamilton County and are a fan of Mexican food, you will find it well worth your while to give this restaurant a visit.</p><p>In summary: Order the Carnitas, make sure you order them with maize tortillas instead of the flour ones and ¡Provecho!</p><p><b>El Jaripeo</b><br

href="http://lordashleyseatery.com">Lord Ashley&#8217;s Pub &amp; Eatery</a> in Indianapolis for as long as I have lived here. The original, located in Cherry Tree Plaza, closed down a few years ago. The one in Oaklandon; however, is still open and has been operating for nearly 20 years under a different owner from that of the original.</p><h2>Ambiance</h2><p>Ambiance is a bit like a 1970&#8217;s steakhouse with dark colors, wood paneling, and low lights, which make for a very dark atmosphere. In my opinion the place could use a bit of a face lift. I don&#8217;t think the decor has changed since my last visit over ten years ago.</p><p><a

The place wasn&#8217;t very busy but the service was still a bit slow and I tend to be pretty tolerant of slow service. There were essentially three sets of customers while we were there and one was finishing up. It took a while to get drinks refilled and for the food to arrive once we made our order.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>The bathroom, though worn, was very clean. It was dark in the restaurant but it was easy to tell the carpet was well beyond its usable lifespan and should be replaced. Otherwise the place was tolerably clean and the tables were cleared and cleaned fairly promptly after the customers left.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>The food was kind of a mixed bag here. We ordered Rotisserie Chicken Wings as an appetizer. Jeff ordered the Lord Ashley&#8217;s Famous Burger with homemade potato chips and, feeling like eating a bit light, I ordered the Taco Salad.</p><p><a

Still, combined with the wonderfully chunky blue cheese dressing I say it is a winner. The blue cheese dressing is made in-house and is probably the chunkiest dressing I have ever tasted.</p><p><a

It was a half-pounder loaded with sautéed onions, bacon, American and Swiss cheese, and flavored with some kind of Cajun spices. I thought it was a touch over-cooked but otherwise quite tasty. The homemade potato chips were great. They were fresh, crisp, and also had the Cajun seasoning. I couldn&#8217;t stop eating them!</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Taco_Salad.jpg"><img
class="size-medium wp-image-876 alignright" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Taco Salad" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Taco_Salad-300x198.jpg" alt="Taco Salad" width="300" height="198" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Taco_Salad-300x198.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Taco_Salad-150x99.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The major disappointment of the day was the Taco Salad. Where to start? First the corn chips were stale. In a restaurant this is unforgivable. Second, their special chili tasted to me like Wolf brand, canned chili. Third, what little taco meat there was in the salad was presented as a little cold meatball. It wasn&#8217;t even properly heated. The serving looked generous but was seriously lacking in anything substantial that you normally find in a taco salad. I cannot recommend this dish in anyway, unless you want to walk away hungry. The thing I found unforgivable was the condition of the corn chips. Never, ever, serve stale food to a customer. It makes them wonder what else they were served that was less than fresh and it was this faux pas that weighed most heavily in the rating this restaurant received.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>I cannot really recommend this restaurant. I&#8217;m not even sure I am willing to go back to give them a second chance. Like I said earlier, the worst thing a restaurant can do is serve something that is less than fresh to a customer. Once detected, it makes the customers question everything they&#8217;ve eaten that evening. I even wondered if that could have been why the burger was overcooked.</p><p>In summary: I wouldn&#8217;t bother.</p><p><b>Lord Ashley&#8217;s Pub &amp; Eatery</b><br

Zacky&#8217;s is located in a tiny strip mall off of South Rangeline Road in Carmel, just a bit north of 116<sup>th</sup> Street, on the east side of the road. If you blink you might miss it and that would be a culinary tragedy of epic proportions, for you at least.</p><h2>Ambiance</h2><p><a

The place always seems to be busy and noise levels can be fairly high with all the coming and going of the customers, conversations, and kitchen noises going on.</p><h2>Service</h2><p>Ordering is a simple affair; walk up to the counter, look at the menu written on the white board, and place your order. Sit down at one of the tables or stand and wait for your name to be called. They offer free refills on drinks and there is always someone available to top your drink off or take another order should you find yourself still a touch peckish like we did.<a

When ordering you can see into the kitchen area and it is impeccably clean. The floors and bathroom are clean and there is always someone busy clearing tables and wiping down everything.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>OK, now this is where Zacky&#8217;s really shines. Jeff and I walked in with the idea of having a bit of a dog feast where we each order two or three hot dogs and share the flavors. But when I realized that Zacky&#8217;s had BBQ on the menu along with one of my favorite sides, Mixed Greens, plans changed! I ended up ordering the Beef Brisket sandwich with a side of Mac-N-Cheese and an order of Mixed Greens. Jeff ordered The Chicago and Indy Blue hot dogs with a side of Onion Rings.</p><p><a

The Chicago was a Chicago style hot dog. It was good, just like any Chicago dog I have ever had, and it satisfied a craving. The Indy Blue on the other hand was an original! I thought it was a Colts gimmick, but when I bit into that hot dog and tasted the explosion of blue cheese and bacon in my mouth, I was sold. Zack&#8217;s Indy Blue is now my favorite hot dog hands down! The Onion Rings were good but nothing to write home about, but the Mixed Greens and Mac-N-Cheese were another story altogether. The Mixed Greens were savory, lightly salted, and had a nice smoky zing from the ham hocks. They gave me goose bumps! Who’d a thunk? The Mac-N-Cheese is homemade, creamy, with a brown caramelized crust. They are extremely flavorful and will have your kids turning their noses up at Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese from the first taste! Jeff and I were bowled over by the flavors.</p><p><a

The brisket in my sandwich was sliced, not shredded. There was a good quarter of an inch of smoke ring on that meat and it was tender, smoky, and delicious. Most of the BBQ I have had here in Indiana is grilled, or even worse parboiled, shredded and drowned in sauce. Often times it has had the piss smoked out of it and I end up spending the rest of the day burping hickory smoke flavor, yuck!</p><p>I ordered my BBQ sauce on the side and I was happy that I did because it was a commercial style similar to Sweet Baby Rays. Now I’m not against commercial sauces mind you, but to put anything other than a homemade sauce on that quality of a brisket would have been sacrilege! I&#8217;ve eaten and made a lot of BBQ over the years and I must say Zacky&#8217;s is great and will have me coming back for more! Need I say that I got goose bumps again? Funny thing was so did Jeff!</p><p>Now you&#8217;d think we would be done eating by now, BUT WAIT! THERE&#8217;S MORE! Considering how surprised and pleased we were by the non-hot dog offerings Zacky&#8217;s offered, we decided to try a few more Soul Food sides. I ordered some more Mixed Greens along with some Black-Eyed Peas and Great Northern Beans. The flavors reminded me of a time in my childhood when I spent a few weeks with my American grandparents in Arkansas. They were dirt poor and had been all their lives. Their food was simple, but really well made with lots of flavor. While Zacky&#8217;s beans and black-eyed peas were much thicker than those my grandparents fed me, they were dead on in the tenderness and flavors of the beans. Oh and I shouldn&#8217;t leave out that we also had a little taste of BBQ pork tenderloin and rib tips and, like the brisket, they were over the top!</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>If you have a hankering for some Chi-town nostalgia in the form of a tasty Chicago Dog, you’ll be happy with Zacky&#8217;s Hot Dogs &amp; BBQ. The service is quick and the entire staff (family) is friendly and helpful. Like I said in my opening; however, if you think Zacky&#8217;s is only about the dog, you’re missing the boat. Zacky&#8217;s puts out some top notch BBQ and Soul Food. For me, at least, the flavors in the Soul Food sides brought back some great memories and I thanked Zack for helping me recover them. You could tell he was genuinely pleased by that. He and his family love what they do, that’s for sure, and it shows in their food and the pride they take in their restaurant. That is the best reference I can give. That is also why Zack and Toni and their family deserve the four piggies we have awarded them.

I&#8217;ve heard a lot about this place but never actually been to it for a couple of reasons. For one, the hours are limited as they are only open for lunch, and two, I tend to eat late lunches so I&#8217;ve never been able to make it while the restaurant was open. As a matter of fact, Jeff and I were supposed to eat lunch here last week and wound up getting there just as they were closing up shop. So we went to the <a
title="Brugge Brasserie" href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/category/cuisine/european/belgian/">Brugge Brasserie</a> instead and, if you are a regular reader, you’ll know how much we enjoyed it.</p><h2>Ambiance</h2><p>I must say, for a buffet, the Mediterrano Cafe is not typical. If when you think buffet, you conjure up two lines or more of steam trays surrounded by well worn and second hand tables, booths, and chairs then you will be pleasantly surprised with the Mediterrano Cafe. The place is nicely decorated, with ochre walls and tables covered with white butcher paper over white linen. I found the atmosphere to be very pleasant and comfortable.</p><p><a

The restaurant was busy but it didn&#8217;t have that sense of a free for all like many of the buffets I have been to in the past. Likewise, the owner and staff were pleasant and made sure our drinks were filled and our dirty dishes were removed quickly.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>I was very impressed. The staff cleaned and prepped tables immediately after the last patron left. If you didn&#8217;t actually pay attention it would be hard to believe just how busy the place actually was. The steam and cold tables were clean and the trays were changed out rather than refilled. The sneeze guards were well wiped and I couldn&#8217;t find a thing out of place. I felt very comfortable eating here.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>Jeff and I tried to sample everything on the buffet line and I want to make it clear that everything was fresh. The steam trays were not over-filled so the food was as fresh as possible.</p><p><a

To me the blandness of the food tells me that the chef/cook thinks Hoosiers don&#8217;t like spice or seasoning. In fact, I found just about everything except for a very few dishes bland and in need of seasoning. Matter of fact, I was salting everything in order to bring out the flavor. I picked up the salt shaker so often that Jeff remarked on it. As a rule, I never add salt to a restaurant dish, but trust me, if you want to overcome the blandness and bring out the flavor, add salt.</p><p>What Jeff and I found very amusing was all of the dishes that were labeled &#8220;spicy&#8221; were the best seasoned and had little or no heat to them at all. So a quick word of advice, taste dishes labeled &#8220;spicy&#8221; before seasoning them.</p><p><a

Oddly enough, most of them were labeled &#8220;spicy&#8221;.</p><p>Mixed Pickles: Made in-house with carrots, cucumbers, and cauliflower and a couple of dried cayenne peppers for spice. The pickle was mild and very refreshing.</p><p>Cabbage Salad: It was very tasty. This was the first of the dishes I found well seasoned. I was so shocked the only thing I wrote in my notes was &#8220;well seasoned&#8221;. So I am sorry I cannot be any more specific as to flavor!</p><p>Lentil Salad: Labeled &#8220;spicy&#8221;, it turned out to be the best lentil salad I have tasted in forever. The lentils were al dente (you don’t want mushy in a salad) and tangy with just a touch of heat to them. I was very impressed.</p><p>Cabbage Chicken: Well worth trying. Easily my favorite dish on the buffet, ladle it over a bed of rice and your taste buds will be happy!</p><p>The deserts consisted of Coconut Cake and Rice Pudding. I loved the Coconut Cake and found the Rice Pudding a touch too sweet on its own. When combined with the Coconut Cake, however, it makes a great dessert.</p><p>One last note, although the restaurant is Turkish, the dishes are not Halal. The folks concerned with eating Kosher or Halal, will know what I mean. Oh and of course, as part of the Mediterranean tradition, there is plenty for the vegetarian to eat here as well.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>The Mediteranno Cafe is a great diversion from the ubiquitous hamburgers, burritos, and other fast food fare that a 30 minute workday lunch usually offers. The food is fresh, if a bit bland, and there are some really great standouts on the buffet. A bit more expensive than the $5 foot long or meal deal but in my mind well worth the extra few dollars. The Mediterrano Cafe has the potential to earn 3 or more piggies, but in order to do so, will have to up the flavor quotient on everything, not only the dishes labeled &#8220;spicy&#8221;.<b> </b></p><p>In summary: Thirty minutes for lunch should not dissuade you from eating here. Seating seems to be always available and the buffet is well stocked.</p><p><strong>Mediteranno Cafe</strong><br

title="Brugge Brasserie" href="http://www.bruggebrasserie.com/" target="_blank">Brugge Brasserie</a> has a huge shaded outside eating area for when the weather is pleasant. The seating inside consists primarily of wooden tables with copper-clad tops and holes to hold the generously filled cones of Frites (French fries) along with some partial bench seating. A large round communal eating table surrounded by hi-boy stools is the center piece of the bar area. The indoor eating and seating area is painted a light eggplant and anything that isn&#8217;t painted or covered in copper is wooden, the bar area is painted a royal blue. The restaurant is not a great setting for intimacy, but then the Brugge Brasserie is made for socializing not romance.</p><p><a

We found a seat by the large bay window facing north. The lone waitress was quick to offer service. Very personable, she was ready to give answers to our questions and her service was prompt even though she was also manning the bar.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>There is nothing negative of note to report. The tables and floors were clean and the bathrooms sanitary. The plates and silverware were likewise spotless.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>If you like generous servings and delicious Belgian food that you can’t get just anywhere, then the Brugge Brasserie is a fantastic choice. Belgians are famous for their love of Frites (my cousins used to entertain my sister and me with the latest Belgian Frites jokes when we were children) and the Brugge capitalizes on that fact. Everything on the menu, and I mean everything, is served with a serving of Frites along with one or more of the twelve plus sauces they make in-house. Although they are available in three different sizes; small, medium, and enorme (enormous), even the serving they give you with the small sized fries is enough to put me in a diabetic coma.</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mussels.jpg" target="_blank"><img
class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-817" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Mussels" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mussels-300x198.jpg" alt="Mussels" width="300" height="198" /></a>One of my favorite items on the menu is the Moules Frites (mussels and fries). They serve mussels in a baffling array of delicious sauces, each order is served with a nice chunk of “French” bread (a little too thick and soft to be real French bread, but what do you expect, we are in Indiana after all) to soak up the liquor from the bottom of the pot. Being a traditionalist, I&#8217;ve had mussels with the Belgian classic, Beurre Blanc, Provencal, and Citron sauces. Each of them is wonderfully delicious. I often order the extra chunk of bread for 75 cents so I can soak up more of the delectable sauce.</p><p>Another item on the menu competing for the rank of my favorite is the hanger steak. Growing up in France a special treat for us was a plate of Bifteck et Frites, essentially a pan fried steak seared at high temperature in browned butter served with a pile of fries on the side with the pan juices and browned butter poured over the top. So you can imagine I have a certain picture of what a Belgian style hanger steak should look, smell, and taste like and the one they serve at the Brugge is the bomb! If you don’t mind your steak rare, make sure you order it &#8220;bleu&#8221; to get the authentic experience!</p><p>This time around I figured I should try something a bit different from my usual go to orders so I asked our waitress about the Mitraillette (Literal translation: machine gun). The Mitraillette is an open faced French bread sandwich grilled under a broiler. And the Brugge Brasserie offers it in a variety of ways. She suggested the Duck Confit Mitraillette. For those of you that do not know what Duck Confit is, it is duck that has been slowly cooked (submerged) and preserved in its own fat. When done right the duck is extremely tender. You can pull it apart with your fingers and has an unctuous mouth feel. As an appetizer we decided to share a pickled herring salad. Jeff ordered the Moules Frits in the chili sauce.</p><p><a

class="alignright size-medium wp-image-814" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Pickled Herring Salad" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Pickled_Herring_Salad-300x198.jpg" alt="Pickled Herring Salad" width="300" height="198" /></a>The first item to arrive was the Herring Salad. The pickled herring was served in an over-sized wine glass on a bed of chopped endive and shredded raw red cabbage. The glass was set on a plate covered with crushed ice dotted with little nicois olives and petit cornichons. The serving was very generous and had I ordered it as a meal, I would have been very satisfied with the amount of food I was given. As it was, it was a bit too much of an appetizer even for two big guys. Still, the fish was firm, the endive sweet, the cabbage had a pleasant crunch, and the tangy slightly sweet sourness of the herring was both delicious and refreshing.</p><p><a

My sandwich was completely buried in fries! So before I could even take a bite of the Mitraillette I had to work my way through a few dozen fries. For the two sauces that come with my fries I ordered the garlic aioli and the sweet chili sauce. My one complaint about the Brugge is their homemade ketchup. The flavor is, well, there&#8217;s no nice way to say it, awful! I&#8217;ve ordered it a few times, each time thinking that the last one I tried was just a mistake in the recipe, but I have finally given up hope and until they change the recipe I will order a different sauce/condiment. When I finally uncovered my sandwich, I took a bite and thought I had taken a little bite of heaven. The tart spiciness of the mustard combined with the unctuousness of the duck and the sweetness of the cherry and lambic, sent me straight to seventh heaven! I got goose bumps! I had never tasted that combination of flavors before and I was in piggy nirvana! Jeff had a very small taste of my sandwich, a very small taste because I was reluctant to share, and agreed that it was indeed tasty, although he didn&#8217;t have the same reaction I did. Jeff’s chili-sauced mussels were as impeccable and tasty as expected and the bite from the chili peppers was pleasant. There was so much food for me that I had to pack up half my sandwich and fries to take home.</p><p><a

I sampled two ales while I was there and enjoyed them both immensely. Here is a brief run down of each:</p><p>Triple de Ripple &#8211; A strong blond ale 10% alcohol, it starts sweet with a light kick of hops and finishes with a pleasantly bright citrus flavor.</p><p>Harvey Blackberry Ale &#8211; A crisp, tart ale with the light flavor of blackberry. It finishes very clean.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>What more is there to say? I think I pretty much covered everything there is to cover. Want a new adventure this weekend? Then look no further.

Is it me or does the west side have the widest variety of ethnic restaurants in Indy? The Havana Cafe is situated in a small strip mall just at the corner of Moller Road and West 38<sup>th</sup> Street, next to a hair salon that plays hip-hop music at high volume.</p><h2>Ambiance</h2><p><img
class="size-medium wp-image-752 alignright" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Havana Cafe Decor" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Decor-300x225.jpg" alt="Havana Cafe Decor" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Decor-300x225.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Decor-200x150.jpg 200w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Decor.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Havana Cafe is small, intimate, and the music is great. Today they played one samba after the other over the sound system and it lent a wonderful Latin flavor to the place.</p><p>The tables are covered with burgundy tablecloths over white linen and topped with a vase containing a silk flower. The paint, while warm and inviting with primary colors of orange and rust, is inexpertly painted. The walls are decorated with South American and Mexican paintings and copper colored sconces filled with silk flowers. The floors are white linoleum tile with beige flecks in them. Or was it the other way around?</p><p>As you walk in you immediately see the large Cuban flag next to the kitchen door and light stained wood bar in front of that. Next to the bar is a large chalk board that has the day&#8217;s specials listed on it.</p><p><a

Only one waitress was on staff but she was quick to seat us and take our order. She had a very pleasant demeanor and answered all my questions patiently and with a smile. The only small complaint I have is that she forgot Jeff&#8217;s order of fries with his meal. Instead of admitting the omission, and giving him the option of whether he still wanted them or not, she said they were on their way; however, they didn&#8217;t end up arriving until near the end of our meal. Other than that small exception, the service was great.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>Sanitation was adequate, although flushing the toilet in the men&#8217;s restroom was a bit of an adventure. The flush mechanism or float needed to be replaced and it took me three attempts to get it flushed.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>The day we visited the Havana Cafe, they were having a special on Empanadas and fried or boiled Yuca. Taking the waitress&#8217; recommendation we ordered one beef and one chicken Empanada along with an order of fried Yuca to share between us as appetizers. For lunch, I ordered a Cubano (Cuban Sandwich) with a salad and Jeff ordered the Bistec de Carne (Steak Sandwich) with fries.</p><p><a

class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-758" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Chicken and Beef Empanadas" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Empanadas-300x225.jpg" alt="Chicken and Beef Empanadas" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Empanadas-300x225.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Empanadas-200x150.jpg 200w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_Empanadas.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What surprised me about the Empanadas was the difference between the crusts of the beef and the chicken. In my estimation, the chicken’s crust had a much more pleasant crunch, flavor and mouth feel. The beef&#8217;s crust tasted similar to a store bought pot pie crust. Of the two, I was most impressed with the Chicken Empanada. Filled with shredded chicken and a small Spanish olive or two, it was quite savory and had me wanting more. The Beef Empanada pretty much reminded me of a pot pie with taco filling. It&#8217;s only saving grace in my opinion was the sourness of the Spanish olives that were enclosed in the fried crust.</p><p><a
href="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_FriedYuca.jpg"><img
class="alignright size-medium wp-image-759" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="Fried Yuca" src="http://www.phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_FriedYuca-300x225.jpg" alt="Fried Yuca" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_FriedYuca-300x225.jpg 300w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_FriedYuca-200x150.jpg 200w, http://phileatsindy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/HavanaCafe_FriedYuca.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>If you&#8217;ve never had fried Yuca before, I highly recommend it. It tastes very much like potato, but has the crunchy outer texture of butter fried potatoes and the inner thickness of a well baked potato. The waitress recommended that I try the boiled Yuca the next time I visited, as it is boiled in mojito sauce and is pleasantly tangy.</p><p>Now on to the sandwiches, they were large, and I mean LARGE! Each one was easily 6 to 7 inches long and 4 inches wide, and they were cut in half diagonally. Combined with what we had already eaten as appetizers, one half of a sandwich could have easily satisfied the average appetite; however, Jeff and I aren&#8217;t average and neither are our appetites. We traded one half of our sandwiches with each other and got down to the business of eating and evaluating our meals.</p><p><a

I have never had a commercially prepared Cubano in my life, so I was very surprised to find the roast pork finely chopped and the ham very thin and crispy, like bacon. Still, though it was different from what I have eaten in the past, I was not at all disappointed. While I prefer sliced roast pork, the additional saltiness of the crispy ham made a huge difference in flavor and texture, one that I found delightful! Jeff’s Bistec de Carne was also delicious. The beef was marinated in mojito sauce and then grilled well done and made with all the traditional sandwich accoutrements. While I generally like my steak sandwiches a bit on the rare side, the citrusy mojito marinade made all the difference in this sandwich.</p><p>For dessert Jeff and I each ordered a coffee. Jeff a Café con Leche, and I ordered a Cortadito. Jeff’s coffee reminded me of Café au lait, which if you translate both phrases mean the same thing, coffee with milk. My Cortadito, which was dark and sweet, reminded me of a cross between the after dinner coffees served in France and a traditional Espresso.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>The Havana Cafe is a wonderful little place to take a date or friends for a meal and flavor that is out of the ordinary in the Midwest. The servings are generous and the wait staff, friendly and very knowledgeable about the food.</p><p>One word of caution; most of the items, on the lunch menu at least, do not come with accompaniments and must be ordered separately. If you aren&#8217;t careful this can make a relatively inexpensive seeming meal very expensive. Otherwise, prices are quite reasonable and the food is tasty and plentiful.</p><p>In summary: The Havana Cafe brings a little taste of Cuba to Indianapolis. I enjoyed the experience so much I am looking forward to going back for dinner sometime soon, hopefully with a date or a few friends.</p><p><b>Havana Cafe</b><br

This time Jeff and I traveled to the environs of Lafayette Square to sample a style of cuisine that is fairly new to our city, Vietnamese. This cuisine is pretty well known in much larger cities like Chicago, New York, and the West Coast giants of Los Angeles and San Francisco but is just now arriving in the smaller cities of the Midwest.</p><p><a

Our drink orders were quickly taken and we were handed a very large menu with over 150 items listed. Our waiter was friendly, was very happy to answer any questions we had, and had some ready recommendations for us. We were very pleased with the timeliness and quality of the service.</p><h2>Cleanliness</h2><p>Saigon Restaurant is easily among the cleanest restaurants I have visited since I began reviewing restaurants.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>At my first glance at the menu it was easy to see that there was something to please just about all appetites and diets. They even had Pad Thai! Also, with easily 20 dishes on the menu that qualify as vegetarian, they do more than just give a nod to the vegetarian diet. In fact, the only type of diet that appeared to be underrepresented on the menu was a low carbohydrate diet. While there were some dishes that would qualify as low in carbs, you really had to search them out.</p><p><a

This appetizer is made of thinly sliced marinated beef rolled around a type of cheese and then grilled and served with a sweet chili sauce on the side. It was unbelievably delicious! With the first bite I wished I had an order of it all to myself.</p><p><a

My entrée was just as good as the appetizer, redolent with Nuoc Mam or Vietnamese Fish sauce, it tasted of sweet and savory pork and shrimp interspersed with the flavors of basil and peanut. I added a bit of Sriracha hot sauce to add a little kick. The flavors were absolutely titillating!</p><p><a

The Lotus Salad was sweet and tangy with a pleasant crunch of daikon and lotus root. They didn’t skimp on the pork or shrimp either!</p><p>Our experience was so pleasant, I can&#8217;t wait to go back and try something else on their extensive menu.</p><h2>The Juicy Bits</h2><p>Interested in a new, light, and tongue pleasing experience? Then look no further than the Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant. They have the flavors and freshness to please you and enough variety to keep you coming back for more. This was definitely one of my better dining experiences in the last year and I&#8217;m looking forward to my next visit. The only thing that keeps me from giving the them four piggies is that I didn&#8217;t get goose bumps, but don&#8217;t worry there are still plenty of dishes left on the menu that could give them to me!</p><p>In summary: The Saigon Restaurant definitely lives up to its namesake.</p><p><strong>Saigon Restaurant</strong><br
