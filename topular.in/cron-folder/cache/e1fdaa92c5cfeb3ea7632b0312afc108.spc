Our daughter was expecting a baby any day, we had lots of "stuff" to haul to her, and since we didn't know exactly when the baby would arrive, it made more sense to drive than to fly. We were gone about a month, spent two glorious weeks with our new grandson, and enjoyed ourselves in the warm weather.

Here are some decidedly unscientific observations from that trip and thoughts we had along the way.

1. The USA is a beautiful country. This is always my first thought as I drive around the country. It is diverse and glorious. While I don't enjoy the cities and interstates as much as the small towns, the countryside, and the back roads, they are all still fascinating. Each city is a little different. St. Louis with rivers everywhere and Amarillo, which has grown immensely since my last go through, will never be mistaken one for the other. And who knew El Paso was the 19th largest city in the US? It's bigger than Seattle, Denver or Washington, DC.

2. There were signs everywhere for "Help Wanted". On the backs of trucks, in gas stations, mini-marts, retail stores, hotels, and just about everywhere we looked. Not sure what that means. Are they looking for good employees or just someone to do the work? Are they having trouble finding good employees? It seems that if you want a job, you can find one. Some may not pay very well, but others seemed to require more expertise and probably paid better. Unless the signs were very outdated, it seems there are jobs out there if you want one.

3. We traveled through Oklahoma and Texas and saw lots of oil pumps and most of them were pumping oil. Thousands of them! I thought there was an oil glut, so why all the pumping?

4. At every hotel along the way, we saw many business travelers. Not so surprising, but many, if not most, were blue collar business people. They were mostly men who were building large buildings, both retail and commercial, or maybe working on infrastructure building, such as electric power lines and natural gas pipelines. During the day, there were work zones everywhere along the roads, even in forlorn backwaters. We noticed many companies that made or sold pumps or irrigation products, and agricultural products. Also, lots of agriculture businesses were looking for help, or building additions to their current facilities.  We saw several busy mining areas  in New Mexico hauling tons of coal, via both trains and trucks, and a variety of other natural products that are used for road building. Business seemed to be booming in the rural areas if not in the cities.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2016/01/DSCN9638.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1019" alt="DSCN9638" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2016/01/DSCN9638-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>

5. Very long trains are prominent along roads outside the big cities, one after the other on some routes. LOOOONG trains with more than 100 cars. I couldn't count them all. It looks like the economy is booming and products are moving all around the country. While we saw many semis on the roads, we only noticed the trains in the wide open spaces. They are not so visible without long horizons and few trees. But they are definitely on the move.

6. Did I say the country was beautiful? Even in December, there is beauty in the countryside; from the great rivers to the snowy mountain peaks, from the leafless trees in Illinois and Missouri to the cacti and grapefruit trees in the desert. The wild places and small towns are the most appealing to me, but even the cities have uniqueness and their own special appeal.

7. We always play the License Plate game to pass the time. We scored 44 states and 5 Canadian provinces. I also amuse myself by looking at exit signs on interstates that list the towns at that exit. Then I imagine a person who would have that name and what they would be like. Geary Watonga, Kelly Drumwright, Hydro Carnegie, Lyndon Burlington, Paris Holiday. We started writing a mad torrid love story starring McLean Hayworth as the slightly shady love interest and Atlanta Lawndale as the tawdry rich girl who catches his eye.

But that's a blog for another day.

We had four separate visits with Forever Friends!

We had dinner with our furniture friends on Sunday. Tuesday, it was lunch with my best friend from high school and her husband, visiting from Florida. Thursday was a visit from my college roommate from Wisconsin, and Saturday was a college class reunion (my 45th, which does not seem possible) and visits with a variety of college friends.

Our furniture friends are considering retirement from their furniture store and we closed down the restaurant that night, not the first time that has happened among the four of us. The discussions centered on what retirement would look like for them, where they might live, and how it has worked for us after we retired. Sharing a small business experience like we have with them has made a permanent bond that we treasure.

My high school buddy and I reminisced about old times, old friends and how our kids are doing. Lynn and I met when we were 10 in 5th grade church camp. We celebrated our high school graduation together, went off to college together, and although we moved off in our separate ways, she was at the funeral when my father died, and we see each other every few years. More than 55 years have not dimmed our connection.

My college roommate, Marilyn, and I talked about good friends, siblings, parents, kids, and "deep" thoughts about all kinds of things, just like we did late into the night so many years ago. Our friends, classmates, acquaintances and experiences have overlapped so much over the years, that we can often just say a first name and remember all the back story that goes with it.

The classmates from Saturday night talked about the crazy things we did in college. Kids these days have never had a panty raid, more's the pity, or gone streaking. We caught up on what has happened since the last time we met, how the college has changed, and our plans for the future. After all the shared experiences we have had, that night I still discovered things about some of them that I had never known!

I can't believe how lucky this week made me feel.  I'm old enough to realize that life is short and good friends can be hard to come by, but young enough to revel in these visits and look forward to the next ones. Most of us have our health, means enough to live comfortably, sorrows enough to be wiser than we were so many years ago, and expectations of good years ahead that will include more visits together. We mourned the people who no longer can celebrate reunions with us and we shared news about friends who couldn't  join us that evening.

We didn't see the wrinkles and the gray hair, we saw 18-year old kids meeting for the first time, the same way we will always see each other. There was still a sense of adventure and wonder, and the anticipation of what may lie ahead. It will surely be different adventures than we had in college, but when you travel through life with Forever Friends you will always have good times. If you have friends like that, make plans to get together soon.

Oh what joy to be three again! I could repeatedly run around in circles; from the kitchen, the dining area, through the living room, down the hall and back to the kitchen, and then jump into the arms of a happy grandparent when I was done. Then, laughing, sweating, throwing myself around I would collapse in giggles on the floor. Then hop up and do it all over again! Endlessly! What a thrill that would be and Cody sees it as just that thrilling.

He politely waited through lunch and pictures (actually he was distracted by the lunch and endured the pictures),  and then dove right into the presents, opening each one neatly, setting it aside and going on to the next one. Three-year-olds get a lot of gifts when grandparents are involved. Later he went back to the favorites, a garbage truck and a bag of plastic insects, and then asked for the others to be taken out of the plastic one by one so he could play with the new game, the blocks, and the Legos, and sit in his own personal adirondack chair.

After a wonderful afternoon of cookies with candles (Cody doesn't like cake), laughter, balloons and photos, we were ready to leave. Cody does not like anyone to leave. The party should go on until he passes out and no one should go home. (Hmmm, what does this predict for his teen-age years?) He thinks people could sleep in the extra bedroom or on the floor in his room. He just loves a party.

But we were headed up north and innocently asked Cody if he would like to go up north to the lake with us. Big mistake. He said "YES! Go Now?" We explained he could come another time, but he kept shouting "Go Now!" Then he ran into his room, grabbed some clothes out of a drawer, raced to the back door to find his shoes and GO NOW!. He knew it was a long ride, but he had some extra clothes, maybe his pajamas, and he was good to go. We promised him he could go the next time. But he wasn't happy about it.

The older I get, the more I realize "GO NOW" is the best advice in the world. Whether the "going" is to a play or a concert, to church, to see a sick friend, to the library, the grocery store,  or around the world, or up north,  the time to go is truly NOW! What are you waiting for? The years are not endless and the joys are fleeting. Going anywhere is always preferable to staying home.

I know there are always the adult constraints of time, money, or health, but the people we love may not be around when we have the "time" to go. We may not have the good health to go, and many of us don't have the finances to go the way we might like or where we might like or as often as we might like.

But the advice is still good. Go sooner rather than later, go as often as you can, and run around everywhere until you fall down from exhaustion. Grab a change of clothes, get out the door, and enjoy the world, the people and the places you love, and make memories to last forever - for when you really can't "GO" anymore.

Cupp </a>about the University of New Hampshire's guide to "bias-free language". Apparently this so-called "guide" was posted on their website as a way to never offend anyone anywhere and reduce all discourse to a few generic terms for everything.

For instance, you should use the term "parenting" instead of "mothering" or "fathering", as if there is no difference between mothers and fathers and the way they parent.

It encouraged the use of the term "old person" instead of "elderly". Just what, exactly, is an old person? And why is that better than an elderly person? Are you old at 80? 70? 50? Is it age or a state of mind? Are we just supposed to use a few basic words and ignore all the rich colorful ways to designate a person of advanced years? A venerable individual man. A woman of a certain age (I kinda love that one. It implies so much.) Patriarchial, time-honored, inveterate. All great words implying wearing your years well. Which is what we all hope to do.

Of course, an old person can be a fossil, archaic, ancient, antique and other less complimentary words. You get the point.

Is this crazy? Should we want to always be bias free? Does that infringe on free speech?

Good question. Language is so rich, so dynamic, so evocative that to narrow it down is criminal....at least it is to those of us who love to write, share viewpoints, or ponder the vagaries of contemporary life. Anyone who doesn't think so should be required to write a blog on the differences between mothering and fathering, and read Shakespeare plays until they can quote large amounts of dialogue. Or read all the great classic authors, and some contemporary ones (<a title="Dave Robicheaux and the Meaning of Life" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/2013/10/dave-robicheaux-and-the-meaning-of-life/">James Lee Burke</a> and Donna Leon come to mind), who use language so well to evoke times and places that most readers will never actually see. You can't do that with just a few ordinary words used over and over.

If we all had to use the same carefully chosen words, there would be no need for newspapers, magazine, blogs, websites or any other written or spoken word. One essay, written one time would suffice for any idea. No novels, no plays, no poems. They would already all have been written. Or the older ones would be disgraced and unread because they had biased language.

Does it sound like 1984? Mind control? Are "they" going to read our email and find out if we use banned words to talk to our mothers?

It makes you think.

I've been traveling, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, to see relatives. I've been busy with volunteer activities, family things, life in general. No particularly good excuses, just haven't posted.

But I've been following a discussion on a Facebook page the past few days, about young men, boys really, with whom I went to high school who died early in Vietnam.

It's always been hard for me to understand the war in Vietnam even though I grew up and went to high school and college during that time. I guess I was just sort of clueless, but it wasn't until the shootings at Kent State, just shortly before I graduated college, that it really hit home. People were dying! Those kids could have been me! I could have been shot just for doing a "college kid" type of thing.

But there were several guys I knew, Jay Sacks and Johnny Luebke in my high school class, and a couple who were older, who died over there. That put dying young, loss, family grief all into perspective for me, a sheltered, fortunate, kid. I'm not sure if I have still come to terms with their early deaths. They all deserved to have long, happy lives. One left behind a child and a young wife, but the others never even got the chance for that.

The ones who came home and were greeted with riots, anti-war protests, and worse, certainly didn't deserve what they got either. But at least they came home. I'm grateful that the young men fighting in our recent conflicts at least have come home to the thanks and gratitude of their country.

So on this Memorial Day, spend some time giving thanks for the many blessings we all have, for the great liberties we enjoy and the beauty of this country we call home. Despite our flaws, there's no better place on earth. The second verse of the hymn I sang in church this morning brought it all home for me.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>America! America! God mend thine every flaw, Confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite our shortcomings, we can persevere and become ever better, ever more accepting and ever more loving.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And especially remember all the young soldiers who served and died to make it so.</p>

I've been traveling, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, to see relatives. I've been busy with volunteer activities, family things, life in general. No particularly good excuses, just haven't posted.

But I've been following a discussion on a Facebook page the past few days, about young men, boys really, with whom I went to high school who died early in Vietnam.

It's always been hard for me to understand the war in Vietnam even though I grew up and went to high school and college during that time. I guess I was just sort of clueless, but it wasn't until the shootings at Kent State, just shortly before I graduated college, that it really hit home. People were dying! Those kids could have been me! I could have been shot just for doing a "college kid" type of thing.

But there were several guys I knew, Jay Sacks and Johnny Luebke in my high school class, and a couple who were older, who died over there. That put dying young, loss, family grief all into perspective for me, a sheltered, fortunate, kid. I'm not sure if I have still come to terms with their early deaths.

For me, this particular day is that day; the day everything changed.

It started out like any other day. I went to work about 9:00, bringing my son along because he was having asthma problems and we had a doctor's appointment in the afternoon. This was easy to do because my husband and I owned a furniture store and we could make whatever child care arrangements we needed on any particular day - one of the perks of entrepreneurship.

About 10:30, my sister called and asked if I had heard from Mom that our Dad was in the hospital with some type of heart problem. I had not. I don't remember the total progression of things from there, but I remember speaking to my mother and asking if I should come to Florida where they lived. She said no, wait til Dad is feeling better. Then he will enjoy your visit.

Shortly after lunch, I decided to go to the new travel agent in our little town, and see if she could get me a ticket to Florida. This was over twenty years ago, so there was no internet to search. Also by that point, I was worried, and needed to have someone take care of this for me. This amazing woman, who had just opened her office, and left about a year later, argued with the airlines, got me an emergency fare, and I went back to work with a ticket for 4:00 pm. (Always feel like this was a case of an angel being there for me just when I needed one.)

I then tried to find my mother at the hospital to let her know what I was doing. I couldn't locate her in the waiting areas and couldn't get much information about her or my dad or their whereabouts. I finally remembered the name of the hospital administrator that Mom and Dad knew and asked for his extension. Mom was in his office and that's when she told me he was gone.

I remember crying out and throwing the phone at the wall. My son and husband rushed into my office to see what was happening...and they knew.

A couple of hours later, I was sitting on a plane, watching all the "old" people getting on the flight to Florida, some in wheelchairs, with canes and oxygen tanks, looking haggard and unkempt.  I was absolutely furious that my father, who was seemingly healthy, only 64, and who looked so much better than the old men getting on the plane, was dead and these walking corpses were not.

Some friends of my parents met my plane and took me to Mom's house. My sister had come earlier and had gone to the hospital thinking our dad was alive, only to be told he was not. My brother and other sister arrived a day or so later. Other family came, husbands, kids, cousins, aunt and uncle, good friends. What a blessing to have other people around who loved Dad and were as heartbroken as we were.

The years since then have been up and down as years always are. My children have married and I have a grandchild. My Mom now has 9 grandchildren, 2 more than when my dad died. There are 4 great-grandchildren. Our business was successful for twenty years, in large part because of the lessons in finance and business that we learned from Dad.  When we chose to retire, we continued the type of planning and organizing he encouraged and are navigating our retirement gracefully.

But rarely does a day go by, even after 24 years, that I don't wonder what Dad would think about something, remember the ways he thought certain things should be done, and remember, mainly, what a good, kind and caring man he was. He loved all of us unreservedly and encouraged us to always reach for the stars and be the best we could be. He loved spending time up north and gave us the great gift of a summer cabin that we all enjoyed throughout my childhood, and that we still enjoy to this day. I remember his great religious faith and the example he set for us to be faithful to God and to our family before anything else.

And I just miss his big belly laugh, his big smile, and his joy in living. The last glimpse I had of him, a week before he died, was as he drove away from our store and he waved out the window of his blue van as he headed south.

Life has never been the same since.

Everyone knows you can't get to grandchildren without having kids of your own, and we also know that none of us has the time to appreciate all the special little achievements that our own children complete on a regular basis.

But now, with the time to sit back, watch, and enjoy every second of his visits with me, I have realized that  he is already a very smart little boy and I can learn a lot from him. Learning life skills seems to start early. So here's what he is teaching me.
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Persevere - Never, ever give up on trying to get what you want. If you really want Grandma to get down Grandpa's model tractor so you can play with it, keep finding a different way to get up the stairs to Grandpa's office. Go through the dining room, go down the hallway, just move faster than Grandma and you will probably get there.</span></li>
	<li>Acquiesce with good grace when thwarted.... and then just look for another way to get what you want. Smile at Grandma and pretend you have given up. And then, when she is distracted, go after that tractor again!! You know - if at first you don't succeed??</li>
	<li>Work Hard - Try to lift heavy things, help Mom with groceries, making dinner, vacuuming, and picking up the toys. If you do the hard work in life early and often, it will seem easy when you get older. Or maybe as a teen you will decide you have worked hard enough already and become a slacker/whiner! (Grandma will love you anyway!)</li>
	<li>Have Fun - Run around in circles, laugh hysterically when you roll on the floor, get everybody around you to play with your toys, smile at strangers, jump in the leaves, slide down the hill in the snow, splash in the shower, dance to the music---just make every moment count and make it fun.</li>
	<li>Love Everyone - Give Grandma, Grandpa, Mom, Dad big kisses and hugs, cuddle your stuffed toys, chase the cat so you can snuggle him, name all the special people in your life that are pictured on your refrigerator. The best part is they will love you back and that leads back to having fun, getting what you want, etc, etc.</li>
	<li>Treasure Your Friendships - Share your toys with friends, be nice to the babies, and never kiss and tell. When asked if his special friend, Clare, is his girlfriend, Cody just smiles and looks coyly away.</li>
	<li>Love the Outdoors - Observe everything you see outside, like the ants crawling on acorns, the wind blowing the leaves around, the worms Grandpa dug up in the garden, the footprints in the snow, a big hawk soaring out of the tree in your backyard, the sun, the moon, the stars and the clouds. It's all amazing and awe-inspiring and there's no better way to learn about the hand of God in all of creation.</li>
	<li>Always, always wear a hat! A good hat is a man's best friend...and very cool.</li>
</ol>
And when you come to the end of the day, you can enjoy a good night's sleep, knowing that you can get up in the morning and enjoy all the wonders of a new day all over again. It would be great if we could always remember to love life like a two-year-old!

Everyone knows you can't get to grandchildren without having kids of your own, and we also know that none of us has the time to appreciate all the special little achievements that our own children complete on a regular basis.

But now, with the time to sit back, watch, and enjoy every second of his visits with me, I have realized that  he is already a very smart little boy and I can learn a lot from him. Learning life skills seems to start early. So here's what he is teaching me.
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Persevere - Never, ever give up on trying to get what you want. If you really want Grandma to get down Grandpa's model tractor so you can play with it, keep finding a different way to get up the stairs to Grandpa's office. Go through the dining room, go down the hallway, just move faster than Grandma and you will probably get there.</span></li>
	<li>Acquiesce with good grace when thwarted.... and then just look for another way to get what you want. Smile at Grandma and pretend you have given up. And then, when she is distracted, go after that tractor again!! You know - if at first you don't succeed??</li>
	<li>Work Hard - Try to lift heavy things, help Mom with groceries, making dinner, vacuuming, and picking up the toys. If you do the hard work in life early and often, it will seem easy when you get older. Or maybe as a teen you will decide you have worked hard enough already and become a slacker/whiner! (Grandma will love you anyway!)</li>
	<li>Have Fun - Run around in circles, laugh hysterically when you roll on the floor, get everybody around you to play with your toys, smile at strangers, jump in the leaves, slide down the hill in the snow, splash in the shower, dance to the music---just make every moment count and make it fun.</li>
	<li>Love Everyone - Give Grandma, Grandpa, Mom, Dad big kisses and hugs, cuddle your stuffed toys, chase the cat so you can snuggle him, name all the special people in your life that are pictured on your refrigerator. The best part is they will love you back and that leads back to having fun, getting what you want, etc, etc.</li>
	<li>Treasure Your Friendships - Share your toys with friends, be nice to the babies, and never kiss and tell. When asked if his special friend, Clare, is his girlfriend, Cody just smiles and looks coyly away.</li>
	<li>Love the Outdoors - Observe everything you see outside, like the ants crawling on acorns, the wind blowing the leaves around, the worms Grandpa dug up in the garden, the footprints in the snow, a big hawk soaring out of the tree in your backyard, the sun, the moon, the stars and the clouds. It's all amazing and awe-inspiring and there's no better way to learn about the hand of God in all of creation.</li>
	<li>Always, always wear a hat! A good hat is a man's best friend...and very cool.</li>
</ol>
And when you come to the end of the day, you can enjoy a good night's sleep, knowing that you can get up in the morning and enjoy all the wonders of a new day all over again. It would be great if we could always remember to love life like a two-year-old!

But it didn't take more than a couple of sentences and I was totally lost and had no idea what the company was supposed to do or how it was supposed to do it.

And then it came to me. I really didn't care! I always thought it would be "good for me" to struggle with the jargon and do my best to understand all the techy details, because then I would not succumb to old age and stop learning new things. I would be able to make informed decisions about which laptop was best for me, whether I needed a Nook or a Kindle, or how to fix my desktop when it locked up, or refused to make any Windows updates (literally spent MONTHS on that!!)

But here's the deal.  I still have soooo many things to learn about life, people, relationships, my God, my family, my friends, how to grow blue hydrangeas, ---well, you get the picture, ---that I really don't have to pretend I understand or even care about all that technical stuff ! We all have only so much time in this world, and I realize I have better things to do than understand the differences between Windows RT and Windows 8.1.

There are just too many details these days. No one can keep them straight in their mind, so my new philosophy is to not even bother to try. If I really need to know something, I can google it, ask someone I know, take a class, or consciously make a choice to not give a rap.

Instead I will spend my time enjoying the beauty of the outdoor world, cultivating the old and new friendships I have so graciously been given, reading good books, travel near and far, and just de-stress and enjoy each day I have.

Whew! I already feel better just making that choice. How liberating!!

Learning new things about the world is one of the ways that  people stay young or young at heart.

So I thought about some new things I learned this year. Nothing real earth-shattering, but still, it's something new. Each item on my list made me consider things differently than I had previously. Maybe you knew all this stuff, but I didn't.  Here goes.
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2015/01/Hybrid-Detasselers1-LG.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-866" alt="Hybrid-Detasselers1-LG" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2015/01/Hybrid-Detasselers1-LG-300x131.jpg" width="250" height="170" /></a>When I was a teenager, my cousins detassled corn. Detassling is removing the silk off one row of corn stalks so the corn is properly pollinated and produces full, ripe ears of corn. There wasn't much corn growing where I lived, so I thought this sounded like a very glamorous and exciting thing to do when I was 14. It's not! It's hard, sweaty, dirty, allergy-inducing work in the hot sun. It had to be done by hand and, I assume, it still does. But a cousin-in-law, who ran a detassling crew back in the day, told me this summer that only corn being grown to be seed corn needed to be detassled. Regular field corn was not detassled. That explains why I never saw anyone actually riding a tractor or a wagon around a corn field pulling off silk. There apparently wasn't much seed corn being grown anywhere around my west suburban town.</li>
	<li>I love watching the eagles soar high above the lake I visit in Northern Wisconsin. When I was a child there, we never saw eagles. They have made an amazing comeback in the US, and now can be seen all over the upper Midwest. They are very distinctive from other birds because of their black bodies with white heads and tail feathers - very easy to identify from the ground. BUT---immature eagles, up to about three years, are all black. They are also not quite as large as the mature eagles, but I'm also not as quick to dismiss a soaring black bird as just another crow.<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2015/01/DSCN7266-Locks-on-river-.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-872" alt="DSCN7266 Locks on river" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2015/01/DSCN7266-Locks-on-river--300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></li>
	<li>Watching eagles led me to another discovery. The northern parts of the Mississippi River can freeze solid in the winter and boat traffic stops. There may be some open water around some of the dams or locks on the river and you can find lots of eagles congregating there in January, February and March. I always thought the river just had barges going up and down all year long. I suppose south of St. Louis or so this may be true, but not in the north.</li>
	<li>My son is building a new house and the land was a soy bean field before construction started. I never spent any time in a soybean field and had no idea what soybeans looked like up close. I am also not an edamame fan (which I guess is some other variety of soybean), so that didn't help either. The big discovery was that soybeans grow in pods just like other beans, peas or legumes. They also kept my grandson occupied one afternoon, digging dried soybeans up with a stick in his someday back yard.</li>
	<li>Alligators can be found in all the southern Gulf Coast states. They are fun to see if you're not in the water with one! I know that southern Illinois has cypress swamps and I wondered if alligators could be found that far north. Fortunately, they can only be found as far north as southern North Carolina. But don't be complacent! With global warming and climate change, they could be slowly moving north!</li>
	<li><img class="size-full wp-image-873 alignleft" alt="download" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/everybody-has-a-story/files/2015/01/download.jpg" width="259" height="194" />And finally, another natural thing I learned. It's fun to see geese flying in the typical V formation as they migrate or just move from one pond to another. But geese are really smarter than they look. When the geese are flying long distances, they take turns taking the lead position in their formation. When the leader tires, he drops back and lets another bird take over. That's why they can fly such long distances almost non-stop. I think that's what good friends or families are for - when you really tire out, hopefully one of them jumps in front and you can fall back for awhile.</li>
</ol>
So that's it - just a few things I learned this year. I'll never learn most of the things that are interesting, exciting, thought-provoking or just plain goofy in this world. But it's always a good day for me when something makes me say, "I never knew that before!"

I think that's what good friends or families are for - when you really tire out, hopefully one of them jumps in front and you can fall back for awhile.</li>
</ol>
So that's it - just a few things I learned this year. I'll never learn most of the things that are interesting, exciting, thought-provoking or just plain goofy in this world. But it's always a good day for me when something makes me say, "I never knew that before!"

My dad bought this cabin in 1959 after we had spent several summers at a resort next door. It was just a little hunting shack with an outhouse, a resident mouse who stole our cookies every night unless we had them sealed away, and a wood stove to keep us warm on chilly summer nights. Eventually my dad built a larger house, but for 6 or 7 years, our little cabin (with indoor plumbing added), was our home away from home in the summer.

But it really wasn't the cabin itself that mattered. It was all the amazing things we could do all day long outdoors. First, of course, was time in the water. We went swimming, wading for minnows, and later, lots and lots of water skiing, boating and even a little fishing.

My brother, sister and I played a game that had no name with a small outboard fishing boat. We took turns driving the boat, and one of the other two sat in the bow of the boat and dropped a chunk of two-by-four over the side. The object was to see who could spot when the wood was dropped the fastest, and then turn the boat around and pick it up in one pass. If you had to go back around for a second pass, you lost. That was a great game when it was too cold to swim.

It seems that summers in the northwoods were much cooler than they are these days. Old pictures often show us in sweatshirts and long pants. The nights could be quite chilly and the wood stove and a warm blanket were essential. Campfires were always fun, especially when there were marshmallows to roast. Mosquitoes were always present, but never much fun. While it seems to be warmer in the summer now, (a few years back it got up to 100 degrees!)the mosquitoes are still not much fun.

We had some very good family friends who usually spent part of the summer in another cabin nearby. Because our parents were good friends, they usually didn't pay a whole lot of attention to what we kids were up to. So the six of us generally had the run of the woods, collecting drift wood, "rare" stones, crayfish and other treasures. The dads were always good for driving the boats when we water skied, usually for hours and hours, or for as long as the gas in the boat held out. We skied alone, we skied in twos or even threes. Friend John grabbed my tow line once and kept cutting in front of me until he finally made me fall. Not sure if I have ever forgiven him for that.

We did a little fishing, but the dads weren't really too much into that. Sometimes we caught perch or crappies between the floor boards on the pier. Once I caught a good size fish in the boat and my dad held it up for the family in the other boat to see - and dropped it into the lake! When we got older, my brother and sister and I went out fishing alone and sometimes caught something decent. Mostly, it was just about being out on the water.

Our lake is part of a chain of 27 lakes that you can traverse from one end to the other. So we would load up the two boats, my family's and our friends boat, and take the whole day to go through most of the lakes, get lifted over the road to the lower chain of lakes, and go all the way to Eagle River. After a picnic lunch, we would go all the way back home. One year it didn't go quite like that. Our friend's boat had a mechanical failure of some type. We had to leave it on the other side of the chain, and all ten of us rode back to our lake in one seriously overloaded boat. We had to go fairly slowly as the boat wallowed through the water and wouldn't really plane properly, but we did eventually get safely home.

There are hundreds of other adventures and memories from my childhood years at the lake, but as the years have gone by, we now are making memories with our children and their children. My siblings have gathered several times with their families, growing to their children's spouses and then to grandkids. We pack into the larger house with more room, but we still end up with bodies sleeping all over the place.

But the fun is always the same: lots of time in the water, lots of time ON the water, lots of good food, lots of silliness, lots of family, lots of reminiscing. It's still my favorite place in the whole world and I can't imagine anything ever changing that.
