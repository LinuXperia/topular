  <p>Bad Hunter is slated to open in June next to Au Cheval.</p> <p>More than two years after&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/oon-restaurant">OON</a> <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2013/12/21/6309079/less-than-six-months-in-oon-is-done">suddenly shuttered</a> after six months in, the prominent Randolph Row space is preparing to welcome a new restaurant—from the stalwart group that brought Chicago <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/the-trenchermen" class="sbn-auto-link">Trenchermen</a>, <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/sportsman" class="sbn-auto-link">Sportsman's Club</a> and <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/pub-royale" class="sbn-auto-link">Pub Royale</a>. Heisler Hospitality is revealing plans today for a veggie-centric eatery at 802 W. Randolph Street named <b>Bad Hunter</b>, which is&nbsp;projected for a June opening.</p>
<p>While the name fits nicely next to Heisler's bar next door, <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/lone-wolf" class="sbn-auto-link">Lone Wolf</a>, it's based on the idea that "a bad hunter would likely find himself eating more vegetables than protein," reps say. The concept gives Restaurant Row a type of cuisine it's lacking and a contrast to burger bonanza <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/au-cheval" class="sbn-auto-link">Au Cheval</a> on the other side of the space.</p>
<p>Chef <b>Dan Snowden</b>, who was an&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2012/6/5/6580307/meet-the-eater-young-guns-final-50">Eater Young Gun finalist in 2012 </a>when he worked at <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/the-publican" class="sbn-auto-link">The Publican</a>, is planning seasonal dishes centered around vegetables (though there will be meat too) using a wood grill as the main cooking tool. Company beverage manager Michael McAvena, known for his work at Pub Royale, will handle the wine program, while Josh Fossitt, who has experience at Heisler cocktail bar <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/queen-mary" class="sbn-auto-link">Queen Mary</a> and NYC's acclaimed NoMad, is working on moderately-low alcohol cocktails.</p>
<p>Company designer Kevin Heisner is aiming to give the space an "English garden feel," including such features as paved brick on the floor and lots of greenery. Expect 65 seats in the dining area, a full bar, and an events space on the second floor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.badhunter.com/" style="line-height: 1.24;">Bad Hunter</a> is the latest in a string of acclaimed projects for Heisler, and a&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2015/1/20/7860439/logan-square-marks-heisler-hospitalitys-next-project">Logan Square bar</a> is in the works as well. Stay tuned for more details.</p>

  <p>When Bon Appétit looks for "Brooklyn" in Indianapolis, it finds some controversy.</p> <p>In the March issue of <i>Bon Appétit</i>, also dubbed as its "Culture" issue, editors lay out 21 elements that define cool in the culinary industry, from fried chicken sandwiches to marijuana edibles. The final entry is a two-page article by John Birdsall entitled "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/brooklyn-is-everywhere">How Every City Became Brooklyn</a>." It offers the notion that "Brooklyn" now exemplifies a phenomenon of "food codes" (artisanal pickles, throwback cocktails, pour-over coffee, etc.) which will fast track a city to its maximum potential. The article&nbsp;<span>uses Indianapolis—via James Beard Award nominee </span><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Jonathan Brooks of Milktooth</b><span>—as its case study.</span></p>
<p>"I tell Brooks how I'm in Indianapolis to find Brooklyn, and to see how America's dominant food trends play out in a place with an emerging restaurant scene," Birdsall writes. "I see his face drop, like I've delivered the ultimate insult, regarding these young chefs as cartoon characters."</p>
<p><q class="pullquote float-right">"I get it, I understand why buzzwords and shit like that sell magazines and get people to read articles, but Brooklyn doesn't have anything to do with Indianapolis."</q></p>
<p>Here in Chicago, we know the feeling: We're all too familiar with the comparison to our East Coast counterpart. So much so that the term "Second City," originally coined during the battle with New York City to host the World Columbian Exposition, leaves a sour taste when it comes to describing the culinary scene. But why, as evident by the article, is the Midwest seemingly trapped in New York City's shadow—€”constantly measured against the metropolis's yardstick? Why did&nbsp;<i>Bon Appétit</i> send a California-based writer to Indianapolis to equate its punk-rock music hall, persimmon-topped biscuits, and pork belly sandwiches to another night in Williamsburg?&nbsp;<span>A lot of Midwestern chefs have an opinion on that.</span></p>
<p>"I get it, I understand why buzzwords and shit like that sell magazines and get people to read articles," Brooks says to Eater. "But Brooklyn doesn't have anything to do with Indianapolis."</p>
<p>Brooks is an Indianapolis native who put in time at restaurants in Chicago before returning back to his hometown to open a brunch-only restaurant that was named one of <i>Bon Appétit's</i> 10 Best New Restaurants of 2015. "That sort of migration helps explain why things that once defined Brooklyn—€”pottery studios, mead distilleries, or millennials selling their crafts—€”have turned up all over," Birdsall writes in&nbsp;<i>Bon Appétit</i><span>. "Folks like Brooks read about them online, or got into them while traveling or while living in Brooklyn proper, then decided there was no reason their hometowns shouldn't have them too."</span></p>
<p>However, many would argue the craft movement is nothing new outside of Brooklyn. In fact, when Eater asked several Midwestern chefs what traits define their respective city's food culture, a long-standing commitment to locally made goods surfaced as a recurring characteristic. "When people in Brooklyn or wherever started making cheese or pickling or canning stuff or making leather goods, it was a new thing for everybody in New York, but here in the Midwest and the South too, people never stopped doing that stuff," said Scott Worsham, owner of&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/tags/mfk">mfk</a>.&nbsp;"Chicago still has a leather tannery factory right in the middle of it." Is the city guilty of jumping onto the ramen bandwagon two years after Ippudo opened its second location? Yes, but "locally made" has been happening for centuries.</p>
<p><q class="pullquote float-left">"I find it frustrating that something good in St. Louis—something unique or cool—is instantly equated to somewhere else."</q></p>
<p>The sentiment is echoed throughout the region. "I find it frustrating that something good in St. Louis—something unique or cool—is instantly equated to somewhere else," Mike Randolph, chef and owner of Público in St. Louis, told Eater. "'That's a very Brooklyn experience.' Was it?  I certainly agree there are parts of St. Louis that have the general vibe of say a Portland or Brooklyn. But what we do have, and what I love about it here, is this notion that no one is too cool for school. We all enjoy a good drink, a good meal, and our city's diverse culture. We are the Midwest and we embrace it."</p>
<p>In its quest to find "Brooklyn," the magazine misses what makes the Midwest a culinary epicenter, says chef <b>John Vermiglio</b>. "Take me, in Detroit, within 30 minutes, I can be on countless farms around the area, and that's just not possible when you live deep in the boroughs of New York," says Vermiglio, a former Chicago chef who recently returned to Detroit to open&nbsp;<a href="http://detroit.eater.com/tags/grey-ghost">Grey Ghost</a>. "I know there's local there, and I know there's urban initiatives and things like that happening, but that connection to the farmer—inevitably, you need land for that, and the Midwest is busting with it at this point. Who knows who started the farm-to-table thing, but there's no denying that during the growing season, the Midwest is at the forefront of it."</p>
<p>"I think the most fucked up thing about the article is the comparison of the so-called small towns to Brooklyn, when it should go the other way," says <b>Brandon Baltzley</b>, a southern-born chef who cooked in Chicago, Indiana, New York City, and Boston before recently opening&nbsp;<a href="http://boston.eater.com/tags/the-41--70">the 41-70</a> in Cape Cod. "Brooklyn's food culture made its name off of biting other cultures and trends, and being lucky enough to be so heavily populated that anything kind of goes. Places like Indy; Portland, Maine; St. Louis; and Charleston, those are the places that have unique voices. They do the work and labor of fishing and farming, and have a deep sense of self."</p>
<p><q class="pullquote float-right">"Who knows who started the farm-to-table thing, but there's no denying that during the growing season, the Midwest is at the forefront of it."</q></p>
<p>At the end of the article, there's a question: "What if it isn't so much Indianapolis trying to be Brooklyn, as Brooklyn wanting to capture something of Indianapolis?" But the comparison alone cheapens each city's character. Brooklyn is a melting pot of cultures. Indianapolis, according to <b>Spoke &amp; Steele's executive chef Tyson Peterson</b>, is a city where "the palate is evolving. Everyone has a misconception that it's just pork and corn or meat and potatoes out here, but there's such room for creativity out here because we're in the shadow, and we have the financial opportunity to open these mom-and-pop restaurants."</p>
<p><span>The fact remains that elements of almost every blossoming city's identity, somehow, become magnetically connected to the idea of "Brooklyn." But articles like these push forward the notion that everyone else is copying the trendy borough, and not vice versa. They ignore the possibility of a more complex cultural shift built on far more than trend chasing. There's no arguing they sell magazines. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>So, if Indianapolis is not Brooklyn and Chicago is not Manhattan and Detroit is busy building restaurants in abandoned auto shops, what is the Midwest's culinary identity? Leave your thoughts below.</span></p>

  <p>Rock 'n Roll Noodle Co. is graduating from the farmers market scene to brick and mortar next month.</p> <p>Over the last seven years, <b>Rock 'n Roll Noodle Co</b>. has developed a following, slinging Thai food at Chicago's farmers markets and at music festivals including Lollapalooza and Riot Fest. Now owner Anna Abbey is preparing to open her first brick and mortar restaurant next month—<b>Rock 'n Roll Noodle's Mad Love</b>. Abbey, whose parents opened one of Chicago's first Thai restaurants in the 1970s, promises her space will offer something no other Thai restaurant can offer.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been to a Thai restaurant that spins vinyl and plays Motown and Old Soul?" Abbey said.</p>
<p>Abbey's opening up a small spot with room for about 30 people at 1810 W. Montrose Ave. in mid-March in Ravenswood. They've&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2060502592/rock-n-roll-noodles-mad-love?ref=users" target="_blank">launched a Kickstarter</a>, which ends on Tuesday with a modest goal of raising $6,000, but Mad Love will open regardless. In the 1970s, Abbey's Thai immigrant parents opened and ran The Thai Room on Western Avenue, where she learned much from her older generations. She hopes to harness that immigrant work ethic and spirit to create a restaurant with authentic flavors.</p>
<p>"You can expect some really super traditional flavors and preparation, being that's my background," she said. "But at the same time, I'm American and I love American comfort foods."</p>
<p>For example, Abbey described a dish that mixes Massaman curry with mashed potatoes—her version of mashed potatoes and gravy. Abbey also wants to offer Thai breakfast in the future.</p>
<p>Mixing music and food is ideal for Abbey, and she promises a warm environment that blends her love for Western songs with her Thai heritage. They've had the space near for almost a year, as<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2015/5/22/8645649/plywood-report-tenant-for-vacant-boston-market" target="_blank"> they announced </a>the restaurant in May. She also wants to team up with a charity and help impoverished teens by offering them meals. After all, she is calling her restaurant "Mad Love."</p>

  <p>Updated for 2016, this list won't let weather affect Chicago's party habits. </p> <p>Chicago's weather may not always be suitable for al fresco dining and drinking, but Chicagoans are crafty and know that there are ways to escape Mother Nature. Check out these establishments with sliding roofs and other structures that shelter guests from the elements while also allowing fresh air above when the weather permits. Be sure to check ahead, however, as not all of them are open year-round.</p>
<p>For this year, four new spots were added. They include Fremont, which opened late in 2015; and Tanta, which added a canvas roof last year.</p>

  <p>A European concept is coming to North Avenue in Wicker Park.</p> <p>The <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/birchwood-kitchen"><b>Birchwood Kitchen</b></a> space won't remain vacant for long. The Wicker Park restaurant's space, known for its charming interior, quaint patio and standout brunch before&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2015/10/6/9461229/birchwood-kitchen-closing-wicker-park">shuttering last October</a> at 2211 W. North Ave., will be reborn this spring with a new concept from two restaurant vets: <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/winchester">The Winchester</a> owner <b>Chris Pappas</b> and pastry chef <b>Nancy Silver</b>.</p>
<p><span>The two met in 2001, when they not only both worked at Terry Alexander concepts (MOD and Soul Kitchen, respectively), but also lived across the hall from each other. They're reuniting to open an all-day European-inspired restaurant that will offer the best of both Silver's pastries and Pappas' wine expertise.</span></p>
<p>"Chris and I have been friends for a long time and I think we have different strengths, so it seemed like a great opportunity to do something with him," Silver says. "Chris and I both lived and worked in that neighborhood for many years, so it feels like a homecoming to me."</p>
<p>Silver brings over 15 years of pastry experience, including time at Firefly in Los Angeles and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/blackbird">Blackbird</a> back home, as well as a panache for ice cream making (she owned Snookelfritz, a small-batch company that sold gourmet ice cream at <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/green-city-market">Green City Market</a>). Pappas has equal wine knowledge, overseeing programs at Telegraph, Bluebird, and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/sepia">Sepia</a> before opening The Winchester 2014.</p>

  <p>Details are scarce, but they plan on opening later this year.</p> <p><a href="http://chicago.eater.com/venue/sepia?_ga=1.168080932.469300513.1392538116"><b>Sepia</b></a> owner Emmanuel Nony and chef Andrew Zimmerman hope the new restaurant they plan on opening at the end of the year provides a bold, more casual departure from the fine-dining experience that made the original a Michelin-starred restaurant. They won't divulge the name or location of the new spot, but Nony says it will be within a two-mile radius of Sepia, allowing Zimmerman and Sepia's crew to easily float between both locations.</p>
<p>The two spoke about how guests sometimes have preconceptions about fine-dining restaurants, and how their new and unnamed spot would challenge palettes and expectations. There's also a lower price point, and for example, the most-expensive bottle of wine at Sepia clocks in about $500. Nony said they're targeting a high-mark of $100 at the new restaurant.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of really interesting food we want to explore that doesn't necessarily fit into the fine-dining paradigm," Zimmerman said. "There's a lot of things we want to share with the Chicago dining public. It's not about being bored with Sepia, it's really about exploring."</p>
<p>Zimmerman, a Beard Foundation Award semifinalist nominee for Best Chef: Great Lakes, will be joined by Sepia beverage director Arthur Hon, who helped net Sepia's other Beard semifinalist nomination for Outstanding Wine Program. Sepia pastry chef Cindy Schuman will also join the team at the new restaurant. Eventually they'll bring on new team members, as the influx of new blood will further help differentiate the new concept, Zimmerman said.</p>
<p>What about that new identity? For example, the new restaurant will serve some menu items that diners will be encouraged to use their hands to eat. But that playfulness won't be indicative of the entire menu: "I can confirm we won't be opening up a barbecue joint," Zimmerman said.</p>
<p>Sepia celebrates its ninth birthday this year and Private Dining by Sepia turns five, which means "the timing is right for the team." Nony said they've been contemplating opening a second restaurant for years. Sepia&nbsp;<a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2015/10/27/9620340/michelin-stars-chicago-2016" target="_blank">earned a Michelin star </a>this year, and has earned the recognition every year since 2011.</p>
