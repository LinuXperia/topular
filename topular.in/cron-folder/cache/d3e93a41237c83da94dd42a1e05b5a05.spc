It has an effect on how long we work and what types of positions we seek out. As a result, I sought out the expertise of Alan Adducci. This will benefit people at all stages of their career or background.

<b>Why are those just starting their careers, hesitant to start investing, for retirement?</b>

I find that many people do not have information they need to make those decisions.   We may not learn this is school.  And if you not learn it from your family, you have seek out the information.

The effect of compounding returns has the most dramatic effect, the earlier you start investing.  And the younger you start investment, the more this will work for you!

For example, consider an example, two twin brothers, Sam and Ben, both age 23 and both starting their career, both earning same salary, $50,000, with the same annual raises, 3.72%, and investing in the same investment averaging a hypothetical 8% per year increase.

Sam starts investing his first check, saving 5% of his salary, into his 401(k) Plan, with the company contributing a match of another 3%.

Fast forward to age 68, Sam accumulated, $2,674,696.

Ben was not sure what to do, he had other bills, priorities, etc., and waited 10 years later to start investing, then diligently saved the same % amount, with same match amount, until he was also 68.

Ben will have $1,612,983 in his 401(k) at age 68.

So those lost first 10 years, of investing, or a total of $29,628 of his contribution not invested, during those first 10 years, cost Ben $761,713 in potential future savings.   Ben will have 72% of the balance he could have accumulated, if he started from his first day working.

Why?

COMPOUND GAINS - when the gain you make on your investment, gets compounded by MORE gain, the results can be dramatic.  However, this takes years to happen, and the longer you invest, the better this works.

But in real life, the effect gets magnified even more.   Those who save early, like Sam, develop the saving habit, and it feels great!    They see their saving grow.  They may be more likely to live within their earnings.  They may be more likely to arrange their life style, in the future, to allow investing a big portion of their raises, and bonuses, resulting in the potential for increased savings.

Those like Ben, who wait, may never learn this, and just the opposite may likely happen.  They may likely live paycheck to paycheck, their entire life, always living slightly over their income and never experience financial confidence

<i>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.”</i>

<i>Albert Einstein</i><i></i>

<i>1879-1955</i>

<b>When is an appropriate time for a working professional to start investing for retirement?</b>

As early as possible!

First paycheck!

Often someone working also is building an emergency fund, or paying off student loans, etc.    So even if they cannot save as much as they would like at the beginning, starting early, with the inner commitment to increase the saving annually, is prudent for most employees.

<b>Is it ever too late to start investing, for retirement?</b>

It is never too late to start!

Very important to determine what you have learned from the past.

I have seen individuals and couples make dramatic changes in a short time period!

It is important to accept any errors made in the past, as a learning experience for the future, and concentrate on only those things you can control.

<strong>When did your book officially hit the market?</strong>
<div>My book officially hit the market Sept. 7th 2013.</div>
<strong>What reception have you received so far?</strong>

The reception so far has been outstanding! I have been able to help many people, particularly young adults, understand what it really means to find their path and live with purpose. Besides the outpouring of support from family and friends, I have had youth groups and educators purchase my book as a way of better understanding how to teach our young people about success and achievement. The most recent acknowledgement was a letter from President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama thanking me for sharing the book with them.

<strong>How would you describe the publishing experience?</strong>

The publishing experience was tedious. There are so many aspects to consider, such as: pricing, budgets, sales and marketing, discounts, wholesalers, copyright, and the book identification process, etc. I have definitely learned quite a bit about this industry. I also understand why it's so challenging to break into this field. But, I love a challenge! Plus, I know the merits of my book and the impact it has had, so I'm confident that doors will open. In fact, there have been numerous opportunities that have come my way already. Although the process has been tedious, I am very grateful for the opportunities that I have experienced thus far.

<strong>What projects are you in the middle of?</strong>
<div>Right now, the major project that I am working on is Empowered People Mentoring Group (EPMG). This is a mentoring group for young adults ages 11-19. After "How to Become Influential and Highly Successful" was written, I created a workbook to coincide with the original text. The workbook serves as the curriculum for the mentoring group. I am very excited about working with young people and mentoring is a passion of mine. I believe it's important to give back to the community and provide a blueprint for subsequent generations to follow. Mentoring allows me to fulfill both of these beliefs. It is truly a rewarding experience!</div>
<strong>When can we expect to see more of your work hit the market?</strong>

My workbook is the second publication that Empowered People Press will release. It will appear on the market in just a few days from now. I am also working on a third book that will explore my experiences as educator teaching African American youth. I will continue to aggressively promote all of my books through various channels and seek partnerships with like-minded individuals or corporations.

<strong>Do you have any closing words?</strong>
<div>In closing, I'd like to thank all of the people who work to empower our young people every day. Whether as an educator, social worker, youth organization, youth ministry, mentoring group, or after school program, I sincerely thank you for your efforts. Developing relationships with our young people is hard work and sometimes the people who are working the closest with them do not earn recognition for their efforts. So, I want to say thank you to all of you.

The most recent acknowledgement was a letter from President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama thanking me for sharing the book with them.

<strong>How would you describe the publishing experience?</strong>

The publishing experience was tedious. There are so many aspects to consider, such as: pricing, budgets, sales and marketing, discounts, wholesalers, copyright, and the book identification process, etc. I have definitely learned quite a bit about this industry. I also understand why it's so challenging to break into this field. But, I love a challenge! Plus, I know the merits of my book and the impact it has had, so I'm confident that doors will open. In fact, there have been numerous opportunities that have come my way already. Although the process has been tedious, I am very grateful for the opportunities that I have experienced thus far.

<strong>What projects are you in the middle of?</strong>
<div>Right now, the major project that I am working on is Empowered People Mentoring Group (EPMG). This is a mentoring group for young adults ages 11-19. After "How to Become Influential and Highly Successful" was written, I created a workbook to coincide with the original text. The workbook serves as the curriculum for the mentoring group. I am very excited about working with young people and mentoring is a passion of mine. I believe it's important to give back to the community and provide a blueprint for subsequent generations to follow. Mentoring allows me to fulfill both of these beliefs. It is truly a rewarding experience!</div>
<strong>When can we expect to see more of your work hit the market?</strong>

My workbook is the second publication that Empowered People Press will release. It will appear on the market in just a few days from now. I am also working on a third book that will explore my experiences as educator teaching African American youth. I will continue to aggressively promote all of my books through various channels and seek partnerships with like-minded individuals or corporations.

<strong>Do you have any closing words?</strong>
<div>In closing, I'd like to thank all of the people who work to empower our young people every day. Whether as an educator, social worker, youth organization, youth ministry, mentoring group, or after school program, I sincerely thank you for your efforts. Developing relationships with our young people is hard work and sometimes the people who are working the closest with them do not earn recognition for their efforts. So, I want to say thank you to all of you.

We speak to our employees, we speak to our bosses or owners, we speak to our contractors, and we speak to our present and future clients. Sometimes we're able to prepare for our speaking, other times it happens spur of the moment. One of the best things that you can do to ensure that your speaking is high quality in almost any situation is to have a signature speech.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/2013/07/the-immense-importance-of-having-a-signature-speech/lecture/" rel="attachment wp-att-565"><img alt="lecture" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/files/2013/07/speeches-px1hai.jpg" width="347" height="346" /></a>

What is a go-to speech? A go-to speech is a talk that you know backwards and forwards. More times than not it is about your life and your experiences and it paints you to be as great as you can be.

A go-to speech should always have a beginning, middle and end. The beginning sets the scene. The middle has a hardship which serves as a climax. The end illustrates how you were able to triumph.

The ability to make a go-to speech relatable to multiple audiences or demographics is paramount. The way to do this is to break down your story into its most basic components.

An example of making a speech like this relatable is to explain a situation from the you background and not rely on the technical strategy aspect. Instead focus on the feat of leading people or selling something. Leading people or making sales pitch of some sort is relatable to most everyone. Explaining the blast radius of a mortar or the packaging capacity in a factory may not be.

The people that you give this talk to have a need of some sort. If you're on a job interview then they need an employee. If you tell this to your employees they may need to know your track record. If you tell this to your client they may need to know how you can solve their problems.

Use your go-to speech to fill their need. Slightly tailor this talk to address their concerns or needs. If you can do this properly you will establish yourself as a problem solver. There is always room in the business world for people who fill needs and solve problems.

Do you have a go-to speech? What's it about and when have you used it? I'd love to hear all about it and how well it worked for you.

 An old business parable still rings true today. When a young leader, Able, took a new job he made the habit of asking one of his employee's, Calvin, every day when he came into work, "How will the weather be today?" Able just thought of it as a way to connect with his employee about a topic that affected everyone.

After the young leader had been with the company for a few months he hit the company's busy season. As a result, one morning when he came in he was so focused on his plans for the day that he walked right past Calvin. As soon as Able walked past Calvin he heard him say, "Hey, boss. It's going to be 85 degrees and sunny today!"

Able immediately stopped and asked Calvin why he told him that. Calvin answer was very telling. He said, "Because you're the weather man! You ask me about it every day since you started here like clockwork."

The moral of this story is that being consistent with your employees will benefit you. If Able had spent the time to ask Calvin a question that actually benefited their company every day imagine how much progress they would have made?

As a leader, your people's eyes will be on you. They'll listen to what you say and how you say it. So make it count. Take the time to ask questions that matter.

If you're trying to improve your company's safety culture, then take the time to ask about safety. If you want to verify that your people are following process protocol then ask about that. If you do this day in and day out results will soon follow.

If you have to work early in the morning you may not go out as often as you had in the past. You may have to go to work on a Saturday and miss a party that your friends are having. One of the more complex situations on this topic is getting a friend hired on with your company.

In a perfect world, this wouldn't be an issue. Your friend needs work and your company needs an employee. It could be too easy or it could ruin both relationships for you.  

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/2013/07/four-things-to-make-sure-of-before-getting-a-friend-hired/rope/" rel="attachment wp-att-525"><img alt="rope" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/files/2013/07/rope.jpg" width="269" height="187" /></a>

As a result of the potential downside I'm going to provide with four things that you better make sure of before you begin this effort. If you follow this list, I'm confident that you'll be prepared to make the important decision about helping get a friend hired. 

<strong>- Make sure they are qualified.</strong>

If your friend isn't qualified for the position that you're trying to get them hired for it won't hurt them in the long run. However, it sure may hurt your credibility for a long time.

<strong>- Make sure they are reliable.</strong>

Reliability is huge in business. If you can't trust this friend to show up to an interview on time, that's a problem. Make sure that they know to answer their phone if they get a call from an interviewer or future boss.

<strong>- Make sure they fit the culture.</strong>

If your company's atmosphere is intense and non-stop action it may not help anyone involved to recommend your friend who is super tame. The converse to this is true as well. This also holds true when dealing with a work place that has multiple languages being used. 

<strong>- Make sure they are prepared.</strong>

 You do not want to give out inside information that may damage your own standing with your company to a friend that is interviewing. With that said, there is nothing wrong with letting them know the basics of your company. Passing along some vernacular that's commonly used in your company may also go a long way.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/2013/07/four-things-to-make-sure-of-before-getting-a-friend-hired/coworker-friend/" rel="attachment wp-att-526"><img alt="coworker-friend" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/files/2013/07/coworker-friend.jpg" width="298" height="400" /></a>

Take these four things into consideration whenever you are deciding whether or not to help a friend get hired. If things work out you may be hero to everyone involved. If things go sour quickly it can also make you a villain.

Until next time, own your legacy...

Eventually the holiday ends and whether we got a day off because of it or if we got a week off you have to come back to work. When that time comes and you're back at work, you will still need to be the leader that you were before hand. Below are a few tips that will help your cause.

<strong>- Have an agenda.</strong>

If you come back to work without a plan of some sort you'll most likely feel like you're swimming in spaghetti. Let the other managers at your company feel that way while you and your team are accomplishing big things. You'll do this because you knew what needed to be done and how you were going to handle it.

- <strong>Use your routine.</strong>

As tempting as it may be to sleep an extra hour on the day after a holiday, don't do it. It's a trap. The same trap that your employees will want to fall into. Set the example by doing the things that you normally do in the morning and get to work on time or even a little earlier than usual.

- <strong>Communicate your expectations.</strong>

If you're going to treat the day after a holiday as a normal, productive day you need to take the time let your team know about it. This can be achieved by sending out an e-mail before the holiday telling everyone what you expect. It can also be reinforced verbally the morning that everyone comes back. If your people don't know what you expect of them it becomes much harder to hold them accountable at the highest level.

We all look forward to our next holiday for these exact reasons.

Eventually the holiday ends and whether we got a day off because of it or if we got a week off you have to come back to work. When that time comes and you're back at work, you will still need to be the leader that you were before hand. Below are a few tips that will help your cause.

<strong>- Have an agenda.</strong>

If you come back to work without a plan of some sort you'll most likely feel like you're swimming in spaghetti. Let the other managers at your company feel that way while you and your team are accomplishing big things. You'll do this because you knew what needed to be done and how you were going to handle it.

- <strong>Use your routine.</strong>

As tempting as it may be to sleep an extra hour on the day after a holiday, don't do it. It's a trap. The same trap that your employees will want to fall into. Set the example by doing the things that you normally do in the morning and get to work on time or even a little earlier than usual.

- <strong>Communicate your expectations.</strong>

If you're going to treat the day after a holiday as a normal, productive day you need to take the time let your team know about it. This can be achieved by sending out an e-mail before the holiday telling everyone what you expect. It can also be reinforced verbally the morning that everyone comes back. If your people don't know what you expect of them it becomes much harder to hold them accountable at the highest level.

In June I had my first blog entry about "A Secret To Success." This secret was to bet on yourself early and often. At the time that I wrote that I was in the middle of betting on myself in my career and I'm here to tell you that it works. If you'd like to give that blog a read the link is available here: <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/2013/06/a-secret-to-success-bet-on-yourself-early-and-often/">http://www.chicagonow.com/own-your-legacy/2013/06/a-secret-to-success-bet-on-yourself-early-and-often/</a>

The next secret to success that needs to be discussed is every bit as important as betting on yourself. Aim small, miss small is something that I learned in the Marine Corps. It's a thought process that began with weapons marksmanship but over time has been used in almost all facets of planning and leading. 

Aim small, miss small is all about creating a more clearly defined focus and end state. How can you know if you're on the path to success if you have never defined a goal or mission? You can't.

The first way to start this more focused approach to success is to evaluate whether or not you have a mission statement or vision statement. If this is something that you lack, don't worry these statements only take a little while to create.

The next step is to analyze your goals. Do you have goals? If so, are they written down? Have you told anyone what they are? If not, now is the time to start doing this.

Once you have a mission statement, a vision statement, and proper goals you are on the path. The way to maximize this path is when you can really begin separating yourself. This is the part when you have to define what is required for you to reach these goals. 

You also need to start deciding who can help you get to this point. If you don't know who those people are, start by deciding what type of people those are. A great example of this would be deciding that you need to find a mentor or that you need to reach out to a recruiter in your industry. Once you know what type of person can help you, it makes it easier to find those people.

If you take the time, energy, and investment into yourself that I have just outlined you'd be amazed at how far this will take you. If you couple it with betting on yourself early and often, well, now you're really cooking with grease.

Long term many of us have financial goals. We want to retire by a certain age (the sooner the better), pay for our kids to all the necessary tools to be successful, live in a home that we always have dreamed of, and loads of other things specific to our individual lives.

The way to start achieving these things to admit that you need to begin saving. In a perfect world this would be easy. That would be the case but sometimes admitting that we need to improve takes some time. Make that time now.

Once you've made the decision to save I believe that starting small is important. For the first week or two (or three if necessary) start with a dollar a day. If even that's too daunting try beginning with your spare change each night.

As this process progresses it is vital that you examine ways to cut spending. Can you do with out all of the premium channels for you TV? If so there is some money off the top. Can you buy your favorite products in bulk or even wait to buy certain things only when they're on sale? If so, these are simpler, painless ways to help create more money to save.

By now, you're ready to create an actual baseline budget. This can be time consuming and require you to be very honest with yourself. Once you do it, you will be better for it.

 After you're saving money, cutting spending, and have established a baseline budget it is time to begin saving your money off the top of your paycheck. When I first began doing this I thought that it make my life miserable. I was wrong. I actually found this to be an easy experience because it takes away from the angst I felt when I put my money into savings at the end of the month.

My final recommendation for beginning to save money on the home front is to see a professional financial planner. This recommendation requires you to open yourself up to constructive criticism but the risk/reward is out of this world. Do a little research and find someone who has positive reviews and take the leap.

<strong>"You get the job done"</strong>

Everyone loves having a co-worker her completes their tasks. At the end of the day that's why we all get a paycheck and what we all want people to say about us.

<strong>"You are a team player" </strong>

Many of us employ a team based strategy as leaders so it should be no surprise that we want the people around us to say we're team players ourselves.

<strong>"You are a difference maker"</strong>

I want for people to ask me to deal with big issues. That should be all of our mindset as leaders and if those around you feel the same way you're doing the right things on the job.

<strong>"You value time"</strong>

Time is money is an old cliche but it still holds true. You want to know as someone who values your own time as well as the other people you work with.

&nbsp;

<strong>"You have mutual respect"</strong>

The key to this is the word mutual. If people don't see you as being respectful to them they will be hesitant to respect you. As a boss you want and need as much respect as you can get.

&nbsp;

<strong>"You respond well in pressure situations"</strong>

The top leaders thrive in pressure situations. When your co-workers think about succeeding when the pressure is on make sure that you are who they think of.

If you don't believe that your co-workers are saying these types of positive things about you now is the time to change this. We are in control of our legacy and this is through our leadership. Continuous improvement is a necessary aspect to this and we are all capable of it.

Until next time, own your legacy...
