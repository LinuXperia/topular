        <p><img alt="Chicago Cubs" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/cubs_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />The four Major League free agents the Cubs have signed thus far in 2015 all have one thing in common: Each signed a contract for <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNChiCubs/status/676923341987532801">less guaranteed money than was offered elsewhere</a>. Why would guys pass up literally tens of millions of dollars to play on the North Side? The reasons are numerous, but it comes down to the fact that the Cubs have lost a lot -- <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>Everyone is familiar with the numbers. No World Series appearances since 1945. No World Series victories since 1908. But when you tell guys like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/heywaja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jason Heyward</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zobribe01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Ben Zobrist</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lackejo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">John Lackey</a> stats like that, their eyes light up. Why? Because of the chance to be on the field when that final out is made and Pat Hughes screams with pure happiness. They all have more money than they'll likely be able to spend in their lifetimes -- winning a title as a Chicago Cubs player makes you a legend almost beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>Look at how this city has propped up the 1985 Bears. Richard Dent can walk into a room today and own the place. Walter Payton jerseys outnumber all others when you go to Soldier Field. Mike Ditka is still as beloved as he was on January 26, 1986. A World Series trophy at Wrigley Field might burn the city down.</p>
        <p>But a century of heartache doesn't lure free agents alone. The recent losing for the Cubs, as part of a grand plan <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7147573/chicago-cubs-introduce-theo-epstein-president-baseball-operations">laid out clearly from day one by Theo Epstein</a>, has led to the drafting of core players like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kris Bryant</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schwaky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kyle Schwarber</a>. Others, like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rizzoan01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Anthony Rizzo</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/arrieja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jake Arrieta</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/russead02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Addison Russell</a>, have made their way to Wrigley via trades from a front office that didn't have to focus on wins and losses at the time they were acquired. All Epstein and Jed Hoyer cared about was grabbing as much high ceiling talent as they could.</p>

<p>That young core made it to the Majors or right to the cusp, and once it looked like the corner started to turn, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maddojo99.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Joe Maddon</a> unexpectedly hit the open market and became the instant favorite to lead the Cubs into the future. Combine that with the renovation and updating of a decrepit stadium to what will soon be a state-of-the-art facility -- while still hanging onto the ivy, the scoreboard and the bleachers -- and you've got a package that sells itself.</p>

<p>We've hit that point in professional sports where the money is so outrageous that guys will leave money on the table to pursue a championship dream. Every professional sport has seen it. Tom Brady is the <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/rankings/cash/quarterback/">11th highest paid quarterback in the NFL</a>. LeBron James, Dwanye Wade and Chris Bosh all took less to win rings. Even Jonathon Toews and Patrick Kane took slight discounts from what they could've made as free agents to remain teammates and try to keep building on an already impressive dynasty.</p>

<p>The Cubs organization built the foundation, brick by brick. And now they get to reap the rewards. It probably didn't hurt their chances when their <a href="http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2015/10/13/154355122/kyle-schwarber-called-home-run-over-scoreboard">rookie left fielder hit a homer seemingly 500 feet above the head of the guy they offered $184 million to</a>. Or when their projected fifth infielder hit a <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v522674083">titanic opposite field blast</a> off their now number three pitcher in the deciding game of the NLDS.</p>

<p>Going into the offseason, the <a href="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/2015/11/names_to_watch_in_the_cubs_free_agent_extravaganza/">Cubs' wish list</a> was an upper echelon starter, an ace defensive center fielder, and a couple of guys who could get on base while maintaining a high contact rate. They got all three, and also re-upped <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cahiltr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Trevor Cahill</a>, who ended up being their seventh inning reliever in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The Cubs are now armed with <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-cubs-as-the-best-team-in-baseball/">arguably the best team in baseball</a>, managed by <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/13186480/who-mlb-best-manager-survey-says">the best manager</a>, led by the a front office that has not only built the club into a powerhouse at the major league level, but who has also hoarded enough young talent that still ranks among the best in the game. </p>

<p>They say money can't buy happiness. And the Cubs are living proof.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Fire" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/fire_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left">The time for Chicago Fire fans to rejoice is once again nigh, as the 2015 Major League Soccer season is but days away from drawing to a close. The playoffs are all but done and dusted, and <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/story/2733787/portland-timbers-and-columbus-crew-sc-to-meet-in-mls-cup">only this Sunday's MLS Cup is in the offing</a>. It is doubtless then that supporters of The Men In Red&mdash;<a href="http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Druids+Celebrate+Winter+Solstice+Stonehenge+7mQFW34an19l.jpg">like pagans gathering at Stonehenge in anticipation of the winter solstice</a>&mdash;are feeling the frisson of excitement which signals the coming of their annual celebration of change and growth for the team: the annual roster shake-up and its attendant transfer frenzy.</p>

<p>Take heed, as these words do not come from a place of snark. The offseason player movements have become in many ways the most thrilling event of the year. There are many reasons for why this has become such an interesting and exciting time for the team and its fans, but it mostly boils down to the mystery of it all. Which players will find themselves suddenly on the outs? Who can Chicago manage to snag in the offseason? <a href="http://www.onceametro.com/2015/12/2/9836714/rumor-carlos-vela-move-to-mls-imminent-chicago-fire-san-jose-earthquakes-new-york-red-bulls">Might it actually be Mexican star Carlos Vela</a>?</p>
        <p>For starters, in a mid-major soccer league like MLS, player scouting and acquisition is something that must practiced extremely judiciously. Given the looming spectre of the salary cap enforcing a sense of league-wide parity, the players that are targeted are often those in the middle of the sport. Quality players on the verge of becoming great, playing in a similarly positioned league on the world stage. Rather than detract based on a lack of name recognition, these factors seem to imbue each player signing with a sense of wonder. There is no preset expectation of how any one player will perform.</p>

<p> It is almost an understatement to say that the team has just weathered its worst season. The Fire finished their campaign dead last in the league managing a dismal 30 points through 34 games, for an  average of just 0.88 points per game. </p>

<p>If there is to be found a silver lining in such thick cloud cover, one needs to consider three main factors. The first is that the 2015 Chicago Fire team didn't end up on this <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/12/the-10-worst-teams-in-mls-history.html">Paste Magazine list of the 10 worst MLS teams</a>, though they certainly qualify. The second is that hitting rock bottom puts the Fire in the admirable position of having the number one draft pick in the 2016 MLS SuperDraft, which will likely see them select Joshua Yaro, the Georgetown defender and best player of the incoming crop not named Jordan Morris. Third, and perhaps most important, was that it also spurred team brass to trigger a nuclear option-style reset of the culture and approach. The house cleaning that has occurred since September has been resolute and near total, seeing not just the departure of head coach Frank Yallop, but also that of several other key on-field staff including goalkeeping coach Aron Hyde whose work with Sean Johnson had led to the pair being brought into several U.S. national team training camps.</p>

<p>These whirlwind moves also saw the appointment of longtime MLS company man Nelson Rodriguez to the role of General Manager, a position which had been vacant in Bridgeview since the days of the legendary Peter Wilt.</p>

<p>As the days wound down toward Thanksgiving, several sources began reporting that Rodriguez and his staff would be announcing the new head coach of the Fire before the holiday itself. This came as sweet relief, as discussion and speculation over who would land the top spot had nearly reached a crescendo. Names that had been associated with the head coach position ranged from plausible options such as Jason Kreis and Mike Petke, to more blue sky fare like the Columbus Crew's legendary Argentine Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Heck, at one time even less-than-stellar former Fire player Pavel Pardo was apparently in the mix.</p>

<p>Surely enough though, on the morning of November 24th the news began to trickle across Twitter that the Fire had <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/fire-confidential/2015/11/rodriguez-banks-on-paunovic-with-fire-coaching-hire/">subverted expectations by signing Veljko Paunović</a> to lead the rebuilding on the field. Paunović may be new to coaching, but his has been an auspicious beginning to say the least. This summer Paunović was head coach of the Serbia U-20 national team at the U-20 World Cup, a run which saw them winning the tournament. He has his bona fides in place as a player as well, having spent the majority of his career in La Liga with various clubs including Atletico Madrid, before ending his playing days with the Philadelphia Union in 2011 giving him that all important quality of MLS experience, however fleeting.</p>

<p>In the past week now, news has come out that the team has exercised options on only four of its players, Kingsley Bryce, Matt Polster, Harry Shipp, and Patrick Doody. This leaves the team with around 14 currently-filled roster spots, including all three Designated Players with Gilberto, David Accam, and Kennedy Igboananike. The players whose options have been declined are not necessarily on their way out the door just yet, though time will tell. Also without contracts at this time are Ty Harden, Matt Watson, and most disconcertingly, Mike Magee.</p>

<p>The so-called "<a href="http://www.phillysoccerpage.net/2012/11/27/the-silly-season-and-why-its-uniquely-silly-in-soccer/">silly season</a>" is upon us now, and fans can only hope that those who are now in charge of club stewardship are as focussed on creating a winning club as they claim to be. The coming roster moves will hopefully provide much excitement in the absence of domestic soccer to watch. If nothing else, it is bound to be more fun than watching the team in 2015.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Cubs" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/cubs_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />Maybe the best thing about the 2015 Cubs was their versatility. Nearly every non-catcher position player on the team played multiple positions at one point or another. It made for weird lineups and some raised eyebrows at times, but it was a fantastic way to keep the rookies on their toes.</p>

<p>That same versatility allows the Cubs to go in whatever direction presents itself going forward. If someone makes a play at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/solerjo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jorge Soler</a>, Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer know they have options. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kris Bryant</a> could play right field, or even <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/coghlch01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Chris Coghlan</a> could do it for a year while <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=mckinn002bil&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Billy McKinney</a> continues his development. If a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/castrst01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Starlin Castro</a> deal presents itself, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/baezja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Javier Baez</a> can play second immediately and be at least league average simply from his defense.</p>

<p>All options are available, but expectations need to be maintained. <a href="http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2015/10/31/9645586/first-look-cubs-2016-payroll">The Cubs already have roughly $110 million earmarked</a> for the players signed for 2016. That includes realistic raises for all arbitration and pre-arbitration players. It's unlikely the team goes out and dumps $40 million in first year salaries to free agents. The boatloads of money for spending are still years away when the Cubs start their own TV network.</p>
        <p>Though there's technically no such thing as an untouchable player, you can put the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEB7WbTTlu4">guarantee stamp</a> on Bryant, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rizzoan01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Anthony Rizzo</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/russead02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Addison Russell</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schwaky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kyle Schwarber</a> not going anywhere in the foreseeable future. They're all stars already, and all possess traits that are in short supply around baseball.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, the Cubs do have needs. Another ace starter would be awesome to have, but remember, they led the league in FIP and WAR for the season. That doesn't happen by sending a bunch of hacks out to the mound -- the Cubs were pitching dependent for essentially the first four months of 2015. If the numbers don't look right, it won't happen. Luckily, the free agent market is loaded with premium arms, which may help bring the overall dollars down a bit. Heck, the Cubs may come out of this winter with two quality starters. Supply and demand at its finest.</p>

<p>A centerfielder is a must, too. The Cubs don't have anyone on the roster that can play above average out there and be league average with the bat, so it's a good bet they add here. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fowlede01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Dexter Fowler</a> was great in 2015, but if he wants more than three years at $13 million per season, you're better off to just pass. </p>

<p>And if you're getting real greedy, a proven relief pitcher wouldn't hurt the cause either.</p>

<p>So let's look at all the viable options out on the market. You'll hear the Cubs linked to just about everyone because that's an agent's job: to throw his client's name out on the interweb with every team name he can think of to try and fool others into thinking there's a huge market for him. Don't get me wrong, for a lot of these guys, the list of suitors is long, but the names below are the only ones that will garner long discussions in the gallows of Wrigley Field. I'll also throw in some names to ignore so you understand why they don't fit.</p>

<h3>Starting Pitchers</h3>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/priceda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">David Price</a></strong><br />
He's the cream of the crop for many folks. He's got a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/y/youngcy01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Cy Young</a> on his book case at home, and another second place finish, all while pitching in the division of baseball that for many years was the most hitting-dominant. It hasn't been like that the past couple seasons, but he's still held his own against the best the American League can throw at him.</p>

<p>He's pitched 200-plus innings in five of the past six seasons, keeps himself in pristine physical shape, and has no problem taking the ball in any situation. He walks and talks like an ace too, and that means a $200 million deal is going to get thrown his direction. He loves <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maddojo99.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Joe Maddon</a>, and has pined for playing in the National League because it allows him the opportunity to hit consistently. By moving to the easier league, he could also pencil in an additional 50 strikeouts on an annual basis.</p>

<p>The one knock on him that many have is that he hasn't pitched well in the postseason. In 63 October and November innings, he sports a 5.12 ERA. Should the Cubs shy away from a guy they'd be signing to hopefully pitch in that exact spot? Absolutely not. His strikeout to walk ratio in the playoffs is nearly 6-to-1, and his WHIP is a very respectable 1.17. His playoff problem has been giving up the long ball: 11 total, which is about double the rate he gives them up in the regular season. He's worth every penny of that $200 million he'll receive. And a bonus for those signing him -- he won't cost his new employer a draft pick because he was traded during the 2015 season. That fact is one the Cubs aren't likely to forget, as it was among the litany of reasons they went after <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lestejo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jon Lester</a> last winter.</p>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greinza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Zack Greinke</a></strong><br />
The 32-year-old opted out of his contract with the Dodgers to strike big in free agency again while his stock is at its absolute peak. He'll finish among the top three in the NL Cy Young this season, and although he's got fantastic stuff, he gets hitters out mostly on pinpoint location and a fantastic game plan. Though Price is two years his junior, Greinke may also cross the $200 million threshold once thought impossible for pitchers to receive.</p>

<p>Price will probably age better because of his age and handedness, but Greinke will likely return the most immediate value -- which oftentimes is what teams bank on. They know the back end of these contracts is likely to go sour, but if they get above dollar performance early in the deal, they can still chalk it up as a success. If Price is 1, then Greinke is 1A. Both guys are legit, and the Cubs will be heavily involved with both.</p>

<p>If the Cubs sign a guy like Price or Greinke, they won't be spending $30-plus million on a centerfielder. In those scenarios, look for them to dangle Castro, Baez or other guys in their still loaded farm system to play a great defensive center field to cover for the sins of the below average defenders the team would likely flank him with.</p>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zimmejo02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jordan Zimmermann</a></strong><br />
Say the Cubs spent some money on a free agent centerfielder (more on that to come), and wanted a quality starter who wouldn't cost $150 million. Zimmermann is where the line begins.</p>

<p>He's an upper-Midwest guy who's plenty used to playing in the cold weather, and posted an ERA of exactly 3.00 from 2011 to 2014. But in 2015, his fastball velocity dropped, and his ERA jumped to 3.44. He's still talented, and his fastball may bounce right back this season, but it's not a guarantee. He won't turn 30 until mid-2016, and he's a guy many teams will see as one worth betting on.</p>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/samarje01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jeff Samardzija</a></strong><br />
This isn't a joke. No, seriously, the Cubs wouldn't hesitate to bring Shark back north, but only if the price is right. That price is somewhere in the two years, $28 million total range. Samardzija is far too hot and cold to make a big commitment on, and he might be <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2014/6/18/5822630/jeff-samardzija-contract-offer-rumors-cubs">regretting not taking the $85 million</a> the team reportedly offered him a few years back.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he's a tireless worker who takes the ball every fifth day, and flashes number two starter ability. It may seem like guys like that grow on trees in this pitching-dominant world we live in now, but they simply don't. He's valuable at a reasonable contract.</p>

<p><strong>Don't Be Fooled By...</strong><br />
<em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cuetojo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Johnny Cueto</a></em>: If you asked general managers in April of 2015, you might've gotten some guys who preferred Cueto over either Price or Greinke. It's hard to argue with that logic either. Cueto was lights out for the better part of four years when healthy -- posting sub-3.00 ERAs from 2011 on until stumbling in 2015 while battling arm injuries. But there's the problem: he can't stay healthy, and the Cubs won't risk a long-term deal. If he's still on the market in February and would take a two-year deal... the Cubs might be interested. Don't bank on that, though.</p>

<p><em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/leakemi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Mike Leake</a></em>: In a world of flame throwers, 90 MPH throwing Mike Leake might get very well get $90 million. Why? Because he's never had arm problems, gets ground balls, throws 200 innings per season, and is a superb athlete who's able to field his position, run the bases and swing the bat. That's a lot in one small package. Though the Cubs might show interest, it's just for due diligence purposes. If they're spending $50 million or more on a pitcher, they want potential impact. Leake is what we all hope <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hendrky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kyle Hendricks</a> turns into one day.</p>

<h3>Centerfielders</h3>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/heywaja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jason Heyward</a></strong><br />
Yes, he's played right field for the majority of his career, but he can play center and he'd likely be one of the best defensively, like he is in right. He makes such great reads on the ball that he doesn't have to rely on his above average speed that much.</p>

<p>That's precisely what the Cubs are looking for: a defensive stud who can handle the bat a little. It just so happens that he handles the bat quite a bit better than average. He has 20 homer potential, but nobody acquiring his services expects or even necessarily hopes for that. They want him for his high on-base and contact skills.</p>

<p>He'd be an absolute perfect fit for this Cubs team. They lack a difference-making CF in the system, and he's one just entering his prime. He won't turn 27 until late next season and is going to sign for over $200 million somewhere.</p>

<p>If it were me running the Cubs, he'd be my top target. You can trade for the pitching depth, but position players this talented are rarely ever available without giving up the farm. In this case, all it would cost is a first-round draft pick (which the Cubs would get back when Fowler signs elsewhere) and a whole lot of Benjamins.</p>

<p><strong>Dexter Fowler</strong><br />
Don't get me wrong, he was one of the key reasons the Cubs made it as far as they did in 2015. He struggled in the first half, but his bat after the All-Star break ignited the team. He played a solid center field, too. So why isn't the team bending over backward to sign him? It's probably because they think last year was peak Fowler, and I tend to agree. He's never going to be a guy who robs base hits and doubles from the other team, but he'll make the plays that are there. With the big bats the Cubs project to play in the corners the next few years, an offense-tilted guy in center doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you can get Fowler to re-sign for three years at $13 million or so per season, you probably do it to buy yourself time to figure out what to do out there in the future. Even though he may not be an ideal fit going forward, value is value for a team with playoff aspirations, and he's a guy who will contribute to a postseason-bound team here or elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/spande01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Denard Span</a></strong><br />
The definition of a short term solution that allows you to move the pieces around the chess board to solve a long term problem is none other than Denard Span. He's 31 years old and coming off a season where he spent a bunch of time on the disabled list due to back and hip injuries -- not the type of stuff that really makes you want to spend big on him. He's just a solid all around baseball player. Solid defender, solid hitter, solid baserunner. When he's healthy, you're not going to say anything about him carrying you. He just quietly goes out and does his job. Is he exactly what the Cubs want in CF? Surely not three to four years from now, but in 2016 he'd probably be OK.</p>

If you're looking for an on-base machine, he's not the guy for you. What he does bring to the table is better than average defense, Fowler-like speed, and and the ability to get you 40-50 extra base hits a season. One thing he doesn't help the Cubs with is their propensity for strikeouts, as his career average has him walking back to the dugout once a game.</p>

<p>Though he shored up the Cubs' defense after getting dealt to Chicago late in 2015, I think the idea of bringing him in was more for evaluation. What better way to see what a guy can do than to have him play right in front of you everyday? His offensive numbers weren't great, but I think he made an impression on the organization, and it might result in a four-year, $50 million deal.</p>

<em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gordoal01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Alex Gordon</a></em>: Gordon is a fantastic player. He's easily the best defensive left fielder in baseball, and pairs that with fantastic bat-to-ball and on-base skills. He's the real deal, but he's also turning 32 in February. According to Bruce Levine, the Cubs sent out questionnaires to their internal folks recently asking if they thought Gordon could handle CF. The results are unknown, but I wouldn't pay to find out the answer.</p>

<p><em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zobribe01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Ben Zobrist</a></em>: Another fantastic player, but the Cubs just don't need to spend a bunch of cash on a guy whose value resides in his ability to do everything. They already have guys who can go out and play multiple positions once or twice a week, and Zobrist shouldn't be playing CF anymore. </p>

<h3>Relievers</h3>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sippto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Tony Sipp</a></strong><br />
He's older (32), and possesses a shorter history of success than most bullpen arms that are his age. Nonetheless, he's been great in Houston the past two seasons, and the Cubs could use a shutdown lefty. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/woodtr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Travis Wood</a> is likely to remain in the bullpen because of how great he pitched there, but the team hasn't found any other lefties in recent years they could rely on. Sipp could be the answer.</p>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cahiltr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Trevor Cahill</a></strong><br />
Forget about the wild pitch in the playoffs -- Cahill was dominant in a Cubs uniform. He struck out 22 in his 17 regular season innings, and walked just five. Some are wondering whether at 27 years old, some team might try him again as a starter. I don't see it. What made him great in the bullpen was increased velocity and the fact that he didn't have to set hitters up to try and get them out later in games. You can make a lot of money as a reliever these days, and Cahill should just be focused on that from now on.</p>

<p><strong><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lowema01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Mark Lowe</a></strong><br />
He'll turn 33 in mid-2016, and has always had a problem staying healthy. That means he can be had on a one-year deal, or one plus an option. If you've noticed how the Cubs have addressed their bullpen holes in recent years (see: Motte, Jason and Soriano, Rafael), you'd know that Lowe is the type of guy they'd pursue.</p>

<p><strong>Don't Be Fooled By...</strong><br />
<em><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/odayda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Darren O'Day</a></em>: Though his four-year stretch as a reliever in recent years is just about the best there is, he's a side-winding righty. If deployed correctly (and Joe Maddon would handle him right), he's a weapon. But if you have guys like that in your bullpen who have limited utility, it almost forces you to carry an extra pitcher at all times, and I think the Cubs would prefer to get away from that in future seasons.</p>

<p>There are a few other names to keep an eye on here and there to fill holes -- think <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kenneia01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Ian Kennedy</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/happja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">J.A. Happ</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fistedo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Doug Fister</a> -- but I think the only reason those names would pop up is if Heyward ended up signing with the Cubs. Though he'd be my top priority, I think the likelihood is below 10 percent.</p>

<p>Don't get caught up thinking about all the possibilities of a Cubs roster with every rumor you hear. You'll go insane, and you'll just end up knocking all the pieces on the floor like an irate 6-year-old. Stick to the names above, and you'll be able to tell what's real and what's not.<br />

        <p>When I mention to friends that I still watch and very much enjoy WWE and pro wrestling, I get the snide remark of "you know it's fake right?" This used to drive me crazy, but I just shake it off and say, "you know that Game of Thrones is fake right?" Professional wrestling is entertainment and a great show. It's a mix of stage theatrics and pure athleticism that I will never achieve in my lifetime. There are many independent wrestling organizations throughout the country, but Chicago is home to a local organization, <a href="http://www.freelancewrestling.com/">Freelance Wrestling</a>.</p>

<p>Nick Almendurez wears many hats for Freelance. He is the founder, owner, matchmaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/FreelanceWres">social media guru</a> and even a talent, going by the ring name Marvelous Matt Knicks, who is part of the tag team the Four Star Heroes with Chris Castro. Freelance has a show coming up on Friday, October 30 at <a href="http://www.theabbeychicago.com/">The Abbey Pub</a>, "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/514471255382904/">Walk Among Us</a>". Almendurez was nice enough to chat with me to give an insight into how a wrestling show is set up and what fans can expect to see on the 30th.</p>
        <p><b>Can you tell a little bit how Freelance Wrestling got its start?</b><br />
Not many people know that the original idea for Freelance was to do something similar to what Beyond Wrestling was doing. They're based out of the East Coast and their shows were intended for the wrestlers, performed by the wrestlers and there was no crowds in the arena and the shows were just filmed for YouTube. I was thinking to do something similar like that in the Midwest for guys who couldn't make it out that far. </p>

<p>At that time, we had did one show like that around 2013 but Beyond started to do sleeper cells, shows similar to that in places like St. Louis and Florida, and that negated my idea. So we went back to the drawing board. I thought I want to do a live event with myself and a couple of my friends and do it to have fun. I didn't think it would make it past one show, so I asked wrestlers I liked to attend and our first show was June 27, 2014 at Abbey Pub.</p>

<p><b>How did you get the word out about that first show?</b><br />
I did some hard promotion on that, hitting every neighborhood I could, hanging up flyers in coffee shops and anywhere I could. We had a decent crowd show up and people wanted to come out again and just said, screw it, let's do another show.</p>

<p><b>So it seemed like you did more pop up shows at the beginning with just some cool matches booked. But now you guys are a bigger organization, did that change your overall storytelling of the shows and what type of matches you have?</b><br />
Once we got a grasp on what we wanted to do, we started injecting some story into it. We planted some story seeds into the first show, just in case this becomes something and we can build off of and not fly blindly in the night [for future shows].</p>

<p><a href="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Freelance%20Walk%20Among%20Us.jpg"><img alt="Freelance Walk Among Us.jpg" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/assets_c/2015/10/Freelance Walk Among Us-thumb-451x667-17506.jpg" width="451" height="667" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a><br />
<b>You said that you are the booker (wrestling lingo for the person who decides the matches and their order), but do you have any other creative members on the team?</b><br />
A lot of the hard booking me and Jack [Edinger, co-booker and production manager for Freelance] will do. We'll usually talk through email or text throughout the weeks leading up to the shows, but usually the week of the show we'll meet together and put things down on paper of how we want the direction of the show to go. That way we have a good outline and we can present it to the roster.</p>

<p>Something I like to do, which I'm sure other people like to do, is have the talent heavily involved in what they are doing. I feel like it's a little bit more organic, as opposed to telling people each step and they're reciting it and it doesn't feel real. I usually tell them, this is kinda what I'm thinking and kinda where I want it go, how do you want to get there. So we talk about it and figure out a way to do the story for them and the company.</p>

<p><b>So a member of the roster will pitch you a story and you bounce back and forth ideas?</b><br />
Yeah pretty much. I think that's the most fun and when the guys in the ring are having fun, then the crowd is having fun.</p>

<p><b>What can those who are attending or are thinking about attending expect for the show on Oct. 30th?</b><br />
It will be back at Abbey Pub and we have "The Ego" Robert Anthony finally meeting Isaias Velazquez for the Freelance Wrestling Championship. We'll also see a battle royale featuring "Stars of the 80's".</p>

<p><b>Does that mean guys are going to dress up like old school wrestlers from the 80's?</b><br />
Yeah [laughs] Cause it's a halloween show we'll have a bunch of guys in costumes, which will make it a really great show.</p>

<p>The event is being held Friday, October 30th at The Abbey Pub. Doors open at 9 pm and is scheduled to begin at 10 pm. Tickets are priced at $15 and <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=6140815&pl=abbey&REFID=wordpress">can be found here</a>.<br />

        <p><img src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/bulls_200.jpg" alt="Bulls" height="200" width="200" class="left" />The Chicago Bulls have rarely strayed from their roots. Throughout their 49-year existence, they have maintained the same design, color scheme, and logo for their franchise. There have been some tweaks here and there, but if this <a href="http://thebiglead.com/2015/07/11/spend-the-rest-of-your-day-lookat-at-this-nba-team-logo-evolution-gif/" target="_blank">gif</a> is any explanation, they are quite confident about how their logo looks. But for the 2015-2016 season, the team has decided to deviate from the norm and introduced a <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150923/BLOGS04/150929942/chicago-bulls-unveil-new-court-design" target="_blank">new court design</a> in September. The new floor is a great mix of old- and new school and still prominently features the bull logo in the middle.</p>

<p>Let's first take a moment to appreciate the Bulls logo. The standard bull design is a classic that isn't too cartoonish or intense on the eyes. There may be some hometown bias, but the <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-definitive-nba-logo-rankings/" target="_blank">national pundits</a> have praised the logo over the years.</p>
        <p>Now that our appreciation is out of the way, let's take a look at the new court design. Even the slightest change of a logo, court design or the positioning of one letter on a jersey is heavily scrutinized by the league. They are invested in all of these teams and a new design may skew their business model. With the Bulls' drastic new court look, they obviously gave the A-OK for a relaunch.</p>

<p><img alt="Bulls Full Court Design.png" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Bulls%20Full%20Court%20Design.png" width="600" height="311" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<h3>Center Court Logo</h3>

<p>It may not look like it at first, but the center court logo is actually 75 percent bigger than the previous incarnation and does not have a basketball behind it. Teams in the NBA have been experimenting with drastic court redesigns the last few years, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucks/status/650352398402060288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">some good</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/622484321530556416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">some bad</a>, but it's still a pretty cool idea that they kept the core of their old court intact. The Bulls have four other logos on the court, two positioned on each side of the court. The story goes that when the Bulls moved to the United Center from the Chicago Stadium for the 1994-1995 season, head coach Phil Jackson ordered for those logos to remain because it helped him run plays better. Jackson could wield so much power during that time that he forced the team to redesign the court to suit his playmaking.</p>

<h3>Lettering</h3>

<p><img alt="Bulls Lettering.png" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/Bulls%20Lettering.png" width="232" height="29" class="right" />I have to say, this is my favorite adjustment. It may be the nitpicking writer in me, but I love how they changed the type for the baselines and sidelines. No longer will we have to endure the puffy-lettering of yesteryear. All of it is based off the official team font, which I think gives the court a great, cohesive look.</p>

<p>Even more exciting is the positioning of the four Chicago stars at the front of the court. The outline is still black, but the bold red stars make this section of the court pop.</p>

<p>Rebranding is very common when teams are trying to start a new phase of their franchise history. The team is not totally starting over, but it is a cool new look to help begin the Hoiberg era. A lot of players are in the tail end of their career and it might be now or never for this club. With the exception of the occasional <a href="http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/teamsites/images/legacy/bulls/noah_losbulls_120229_0.jpg" target="_blank">Los Bulls jerseys</a> and the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2463173-first-look-at-leaked-images-of-2015-nba-christmas-day-uniforms" target="_blank">Vanilla Coke-designed Christmas threads</a>, there may not be more change for the Bulls look besides the court this year. But hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Cubs" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/cubs_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />The feelings come at different times when your favorite team loses in the postseason. Some people spot the signs early and prepare themselves for what's to come. Others don't see it until the last possible moment, and they move quickly through <a href="http://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/">five universally known stages of grief</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to feel the way they want. Your way isn't wrong. Neither is mine, and we certainly don't have to agree on it. In the end, we'll all end up in the same place: flipping on the television on April 5 when the Cubs open up the 2016 season against the LA Angels.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schwaky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kyle Schwarber</a> will continue to play in the outfield (and also at catcher). <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/solerjo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jorge Soler</a> too. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kris Bryant</a> will be at third, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rizzoan01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Anthony Rizzo</a> at first, and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maddojo99.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Joe Maddon</a> will have his hands on the controls in the dugout. Nothing is wrong with these guys. They ran into a buzzsaw of a pitching staff, filled with guys who throw 95-plus with movement and precision. If they weren't hitting the corners, the series would've probably been different.</p>
        <p>Getting this far in 2015 was unexpected and fun. It was a bunch of kids going out there and enjoying every single moment. They partied after wins, and held their heads high after losses. The Mets were better the last few days -- no question about it. And if you're wondering why they kept pitching to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/murphda08.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Daniel Murphy</a>, it's the same reason why you let <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/player_search.cgi?results=smithjo07,smith-022jos&utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Josh Smith</a> shoot wide open 20-footers. He's going to start missing a bunch at some point, and you don't want to be giving away base runners (or drives to the basket) in the process.</p>

<p>If teams as young as the Cubs need to experience loss and heartache before getting to the World Series stage, then hopefully this was like the '89-'90 Bulls; a young team with a new coach employing an unorthodox philosophy getting to the brink of the Finals. Those teams responded by working harder and making themselves better. Don't expect any different from the Cubs players.</p>

<p>Teams rarely look the same year over year, and the Cubs won't be any different. They lacked the depth of aces necessary to carry the team when the offense was floundering, so don't be surprised when names like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/priceda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">David Price</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/z/zimmejo02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jordan Zimmermann</a> are floated around. The corner outfielders are weaker defenders, so Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer will likely respond with a defensive whiz in center to cover up some of their sins. A power lefty-reliever you say? No problem, they've got the assets to go get one.</p>

<p>That's the best part about all this. The arrow is still pointing up, and it's a big damn arrow. The rookies will likely improve their games, and they have gobs of new money to spend. "The Plan" worked. All the scouting, the trading, the ballpark rebuilding has developed into what Epstein envisioned since his first press conference. The fun is just beginning.</p>

<p>This is the end of the season, but the start of an era. Feel however you want now, and I'll meet you at excited whenever you're ready.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Cubs" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/cubs_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" /><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maddojo99.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Joe Maddon</a>'s sole focus is to put the Cubs in the best position to win every single game. He's had that mindset since the April 5th season opener against the Cardinals, and hasn't strayed from it since. For the most part, he builds what he considers the strongest offensive lineup against the opponent's starting pitcher. The goal is simple: get a lead in the first six innings, and gradually maneuver into a lineup that is more defensive oriented to give the bullpen the best chance at holding the lead.</p>

<p>This also means that nobody's spot in the lineup is safe. Though <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rizzoan01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Anthony Rizzo</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kris Bryant</a> are going to be on the field everyday, they have no idea until the lineup card is posted in the clubhouse where they'll be hitting. And for Bryant, he has no idea where he'll play positionally. The only person who knows where they're fielding and batting every day is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fowlede01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Dexter Fowler</a>, who has started all but three of his 149 games as the leadoff hitter playing in center.</p>

<p>The biggest question going into every game recently has been who's flanking the steady Fowler in the outfield. Is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schwaky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kyle Schwarber</a> in left field, or is it right field tonight because Pittsburgh is a notoriously hard place for a hitting-focused left fielder? Is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/coghlch01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Chris Coghlan</a> in the lineup, or is Maddon going to buck the lefty hitter/righty pitcher matchup to get <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/solerjo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jorge Soler</a>'s powerful bat in the order?</p>
        <p>It's a great problem to have. Most managers are locked into a lineup because they lack depth. The Cubs are lucky enough to have both depth and flexibility, and Maddon stretches those traits to the absolute maximum to give his team an advantage.</p>

<p>Against <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wachami01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Michael Wacha</a>, the usual corner outfield conundrum will once again be the question going into Game 3 of the NLDS. It's doubtful that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lasteto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Tommy La Stella</a> starts at third to push Bryant into one of the outfield corners. Schwarber will almost certainly return to the lineup to play left field and bat second after sitting in Game 2, so the only remaining question is what the Cubs will do in right field: Soler or Coghlan?</p>

<p>Wacha historically fares better against left handed hitters, posting a .214/.280/.268 slash line against them over the last three years, as opposed to .242/.298/.397 against right handers. Soler has looked fantastic at bat against the Cardinals, reaching base in each of his five plate appearances thus far. Coghlan struggled in his Game 1 start against <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lackejo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">John Lackey</a>, and holding him out of the starting lineup also keeps a home run capable lefty on the bench for a possible pinch hit situation later in the game.</p>

<p>Where Soler will bat in the lineup is another question entirely. Fowler, Schwarber, Bryant and Rizzo are probably locked into the top four spots. The fifth spot is where you could see Soler pop up, but Castro will likely stay put there because of his contact-oriented style behind a group of guys who get on base. Montero will probably bat sixth, which leaves Soler to bat seventh. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/russead02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Addison Russell</a> will follow to hit eighth like he did in the one-game playoff against Pittsburgh, with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/arrieja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jake Arrieta</a> hopefully pitching a complete game shutout in the ninth spot.</p>

<p>Flexibility and depth have been keys to the Cubs success since opening day. They've used dozens of lineup combinations to start and put guys in defensive positions where they might have felt uncomfortable. It's all to prepare them for outlandish situations that tend to pop up in the playoffs -- so they're not seeing things for the first time in a pressure spot.</p>

<p>We've seen Maddon's lineups turn out exactly as planned, too. Just look at the second game of 2015. Arrieta pitched seven shutout innings, La Stella and Coghlan started and were removed for defensive replacements late in the game, and the Cubs beat the Cardinals 2-0. We can only hope that near-term history repeats itself, because this Cubs team has made it clear that they don't care about anything else.</p>

Better chemistry can help long meetings go by quickly or an assembly around the water cooler to be more jovial, but the goal of any business and the responsibility of any co-worker is to get the job done.</p>

<p>In the realm of professional sports, that feeling can be a bit different. We forget that playing sports is a full-time job. Players may get hefty contracts or <a href="http://www.thehabarinetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Derrick-Rose-and-Pizza.jpg">lavish endorsement deals</a>, but this is still their 9-to-5 gig. And chemistry plays an integral part in how a team thrives. We have witnessed teams succeed when there is a <a href="http://abc7chicago.com/sports/cubs-fans-celebrate-clinching-playoff-spot-in-wrigleyville/1002906/">good clubhouse</a> and awed at the <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/2015-mlb-washington-nationals-bryce-harper-jonathan-papelbon-fight-matt-williams/">tire fires of bad chemistry</a>. For the Chicago Bulls, there may be a bit of turmoil brewing between their top employees.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of the 2015 playoffs, there were <a href="http://www.blogabull.com/2015/7/28/9044723/jimmy-butler-derrick-rose-beef-tension-rumors">rumors circulating</a> that Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler were developing a bit of a beef. You could tell by the final game of the playoffs that both players were checked out and ready for vacation. Rose looked more passive while Butler grinded away, but his efforts felt unrequited. Granted, these two players aren't the most animated in the NBA, so the notion that they were at odds should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>But over the summer, neither player did anything to dispel the rumor that they were each itching to be the heir apparent to <a href="http://sportsmockery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JordanStatue.jpg" target="_blank">number 23</a>. It created a whole mess of odd drama, which gave the media plenty to write about, but Rose and Butler didn't really want to expand upon any of these points. During Butler's contract extension press conference, over general manager Gar Forman's <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/butler-to-beat-reporter-you-sounded-like-thibs-for-a-second-there-video-070915">Emperor Palpatine-like laugh</a>, he scoffed at the notion there was any type of issue with Rose.</p>

<p>"With the more time that we're out there we'll definitely get better at it," Butler said on July 9. "Off the floor, I mean he has a son, so he has a family that he has to take care of...But I mean when we have a chance we'll hang around each other, but I feel like we spend enough time together on the court. I think when you're off the court then you go your separate ways a little bit.''</p>

<p>There is absolutely no problem with the two superstars going their separate ways once they punch out after the work day, but the way Butler went about addressing the issue seemed to show that he and Rose were not clicking, even on the court. The passive aggressive attitude shows that there may be some underlying tension between the two. </p>

<p>During the <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/995712/derrick-rose-makes-clear-priority-list-starts-free-agency-two-years">Bulls media day</a> on Sept. 28, Rose unleashed a cavalcade of awkward quotes about his future. He is known to put his foot in his mouth, but this was different. Rose is not a free agent until 2017, but was pretty keen on making it known that the almighty dollar was his primary concern coming into the season. He keeps reiterating that he wants to make sure his family and son are financially secure -- and one would hope they already are after being guaranteed $300 million by the Bulls and Adidas alone in his career. Coming into a season where you need to prove yourself, Rose probably shouldn't bring up the topic that he thinks he should be paid more, especially when you consider the Bulls return on investment with him the past few injury riddled seasons. </p>

<p>When asked about these comments, Butler <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/ct-smack-rosenbloom-spt-0930-20150929-story.html">seemed undeterred</a> about Rose's mindset. "He could talk about unicorns and rainbows for all I care," Butler said during the first team's practice on Sept.29. "Just help us win games.''</p>

<p>Fred Hoiberg should address the situation, real or imagined, and squash the rumors before anything happens that could send the situation farther down the rabbit hole. Many will say that team chemistry means nothing, but over 82 games it sure does help. For the Bulls to succeed in the coming year, both Rose and Butler will need to compromise about who runs the show. Barring any major setbacks, Rose will be at full steam this season and Butler will hope to equal the stats he put up last year when everyone was saying "Derrick who?" They are not the only two players on the roster, but they are the cogs to success for this incarnation of the Chicago Bulls.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Bears" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/bears_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />One could spend hours dissecting mistake after mistake that Phil Emery made as general manager of the Bears. It would be days had he been around as long as Jerry Angelo was, but in just three years, Emery took a middling team on the brink of the playoffs and slammed the organization straight into the septic tank.</p>

<p>The Bears are the worst team in the NFL because of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/draft.htm">multiple, consecutive, failed drafts</a>. Nearly a decade's worth of players drafted with such high expectations are either on another team or gone from football completely. Ryan Pace knew this coming in, and he's doing whatever he possibly can to turn the page.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Bears dealt free agent bust Jared Allen and second-round flop Jon Bostic, to Carolina and New England respectively, for a pair of sixth-round picks. Both are 4-3 players trying to fake it in a 3-4 scheme (or, if you're Bostic, just trying to actually participate in a football game), and the Bears should be thrilled to get anything for them.</p>
        <p>For Carolina, they're hoping that a return to an ultra-aggressive four linemen scheme can revitalize the aging Allen. He goes from being counted on as a team leader to just needing to be the seventh or eighth best player on their defense -- a perfect transition and situation for him to succeed. Don't be surprised if he becomes a passing down ace on a team where he doesn't need to play all the time. They'll owe him almost no money this season, and can cut him with no financial repercussions at any time. </p>

<p>The Patriots getting Bostic on the field would constitute a success for them. He's been hurt throughout all of 2015 (the year, not just the football season), and it's been a theme of his professional career. When he has made it onto the field, he's played out of position at middle linebacker, and played poorly at his more natural Will linebacker spot by consistently filling the wrong gaps and biting on all play action fakes. Maybe all he needs is the right coaching to figure things out, but it's far safer to bet that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>It seems like Pace is now on a mission to rid his team of players who don't fit into future plans. It's smart of him to do as much in year one as he can, because new GMs usually have carte blanche to do just about anything. Expectations for 2015 were basically knee high after the Kevin White injury, and it would be a major surprise to exceed them after a laughable start to the season.</p>

<p>The next best bet to go is Willie Young, another 2014 free agent darling who was supposed to make the Bears' pass rush dangerous last season. Young tore his Achilles tendon toward the end of the season, but made a full recovery in time to make the team as an attempted outside linebacker convert. It hasn't taken, and he was a healthy scratch against Seattle. He might fetch a similar price as Allen for a defensive end-needy 4-3 team looking for some speed on the edge.</p>

<p>Another name that is likely to spring up right away in trade rumors is Matt Forte. He's in the final year of his deal, and will turn 30 at year's end. Despite the near universally accepted concept that you don't sign running backs whose age begins with a three, Forte remains one of the most dangerous and versatile backs in the league. He's able to avoid most head-on collisions because of his underrated shiftiness, and catches the ball out of the backfield better than anyone in football.</p>

<p>Moving Forte would shock most Bears fans, but the new regime has prepared for this day by drafting Jeremy Langford and the signing of Jacquizz Rodgers. If they're able to get value in return, they won't think twice about dealing one of the best running backs of the last decade. A top-flight running back on a largely talent-less team is an unnecessary luxury. This team needs lottery tickets on draft day and as much ammunition to add or trade up to get players they're targeting as they can get. </p>

<p>When the phone rings at Halas Hall, everyone is now available.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Bears" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/bears_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />The worst kept secret in Chicago was revealed when the Bears lined up in pregame warmups against the Packers last Sunday. Instead of being sandwiched between Will Montgomery and Charles Leno, All-Pro right guard Kyle Long slid out to play right tackle in an effort to solidify a spot that has plagued the Bears' offensive line the last two seasons.</p>

<p>With Jordan Mills cut and Leno struggling mightily, John Fox was mum on Long's role the entire week leading into the Bears opener. Though the coach probably thought keeping the lineup card a secret would afford his team some minimal advantage, he was grossly mistaken. Taking the best player on your team and moving him to a position he's never played in live action before is more damaging than tricking the opponent.</p>
        <p>But the Bears aren't moving Long to the outside to make today's team better. The most talented player on the roster is moving to a position that's far more valuable. Right tackles protect the quarterback from freakish athletes lining up at defensive end, and also can be road graders on stretches and sweeps to the right side. Leno wasn't the long-term answer, so why not try someone who might be? If it doesn't work out, Long can always slide back inside.</p>

<p>The move goes deeper than that though. Despite a solid grade against the Packers, left tackle Jermon Bushrod isn't anywhere near 100 percent. A bad back has been plaguing him, and at his height and weight, it's something that's unlikely to get better as long as playing in the NFL is his profession. He's also 31, and the Bears could save $4.3 million in cap space if they cut him during the offseason (though they're currently looking at a mindboggling $50 million in cap space next spring).</p>

<p>After ranking as the league's fifth-worst tackle in week one according to Pro Football Focus, Long has a ways to go to become a quality anchor on the outside. He was raw when he came into the NFL, but quickly turned himself into a Pro Bowl guard. The ascension may never happen at tackle, or it may not be quick, but if he can hone his immense talent, Bears GM Ryan Pace might have found Jay Cutler's blindside protector right on his own team.</p>

<p>This Sunday's matchup should provide a slightly easier transition game for Long as he'll face guys like Frostee Rucker and an over-the-hill Lamar Woodley instead of the amazingly agile and powerful Julius Peppers on most downs. Don't expect a dominating performance. Just hope that you see improvement over the next eight weeks, and the Bears find a more valuable spot for their MVP.</p>

The White Sox came into the season with high expectations and the club has been one of the league's biggest disappointments. This seems to be the Sox MO the past few years and it may be time to give the kids a shot. Pumping in some talent from the farm could give the club a shot in the arm and give them a better idea of what direction to go next year.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of September, clubs are allowed to call up a few players from their minor league teams to pad their lineup. Sometimes this is a good time to give starters a rest if they have a comfortable lead in their division or give rookies a shot at the big leagues if the playoffs are not attainable. The White Sox are in the latter of this discussion and this month could provide some options heading into the offseason. Hopefully they have a contingency plan because coming into the year, their farm system <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/majors/2015-organization-talent-rankings/">ranked 20th in the league</a>, according to Baseball America, but is a step up from 2013's abysmal ranking of 29th. The team has already called up one prospect, who has been a stud so far and has made the call for four other guys. The jury is still out if these kids can play.</p>

<h3><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/thomptr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Trayce Thompson</a> (OF, Age 26, Selected 61st Overall in the 2009 MLB Draft)</h3>

<p>Thompson wasn't exactly lighting it up down at Triple-A Charlotte. In 104 games with the Knights, the outfielder had a mediocre slash line of .260/.304/.441. That's why his promotion to the big club came with a whole bunch of shrugs and people saying "oh that's Klay Thompson's brother." The team was pretty much out of the playoff race by the time he was called, so general manager Rick Hahn was probably thinking 'what the hell?' But since coming to the big league roster on August 3rd, Thompson has been on a tear in limited play. He's hitting .408 and has an OPS of 1.167 in only 23 games. Plus he has hit a few homers, which has <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/142570996/trayce-thompson-hits-first-career-home-run">won the admiration of his teammates</a>. Expectations are not very high for the 24-year-old and he has surprisingly surpassed the little he had. Thompson may get a spot start and an opportunity to pinch run here and there, but won't be setting the world on fire.</p>

<p>The White Sox currently have three of their top five prospects on the big league club. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodonca01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Carlos Rodon</a> has had some growing pains with his 3.94 ERA, but has found a groove over his last few starts. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnsmi04.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Micah Johnson</a> was heralded as the second baseman of the future, but that was before his .267 average and shoddy defense got him sent down to Triple-A. Both of these players have had different results, so it will be interesting how number five ranked prospect Frankie Montas will do. The youngster was pretty good at Double-A Birmingham as a starter, posting a 2.97 ERA in 23 starts and 108 strikeouts. But those stats may be a bit deceiving as his walk rate was <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=14309&position=P">hitting 10.3 percent</a> for the Barons, according to Fangraphs. Not necessarily the control you want to see from a hopeful future ace, but it isn't time to abandon ship on Montas just yet, as he is still quite young. </p>

<h3><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/garcile02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Leury Garcia</a> (UTL, Age 24, <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/08/rangers-acquire-alex-rios.html">PTBNL in 2013 Alex Rios Trade</a>)</h3>

<p>You never think too much about a player who is acquired in the process of dumping another. That is the case with Leury Garcia. The Dominican-born utility man was the player to be named later in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/riosal01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Alex Rios</a> trade in 2013 and has been nestled in Charlotte for quite some time. Garcia has become a jack of all trades in the minors, playing all outfield positions, a few starts on the dirt and has backed up his durability with a decent offensive showing of a .298 average and 19 doubles. While he may not be swinging an intimidating bat, Garcia could be a nice bat off the bench.</p>

<h3><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brantro01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Rob Brantly</a> (C, Age 26, Claimed Off Waivers from Marlins in 2014)</h3>

<p>You can never have too many catchers, especially if your team has two of them who are flirting with the Mendoza Line. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/flowety01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Tyler Flowers</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sotoge01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Geovany Soto</a> have been pretty good in calling games for pitchers, but you could basically pluck anyone out of obscurity who could hit better than them. Well, the White Sox did that with Rob Brantly and they may have to keep searching. The 26-year-old was a waiver pick up over the winter from the Marlins and was hit and miss down on the farm. Between Double-A and Triple-A, Brantly hit a respectable .310, but his on base percentage of .335 is a little underwhelming. If he can call a game as good as his counterparts, then he will fit in just fine.</p>

<p>Some September call ups are constantly trying to prove to the front office that they deserve a spot on the main roster. They may kill it in the minors or during spring training, showing coaches that they deserve a roster spot, but sometimes their success in tryouts won't translate to the show. That is the case with Erik Johnson. The right-hander has been called up by the Sox before, but has never seemed to have any prolonged success. In 2013, Johnson made a case to stay in the rotation by going 3-2 and having a 3.25 ERA in five starts. That was enough to punch his ticket to the big leagues in 2014, but his earned run average ballooned to 6.46. Johnson didn't let it deter him as he took his demotion in stride and bounced back in 2015 by going 11-8 and striking out 136 batters in 132.2 innings pitched for Charlotte. We'll see if Johnson can earn his way back into a permanent spot in the rotation, but it's a little dicey so far as he gave up three earned runs during six innings pitched during a start on September 6. There's still a whole month of baseball left to play and Johnson could try to impress the White Sox brass again. It would be nice to see a righty in the rotation instead of five left-handers in the coming year.<br />

        <p><img alt="Chicago Cubs" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/cubs_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />In his short time since becoming manager, Joe Maddon has made quite the impression with the Chicago Cubs fanbase and the city of Chicago. The team has defied expectations and is in contention for the playoffs, way ahead of schedule. And if the recent <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/13547782/chicago-cubs-wear-pajamas-flight-back-chicago">pajamas day</a> after Jake Arrieta's no-hitter is any indication, the team is having a whole lot of fun along the way.</p>

<p>But Maddon's reach has extended beyond the clubhouse, as he likes to give back to the community with various charity events. One of those events will be occurring Thursday, Sept. 3 at Wrigley Field. The Cubs manager and his wife Jaye will be hosting a "Spoxing for Charity" event from 10am to 4pm inside Gate F at the Friendly Confines. This unique sport has become that latest trend in the fitness world.</p>
        <p>"Spoxing, the nation's newest fitness craze, is a group class which uniquely combines spinning and boxing, with a warm-up on stationary spin bikes followed by a heavy bag and boxing glove workout," <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/community/charities/popup.jsp">according to a Cubs press release</a>.</p>

<p>The event will also be sponsored by Epic Boxing and Fitness, Chicago's Fitness Formula and Everlast, who will be providing supplies for those that purchase tickets. Participants will be getting their own boxing wraps, protein bar, water and a workout towel from Epic Boxing and Fitness. Proceeds from the event will be going to Joe Maddon's Respect 90 Foundation, a charity that gives Chicago's inner city young adults and children chances to develop their sports skills and to start engagement among the community.</p>

<p>Tickets are priced at $30 and there are classes scheduled for 10am, 11am, noon (sold out), 2pm and 3pm.<br />

        <p><img alt="Chicago Cubs" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/cubs_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />Long-term injuries suck at any time during a competitive season, but they hurt even more when the Cubs are weeks away from potentially securing their first playoff appearance since 2008.</p>

<p>I've been in the extreme minority <a href="https://twitter.com/chadruter/status/622889160378966016" target="_blank">believing that Jorge Soler will eventually be the best hitter</a> out of the Soler, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bryankr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kris Bryant</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/schwaky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Kyle Schwarber</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/russead02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Addison Russell</a> group. And who knows, ten years from now we may be laughing at how we ever thought the other youngsters were better than him, but it's going to be awfully difficult for Soler to eclipse his teammates when he's on the disabled all the time.</p>

<p>The oblique injury Soler suffered on a throw during Sunday's series finale against Atlanta will lay him up for at least a month, and possibly for the season depending on the severity. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lasteto01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Tommy La Stella</a> suffered the same injury in April, and he's now just returning to the majors after a major setback during rehab.</p>
        <p>During the Cubs' 17-4 streak concluding with Sunday afternoon's win, Soler was solid in the batter's box, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=solerjo01&t=b&year=2015&share=1.04#94-114-sum:batting_gamelogs">slashing .280/.360/.373</a> with 14 RBI's. He did most of the damage out of the sixth and seventh spots in the lineup, so he wasn't being heavily leaned on, but he was contributing nonetheless. Unfortunately, his defense was about the same as it <a href="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/2015/08/optimizing_the_cubs_defense/">had been much of the season: lousy</a>.</p>

<p>With Soler hitting the DL, Tommy La Stella gets the call back to Wrigley for the first time since he went down with his own oblique issue. The swap of another right-handed bat for a lefty might look a little scary if this was May, but with roster expansion just a week away, the Cubs can get away being tilted one direction for a few days. In fact, it may even improve their recently robust offense.</p>

<p>La Stella is known for his on-base and contact skills. He'll slide in as the every day second basemen against righties, with <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/castrst01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Starlin Castro</a> platooning when a southpaw is on the mound. La Stella will likely man the ninth spot in the order when Russell returns from his groin injury that's left him day-to-day, and it fits the skill set that <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maddojo99.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Joe Maddon</a> likes having in the "second leadoff" position.</p>

<p>It also allows <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/coghlch01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Chris Coghlan</a> to move back to the outfield without having to remove Kyle Schwarber from the lineup. Coghlan playing right field every day might scare some people, but he's actually <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=lf&stats=fld&lg=all&qual=y&type=1&season=2015&month=0&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0">ranked as one of the best left fielders defensively in 2015</a>, which is a huge leap from what he's done in the outfield in past seasons. He won't be <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/heywaja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Jason Heyward</a> out in right, but he'll do a far better job than Soler in keeping base runners from taking extra bases on balls that get past him.</p>

<p>Coghlan wasn't great at second base, and it was never intended to be the long-term solution. It was Maddon's way of keeping his best hitting lineup on the field for the majority of the game, and then make defensive substitutions late. Tally that up as a major success for the mad scientist.</p>

<p>La Stella was a middle-of-the-pack defender at second base last year, and that's just fine if he can get on base at a .350 clip like the Cubs are hoping for. His defense will be a significant upgrade over Coghlan, and that's all you can ask for.</p>

<p>As for the lineup being too heavily left-handed, it's actually a good thing against right-handed starters. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=0&type=1&season=2015&month=14&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0,ts&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&sort=15,d">Against righties, the Cubs are 16th in the league</a> with a .312 weighted on-base average. If you narrow the results down to how left-handed hitting Cubs are faring against righties, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=0&type=1&season=2015&month=58&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0,ts&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&sort=15,d">they jump to seventh with a .337 wOBA</a>. But what about when teams turn to those dreaded left-handed relievers, won't that neutralize what the Cubs are doing? Not so fast. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=0&type=1&season=2015&month=57&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0,ts&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&sort=15,d">Cubs lefties are third in the league</a> with a .349 wOBA against southpaw hurlers.</p>

<p>Even if that becomes an issue, the Cubs will have plenty of right-handed firepower off the bench in the coming days. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/baezja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Javier Baez</a> has mashed lefties to the tune of .329/.397/.586 in Triple-A this year, Matt Sczcur has a .794 OPS against lefties in his major league career (albeit, in 56 plate appearances). And don't forget about <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/denorch01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Chris Denorfia</a>, who was specifically signed to platoon with Coghlan in left field and <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statsplits.aspx?playerid=4400&position=OF&season=0&split=0.3">sports a career 341 wOBA against lefties</a>. The rarely discussed <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=villan001chr&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-gapersblock.com">Christian Villanueva</a> rakes against them too.</p>

<p>The Cubs will be improved defensively with their refurbished lineup minus Soler, and they might even benefit from stacking a sixth lefty in the starting lineup against right-handers. Hopefully Soler can recover in time for a possible playoff berth, but in the meantime, the Cubs should be able to hold the fort down while he recovers.</p>

        <p><img alt="Chicago Bears" src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/bears_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="left" />Three games into the 2014 regular season, everyone thought the Bears were on track to having a Pro Bowl cornerback. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FullKy00.htm">Kyle Fuller</a> was playing fast and instinctive, and making former GM Phil Emery look brilliant for scoring big in the first round of two consecutive drafts. Unfortunately, the level of play Fuller showed against San Francisco and New York didn't last.</p>

<p>Over the remainder of the season, Fuller struggled mightily. Pro Football Focus graded him positively in just two games following his magnificent weeks two and three, and those came against and Atlanta team that dropped a ton of passes, and a Minnesota team that lacked anything resembling a playmaker at wide receiver. Fuller finished as the second-worst corner in the NFL.</p>
        <p>Everyone's hope was that it was poor coaching on the part of Mel Tucker; that Vic Fangio could come in and get him playing like he did in the early parts of 2014. Maybe he just needs more time, but the early results are not good so far in the preseason.</p>

<p>In the limited time the first team defense has gotten in live action, Fuller has done a nice job in helping with the run, but hasn't looked like the number one corner the Bears were hoping they had. Instead, he's looking more like a guy who you hope can cover slot receivers and set the edge if the opposing offense runs out of passing formations.</p>

<p>Fuller was beaten badly twice in Saturday night's game against Indianapolis. The big play came early in the second quarter in man coverage against T.Y. Hilton, who<a href="http://www.colts.com/videos/videos/Andrew_Luck_throws_45yard_pass_to_wide_receiver_TY_Hilton/9a3e4169-e4df-40cd-8580-0d79911c86f7"> burned Fuller on a simple post route</a> for a 45-yard game. To make matters worse, Fuller kept himself tangled up with Hilton after the play, and picked up a 15-yard taunting penalty for his trouble. The gain eventually led to the only Colts touchdown of the game.</p>

<p>On the next Colts possession, Andrew Luck once again picked on Fuller, but this time on the other end of the spectrum. With Fuller playing off the line of scrimmage, Luck fired a one-step bullet out to rookie WR Phillip Dorsett, who juked Fuller out of his shoes and picked up eight yards. The cardinal sin of trying to stop someone one-on-one with space between you is to stop your feet, and that's exactly what Fuller did.</p>

<p>The sophomore corner is inching closer to losing confidence in himself simply because he hasn't had anything go right for him on the football field recently. He needs to focus on being physical and not allowing receivers space to do their work. Any time the guy he's covering separates himself, Fuller's done. Being in the receivers face at the point of attack may get him beat from time to time, but it'll also put him in position to make some of the big plays Bears fans got used to seeing at the beginning of his rookie season.</p>

<p>A leap back up to being a top flight corner isn't necessary to justify where Fuller was selected, but steady improvement over the final two preseason games and early in the 2015 regular season are going to be incredibly important for his long-term future. Perpetually losing one-on-one matchups can't last forever, because a new coaching staff with no prior connection will put you on the bench if they can't trust you.</p>

        <p><img src="http://gapersblock.com/tailgate/bulls_200.jpg" alt="Bulls" height="200" width="200" class="left" />Like opening up gifts on Christmas Day, the release of the NBA schedule is an anticipated day for all basketball fans. This year's excitement was a bit different than year's past because of the crazy offseason that occurred. There was plenty of hype for each top free agent, but the brunt of the signings were done after the first day of free agency.</p>

<p>That whirlwind period was pretty exciting for basketball fans, but it came and went in a snap. That is why this year's <a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls/schedule">schedule unveiling</a> had many fans waiting on pins and needles to see who the Bulls were going to play. This year's schedule offers some exciting new opponents and rematches with heated rivals. Here are a few games to set your DVR for.</p>
        <h3>Oct. 27 vs. Cleveland Cavaliers</h3>

<p>Not only will the Bulls' first game of the season be a home game, but they will also be squaring off against the Cavaliers on NBA Opening Night. If you think there was pressure for this year's team going into the season, then the bright lights of the national spotlight could have the Bulls sweating. That may not deter the team as last year's duel between the two squads was a slobberknocker, with the Cavs coming out on top 114-108 at the United Center.</p>

<p>The Bulls we're running on fumes during their playoff series with the Cavs last year, so that wasn't the best representation of their talent. It will be interesting to see how the team plays with new coach Fred Hoiberg -- or as our friends at Blog a Bull have so delightfully called <a href="http://www.blogabull.com/2015/8/10/9108725/fred-hoiberg-offense-chicago-bulls-derrick-rose-video">Hoiball</a>. The Bulls want their offensive style to be quicker and more intense in the early going, but the team isn't really comprised of spring chickens anymore. Hopefully they won't get burnt out too early in the season.</p>

<h3>Nov. 7 vs. Minnesota Timberwolves</h3>

<p>The showdown with the Timberwolves may not equal the same number of TV viewership as the Cavs game, but it will be a showcase of the top young talent in the league. Minnesota has stockpiled a surplus of young superstars on their roster. Their starting lineup will include this year's number one overall pick, Karl-Anthony Towns, former number one pick Anthony Bennett and reigning Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins. Don't expect this to be a slaughter by the Bulls, as the Timberwolves are much better this year. Get ready for an absolute clinic in basketball with this matchup.</p>

<h3>"Circus Trip" Nov. 18-27</h3>

<p>It has been a yearly tradition that the Bulls head out West when the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus come to town. It's not necessarily a tradition so much as a necessity. I doubt the United Center's top-notch crew could clean up the mess left by the elephants in time for a game. Opponents for this go-around include the Phoenix Suns on Nov. 18, the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 20, the Portland Trail Blazers on Nov. 24 and the Indiana Pacers on Nov. 27. This year's trip should much easier than any they've experienced in the past decade, as they are not playing any back-to-back games and have two days of rest in between each of the last three games.</p>

<h3>Dec 25 at Oklahoma City Thunder</h3>

<p>Nothing brings more holiday cheer than sitting down and taking in a basketball game. The Bulls and Thunder are the second showdown on the Christmas Day docket with a scheduled 1:30pm tip off. Coming at this game from an objective and analyst perspective, I'll say that it be a combative game packed with plenty drives to the paint and last minute jumpers. Seeing Russell Westbrook, Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler and hopefully a healthy Kevin Durant square off is just too good to pass up. Forget the presents and eggnog, you should be hunkering down to watch this classic.</p>
