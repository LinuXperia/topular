<p>The new law, effective from 1<sup>st</sup> January, 2016, makes it necessary for employers to pay equal wages to employees of different genders if they are engaged in ‘substantially similar work’, irrespective of their locations. ‘Substantially similar work’ implies a composite mix of efforts, skills, and responsibilities performed in similar work conditions. In 2014, the wage comparison of women to men stood at 84 cents to 1 dollar; the gap existed across all occupations in the state of California.</p>
<p>Some people believe this new regulation on California businesses, on top of the already mounting regulations pouring in from the nation’s capital, will just harm businesses even more. Will this just push more businesses out of California and to lower tax and more business friendly states? Well, that is another story. There is no doubt that anyone, regardless of gender, if they produce the same amount of work on a daily basis, should be paid the same.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics of the New Law</strong></p>
<p>Employers can justify wage differentials in their companies by clearly differentiating between the wage calculations of employees on the basis of factors other than their gender. Such factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>A well-defined and documented system of seniority</li>
<li>A well-defined and documented procedure of merit</li>
<li>A wage calculation system based on quantity or quality of production</li>
<li>Bona fide factors such as experience, training background, and educational qualifications</li>
</ol>
<p>Any employer depending on specific bona fide factors of wage differentiation will have the responsibility of proving that the factor itself is not derived from gender differentiation, and is directly related with the job and designation in question, and is a factor relevant to the business. Also, the factors cited by the employer must justify the entire wage differential, if any. Also, the new law makes it mandatory for employers to keep a record of wage rates, wages, terms and conditions of employment, job classifications, for 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>Empowerment for Employees</strong></p>
<p>Although the new Equal Pay Act does not make it mandatory for employers to disclose wages, it has provisions to empower employees to make the most of the act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Employers should not prohibit or reprimand their employers from disclosing their own wages, discussing wages of their colleagues, questioning about wages of other employees, or encouraging others to do the same.</li>
<li>Employers should not discriminate or retaliate against employees based on actions taken by employees to invoke or take assistance from the extended Fair Pay Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Employers</strong></p>
<p>The extended act will make employers more vulnerable to lawsuits from aggrieved employees, unless they proactively endorse the suggestions above to steer clear of trouble. Here are some steps that employers in California can take to be on the safe side of California’s new Equal Pay Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review job descriptions, job titles, compensation records, and identify potential situations of pay differentials for similar work. Since the new law looks beyond job titles, it’s important for employers to fine tune job descriptions to avoid overlaps and similarities of work in different job titles.</li>
<li>Employers need to carefully examine perks and incentives such as stock options, commissions, over time, bonuses, and fringe benefits, because any investigations associated with Fair Pay Act lawsuits will consider such salary components.</li>
<li>Update your compensation policies to clearly declare that as an employer, you do not endorse any gender based discrimination in pay structures, and are committed to the tenets of the extended Fair Pay Act. Train supervisors and leaders to understand and abide by the provisions of the law while designing performance appraisals and pay hikes.</li>

Employers that are governed by the jurisdiction of California can ill afford taking their eyes and minds off the changing legal environment of workforce and workplace laws.</p>
<p>With the Assembly Bill 987 Section 1(A), a request for reasonable accommodation, based on disability of religion, is treated as protected activity (under Section 12940) of the Government Code), which means that anybody making such a request is protected against any retaliation measures taken by the employer. Here’s more on this important amendment to the integral Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) of California.</p>
<p><u>Disability and Religious Accommodation Requests are ‘Protected’ against Retaliation</u></p>
<p>The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) of California has been protecting the interests of citizens, protecting characteristics ranging from veteran status to disability, and from family status to sexual orientations. From 1<sup>st</sup> January, 2016, the scope of the law has been extended; any request for accommodation will now be protected as provided by the extended version of the law.</p>
<p>The amendment prohibits any discrimination and retaliation against employee requesting accommodation on grounds of disability or religious beliefs. This protection extends to the employee irrespective of whether the accommodation request is granted or not.</p>
<p><u>What does the amendment mean?</u></p>
<p>To put things into perspective, here’s an example. If a person who is not disabled, but puts in a request for disability accommodation, he/she will be protected by the updated version of FEHA. The organization and authorities will need to conduct a fair and intensive inquiry into whether the person’s request can be honored or not.</p>
<p>Plus, there can be no retaliation against the requester, because the same shall be covered as ‘protected’ under the ambit of the new FEHA. The amendment is an attempt to offer clarity on the holding of the much talked about <em>Rope v. Auto-Clor Sys. of Washington, Inc.</em>, 220 Cal. App. 4<sup>th</sup> 635 (2013) decision.</p>
<p><u>More Protection for Whistleblowers</u></p>
<p>Also, California’s workplace legal environment is changing in context of whistleblower protection. With the Assembly Bill 1509, anti-retaliation measures for whistleblowers are now extended. The updated law dissuades employers from indulging in any discrimination against employees, if they engage in any whistle-blowing activity. The nature of activities protected under the law also encompasses complaints made about unsafe working conditions and wage theft.</p>
<p><u>More from AB1509</u></p>
<p>With AB1509’s provisions, employers are prohibited from discriminating against any employee even if the whistle-blowing act has been committed by one of family members of the employee. Also, the protection extends to contractual employees who might not be on the payroll of the employer. AB1509 provides for amendments to Labor Code section 98.6, 1102.5, 2810.3, and 6310. The provisions of the bill also exempt household goods carriers from employer, client, and labor liability provisions of the law.</p>

<p>This law furthers California’s reputation as a state with worker-friendly legislation and also puts employers on their heels in terms of their responsibility to comply with the updated law.</p>
<p><u>The Question of ‘Who’s Exempt, and Who isn’t?’</u></p>
<p>In California’s workplace compensation regulation environment, the Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) has a key role to play. The IWC regulates work hours, wages, work conditions, and formulates wage orders for different industries to define as to which employees can be treated as ‘exempt’. An exempt employee is earns a fixed salary independent of how many hours he/she works.</p>
<p>The implications for employers – they don’t need to remunerate such employees in terms of any overtime compensation, nor are they liable to provide any rest or meal breaks or adhere to any other wage requirements for these employees.</p>
<p><u>Some Numbers to Bring Clarity</u></p>
<p>As per wage orders applicable in California, an employee must earn twice the state’s minimum wage to qualify as an exempt employee. Now, with the minimum wage figures changing, the criteria for employers to treat certain employees under administrative, executive, or professional exemption also change. From the 1<sup>st</sup> of January, 2016, the minimum salary levels for employees in California have increased to $970 per week, which calculates to $41,600. Any employee earning less than this amount will fall out of the exempt category, making them eligible for overtime remuneration.</p>
<p><u>State versus Federal Law</u></p>
<p>Here’s another aspect that makes the change in the minimum wages law even more complicated for employers to comprehend. The proposed federal salary threshold to define the line between exempt and non-exempt employees is $50,440.</p>
<p>This means that despite of the increase in minimum wages in California, employees in the state could still be non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and will hence continue to qualify for overtime wages as per federal minimum salary threshold. In case of any contradictions or overlaps between the local and federal laws, employers in California are required to comply with laws that favor the employee.</p>
<p><u>This means that in 2016</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Employees earning less than $41,600 annually will be eligible for overtime payments under California law.</li>
<li>Employees earning more than $41,600 but less than $50,440 annually will also qualify for weekly overtime payments because of being nonexempt as per federal minimum wage levels.</li>
<li>Employees earning more than $50,440 will be exempt, and hence, employers will not have to pay overtime to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year could spell tough times for employers in California, with a slew of workplace, workforce, and wage laws being updated.  These wage laws have taken effect already, if you have not seen your wages reflect the new laws, call Makarem &amp; Associates at 310-312-0299 or email info@makaremlaw.com.

On the 6<sup>th</sup> of October 2015 the California Fair Pay Act was signed by Governor Brown, which means that from the 1<sup>st</sup> of Jan 2016, employees can file lawsuits against employers for getting lower wages than their peers performing similar work, irrespective of the physical location where the work is performed.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the California Fair Pay Act so important?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It enforces equal pay between genders for “substantially similar” work explained under certain defined parameters.</li>
<li>It demands bona fide explanation for differential pay among gender groups which hold under limited and narrow circumstances.</li>
<li>Shifts the responsibility to employer to explain any unequal pay.</li>
<li>It gives the right to employees to request the complete payment and compensation information of fellow employees.</li>
<li>Protects the privacy of employees and prevents acts against the requester.</li>
<li>The period for which records of wage rates, wages, job classifications has to be stored is increased from 2 to 3 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is not covered by the California Fair Pay Act?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It cannot force an employer to disclose any wage information to an employee on his/her request.</li>
<li>It does require the employers to pay any compensation if they justify their payment disparity between two candidates with “substantially similar” work by educational qualification, experience, or training among the concerned employees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the California Fair Pay Act enforced?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Employee(s) can file complaints with the Division of Labor Standard Enforcements or DLSE for any defiance of equal pay. Investigations are carried on while maintaining the privacy of the supposed victim – this is a priority.</li>
<li>Civil action can be pursued by the DLSE on behalf of the employee(s).</li>
<li>The remedy is usually the amount by which he/she/they were underpaid and an equal amount in case the violation is found to be willful.</li>
<li>If employee(s) is unsatisfied with results of DLSE investigation he/she/they may proceed to bring a civil action to recover the payment shortfall.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the must-do’s for all employers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove redundancy in post description, job responsibility, and work output among multiple job titles/strata of pay. However the factors which define “substantially similar” work are still unclear under the new California Fair Pay Act.</li>
<li>Compare and compensate employees with similar job responsibilities, similar work, effort, and so on which are performed under comparable working conditions. The compensation includes making up for the salary shortfall as well as including the bonus, interests, equity grants, and so forth.</li>
<li>Establish a:
<ul>
<li>Seniority system</li>
<li>Merit system</li>
<li>Job related factors such as educational qualifications, experience, training, etc which are relevant to business consistency and quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is especially necessary if you notice a considerable gender difference in the payroll categories of your establishment. These are a few bona fide factors which can be stated as explanations to rule out gender related discrimination.</p>

<p>While there are some circumstances in which an organization may have no choice but to suddenly dismiss an employee, it&#8217;s important to be aware of which situations classify the motion as an &#8220;unfair dismissal.&#8221; As an employer, most companies and organizations retain the right to dismiss their employees as and when they choose, so long as they can provide a reasonable and fair explanation of why the dismissal is taking place, and the dismissal itself follows &#8220;fair guidelines&#8221; for procedure.</p>
<p><strong>What Constitutes Fair and Unfair Dismissal?</strong></p>
<p>There is a marvelous deal of legal guidance and advice available today in regards to what can be classed as fair reason and procedure in employment dismissal. For instance, the group known as &#8220;ACAS&#8221; &#8211; The advisory, conciliation, and arbitration service, have published a guidebook that offer employees a general idea of the correct procedure to follow when they are faced with the last-resort action of dismissing an employee or employees.</p>
<p>Although the ACAS code is not enforced to a legal standard, most employment tribunals will take into account the effort an employer has made in following the given guidelines when they are determining if a dismissal is &#8220;unfair&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Circumstances for Automatically Unfair Dismissal</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the perceived &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; of a situation, certain circumstances cause dismissals to be automatically classed as unfair. In these instances, a case can typically be brought against the employer in question with the help of an employment litigation lawyer. Circumstances in which dismissal can be considered automatically unfair may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dismissing a woman because of pregnancy or reasons regarding maternity</li>
<li>Dismissal as a result of an employee joining a trade union</li>
<li>Dismissing employees that fail to work within conditions that display significant breaches of health and safety rules</li>
<li>Dismissing employees that have been &#8220;whistleblowing&#8221;</li>
<li>Dismissing individuals who take leave due to family reasons or emergency situations</li>
<li>Dismissals based on the fact that the employee is currently a part-time worker</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list is just some of the circumstances in which a dismissal may be considered automatically unfair, and often employees are advised to speak to a specialist attorney about their situation if they feel they may be eligible to begin a case of employment litigation. If a company dismisses any employee unfairly, it could be subject to litigation. What&#8217;s more, if a business deviates from the law in dismissing an employee, that employee could be entitled to a compensatory award.</p>
