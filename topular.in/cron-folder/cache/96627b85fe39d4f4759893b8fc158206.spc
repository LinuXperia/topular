That is, events where you run, then bike, then run again. I did <a href="http://eri-thon.blogspot.com/2011/06/race-around-world-duathlon-race-report.html" target="_blank">my first duathlon</a> in 2011 and a few more after that. I entertained the thought of doing a triathlon but I figured that duathlons would be easier since there's no swimming.

Well, in the past three weeks I've gotten to test out that theory after doing <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/2015/06/my-first-triathlon-esprit-de-she-naperville/" target="_blank">my first triathlon</a>. So, which is easier, a duathlon or a triathlon?

I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I actually think the triathlon was easier.

Wait, non-swimmers, hear me out!

The swim isn't easy by any means, but let me break down the duathlon for you.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/11700532_10152851138422035_7678647822797550439_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1342" alt="11700532_10152851138422035_7678647822797550439_o" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/11700532_10152851138422035_7678647822797550439_o-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>The Tinley Park Duathlon starts with a two mile run. This year they had the men start at 8 AM, the women start at 8:03ish and the relay teams at 8:05 or so. The run is an out and back with some shade the middle but none at the beginning and end.

The first run can be difficult to gauge. How fast should I go? Will it be difficult to bike if I run too hard? How much fuel should I take in, if any?

In a triathlon, with the swim, even though learning to swim is tough and the swim itself can be nerve-wracking, you're not really going to tire out your quads or hamstrings or glutes in the first leg of the event. At least, not if you swim mostly with your arms the way I do.

After you finish your run, it's time to change into your bike shoes (if you have different ones like I do). The first year I did the Tinley Park Duathlon I didn't have clipless pedals so I just wore the same shoes for all three legs. This time I had to slip off my sneakers, put on socks, and put on my bike shoes. I strangely had fewer issues putting on my socks and shoes after the swim at the triathlon than I did after running at the du. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/10999326_10152851138432035_6151747563470419876_o.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1339" alt="10999326_10152851138432035_6151747563470419876_o" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/10999326_10152851138432035_6151747563470419876_o-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>

Then it's off on the bike for 11 miles of rolling hills. I decided that I was going to go all out on the bike and just see what that did to me on the run. At about mile 6 of the bike I got passed by a woman for the first time and decided to do my best to keep up with her. In the end, my average bike pace was 19.5 MPH, the fastest I've ever biked during a race when I was going to have to run afterwards.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/11039241_10152851138482035_5224373504993789738_o-e1435672681848.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1340" alt="11039241_10152851138482035_5224373504993789738_o" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/11039241_10152851138482035_5224373504993789738_o-e1435672681848-300x259.jpg" width="300" height="259" /></a>And speaking of that running afterwards, well, let's just say that on the triathlon my run pace was sub-8:00 minute miles. My second two mile run pace at Tinley Park? Barely below 9:00 minutes per mile. Oof. I felt like I was moving through sand. My legs felt heavy. I was tired. Interestingly, I didn't feel any of those things at the triathlon just a few weeks before.

There are probably a ton of other factors at play here, but based on comparing these two events I still stand by my assertion that a triathlon is easier.

As a nice counterbalance, how about a post on something I am good at?

You know, it's actually a little bit difficult to write about something you're really good at without trying to be humble. I can come up with all sorts of things that I'm average at (running marathons, biking, cooking dinner, doing household chores) but picking one thing I'm really good at? It's tough. But here goes nothing.

I'm actually really good at weightlifting.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-24-at-9.12.57-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1331" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-24 at 9.12.57 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-24-at-9.12.57-PM-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>I remember back in high school we had a segment in P.E. on weight lifting. At the time I could barely bench press the bar but I knew after one session in the weight room that it was the most fun I'd had in P.E. in, well, ever. Sadly, that was only one quarter and then it was back to horrible things like playing volleyball or flag football or, heaven forbid, basketball. Ugh.

However, that quarter taught me my way around a weight room so that those barbells and dumbbells weren't so intimidating. I learned how to use a squat rack and how much an Olympic barbell weighs (it's basically 45 pounds, by the way).

Over the years since high school I dabbled in various strength training programs. In college I stuck to dumbbells and cardio, when I remembered to use the gym. I had a personal trainer for a few months after I got married but she mostly had me use weight machines. Weight machines, cardio and the occasional dumbbell exercise became my routine.

A few years ago I tried doing the workouts in the New Rules of Lifting for Women. But, let's be honest, going to the gym after work means fighting for space and trying to track down the weights that you need. We built a serviceable gym in our basement but it lacked a squat rack and a few other key pieces of equipment. Then I started marathon training, dealt with a weird hip injury, and strength training got put on the back burner.

But last fall I met a woman who told me about <a title="Thinner, Leaner, Stronger: 10 things I’ve learned by going by the book" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/2014/12/thinner-leaner-stronger-10-things-ive-learned-by-going-by-the-book/">Thinner, Leaner, Stronger</a> and I decided to check it out. What did I learn? Lift heavy and lift

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1332" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-24 at 9.28.35 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-24-at-9.28.35-PM-300x297.png" width="300" height="297" />often. I joined the gym in my office building and started going every day at lunch. I started tracking my progress. I ended up with a personal trainer who finally showed me how to squat and deadlift and bench press and doesn't have me use weight machines or tiny dumbbells.

So on Tuesday when I met with my trainer he looked at me and said, "So, you wanna go for a deadlift personal record today?" Why yes, yes I do.

We did some warm-up sets and then he said, "Okay, I'm putting 195 pounds on this bar and you're going to lift it 2 times."

I had two options: I could be really good at self-doubt or I could be really good at weight lifting. I chose the latter. And I lifted that bar twice. I totally could have gone a third time, too, but we didn't want to push it.

"You must feel pretty badass," he said. "You can lift more than most guys."

Heck, I can lift more than most PEOPLE!

Fighting for space with the "meatheads" doesn't intimidate me any more. I can lift just as much, if not more. Because you know what? I think this is my thing I could be really, really good at it. Because I kind of am already.

Plus, it's pretty freaking awesome to be a petite woman who can deadlift almost twice what she weighs and can squat her own bodyweight. And who doesn't want to be awesome?

As a nice counterbalance, how about a post on something I am good at?

You know, it's actually a little bit difficult to write about something you're really good at without trying to be humble. I can come up with all sorts of things that I'm average at (running marathons, biking, cooking dinner, doing household chores) but picking one thing I'm really good at? It's tough. But here goes nothing.

I'm actually really good at weightlifting.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-24-at-9.12.57-PM.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1331" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-24 at 9.12.57 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-24-at-9.12.57-PM-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>I remember back in high school we had a segment in P.E. on weight lifting. At the time I could barely bench press the bar but I knew after one session in the weight room that it was the most fun I'd had in P.E. in, well, ever. Sadly, that was only one quarter and then it was back to horrible things like playing volleyball or flag football or, heaven forbid, basketball. Ugh.

However, that quarter taught me my way around a weight room so that those barbells and dumbbells weren't so intimidating. I learned how to use a squat rack and how much an Olympic barbell weighs (it's basically 45 pounds, by the way).

Over the years since high school I dabbled in various strength training programs. In college I stuck to dumbbells and cardio, when I remembered to use the gym. I had a personal trainer for a few months after I got married but she mostly had me use weight machines. Weight machines, cardio and the occasional dumbbell exercise became my routine.

A few years ago I tried doing the workouts in the New Rules of Lifting for Women. But, let's be honest, going to the gym after work means fighting for space and trying to track down the weights that you need. We built a serviceable gym in our basement but it lacked a squat rack and a few other key pieces of equipment. Then I started marathon training, dealt with a weird hip injury, and strength training got put on the back burner.

But last fall I met a woman who told me about <a title="Thinner, Leaner, Stronger: 10 things I’ve learned by going by the book" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/2014/12/thinner-leaner-stronger-10-things-ive-learned-by-going-by-the-book/">Thinner, Leaner, Stronger</a> and I decided to check it out. What did I learn? Lift heavy and lift

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1332" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-24 at 9.28.35 PM" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-24-at-9.28.35-PM-300x297.png" width="300" height="297" />often. I joined the gym in my office building and started going every day at lunch. I started tracking my progress. I ended up with a personal trainer who finally showed me how to squat and deadlift and bench press and doesn't have me use weight machines or tiny dumbbells.

So on Tuesday when I met with my trainer he looked at me and said, "So, you wanna go for a deadlift personal record today?" Why yes, yes I do.

We did some warm-up sets and then he said, "Okay, I'm putting 195 pounds on this bar and you're going to lift it 2 times."

I had two options: I could be really good at self-doubt or I could be really good at weight lifting. I chose the latter. And I lifted that bar twice. I totally could have gone a third time, too, but we didn't want to push it.

"You must feel pretty badass," he said. "You can lift more than most guys."

Heck, I can lift more than most PEOPLE!

Fighting for space with the "meatheads" doesn't intimidate me any more. I can lift just as much, if not more. Because you know what? I think this is my thing I could be really, really good at it. Because I kind of am already.

Plus, it's pretty freaking awesome to be a petite woman who can deadlift almost twice what she weighs and can squat her own bodyweight. And who doesn't want to be awesome?

Nine sets of 75 yards each? Yep, I can do that now.

But I still can't swim half a mile in open water without flipping onto my back, doing breaststroke, dog paddling, or basically wishing I was anywhere but there.

I know. I've tried it three times.

But, Erin, you're saying, three times is hardly enough!

At least, I hope that's what you're saying. Because last night, in the middle of a set of 75 yards where we swam the first half fast and the second half slow, I realized something: I need to hit the wall.

When I'm swimming in the pool I feel strong. Even when I think I can't make it one more stroke I look at the bottom and see that I'm so close to the wall and I bust out just a few more feet before pushing off to start back the other way or grabbing for the edge at the end of the set.

I LIVE for that wall. I live for that goal line. Swimming isn't like running or biking. In addition to not being able to breathe whenever you want, when you're out in the open water you have very little in the way of landmarks that tell you how far you've gone and how far you have left to go. Buoys are like mirages; they never seem to get closer. Buildings alongside  <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/ohio-street-beach/" target="_blank">Ohio Street Beach</a> never seem to recede into the distance.

When I did my <a title="My first triathlon: Esprit de She Naperville" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/2015/06/my-first-triathlon-esprit-de-she-naperville/" target="_blank">triathlon</a> last weekend it was sort of like swimming in a huge pool...except it was one where the lanes were longer than I was used to and there were no black lines on the bottom to tell me when I was reaching the end of each lane. Sure, I could lift my head up and see a buoy but I had no concept of how much further I really had. I was so happy when I figured out that the lifeguards were standing at the halfway point...and that I could touch the bottom at the halfway point of each lane! I just had to make it to the halfway mark and I could put my feet down for a second and regroup. That was my wall.

Do I just need to practice without my wall more often? Should I find a 50 meter pool so I can get used to going longer between breaks? Do I need to get a watch that will beep every 25 yards so that I have an idea of where I would be in the pool?

For all the reading and research I did before I decided to do triathlons, I didn't read anything about how to transition from pool swimming to open water swimming. I'm doing an Open Water Swim Clinic next week but I'd also love any advice anyone has to give!

Amazingly, the flailing of limbs and bodies at the start of the swim doesn't freak me out. And the deep end of the pool doesn't freak me out. But everything else about being out in the lake? It's starting to freak me out!

Jason and I left the apartment to pick up another of my Live Grit team members. With our bikes on the back of the car and our bags full of wetsuits, swim caps, bike shoes, running shoes, and other assorted paraphernalia we headed to Naperville for the Esprit de She sprint triathlon - my very first tri.

I've been swimming once a week in a pool and I'd been in Lake Michigan twice but I still wasn't sure about the swim. I'd read blogs and attended a talk on how to set-up transition and I'd heard the course talk. But what I wasn't sure how to do was set-up my transition area in the rain. And there was rain. Lots of it.

My teammate Kristan and I racked our bikes next to one another and stared at the river of rain that was creating a small lake under our bikes. Lake Live Grit, I named it. She laid down her towel and it was immediately soaked. The rain just kept coming. Thankfully there was no lightning so we just kept looking at each other and laughing. Who knew we'd be soaked before we even got to the swim?<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1310" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-6" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-6.jpg" width="350" height="232" /></a>

I'd been told that most people who wear a wetsuit for the swim don't put it on until they were on the beach. However, with the rain and the slightly chilly temperatures I donned my wetsuit and swim cap almost two hours before I needed to. I was still shaking, though, but I wasn't sure if that was due to being wet and cold or just from nerves.

<img class=" wp-image-1311 alignright" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-2" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-2.jpg" width="350" height="350" />

Into the water we waded. The horn sounded and off we went. I'd started near the front of my wave and immediately it was a flurry of arms and legs and bodies bumping into me on every side. Amazingly, I didn't panic or freak out. I just put my feet down since I could still stand and I waited for the masses to subside a bit before I took off.The whole ridiculous rain situation made it a bit difficult to lay out everything I needed so I just left it in plastic trash bags and hoped I wouldn't forget anything for each leg. However, the ridiculous rain situation also made for a great distraction! Looking around at all the other woman, laughing with my teammates when the rain seemed to swell in time with the national anthem, and then realizing that, yes, I was going to start swimming while it was still raining.

Well, took off might be overstating it. I tried to put into practice everything I'd learned in swim class since January. Don't kick too hard. Pull with both arms. Breathe out underwater.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1312" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-3" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-3.jpg" width="350" height="350" /></a>I admit, this race is perfect for beginners because you can touch the bottom at the halfway point of each lap since the swim is basically in a huge pool. This was a godsend for me because, as it turns out, my swim endurance still isn't as good as I want it to be. Yet, I never once panicked. I did have to do backstroke for a bit and I definitely interspersed some breaststroke and doggy paddling. But I had enough energy and spirit to encourage one of my teammates (who later told me that hearing my voice say she could do really helped) and I came out of the water in one piece thrilled that I managed to complete 750 meters!<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1313 alignright" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-4" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-4-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>

I was also thrilled that the rain had stopped as I jogged to my bike and stripped off my wetsuit. I grabbed my only-slightly-damp socks and bike shoes out of a plastic trash bag, exchanged my swim cap and goggles for a bike helmet and sunglasses (not that there was any sun, but it would keep the wind and water out of my eyes) and ran for the exit with my bike.

Because of the water logged roads I was a bit more cautious on my bike than I would have been, especially around the turns. Still, I felt good on the bike and pedaled hard. I took a Gu at the beginning of the bike and another one a few miles from the end when I could feel my quads starting to ache. I passed lots of people on the bike but only four people passed me (and all of them had nicer road/tri bikes than I did). I waved to one of our team's mechanics who was riding the course and doing bike repairs. And I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1314" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-7" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Off the bike I was warned that the parking lot in transition was slippery so I opted to walk my bike back to the rack and swap my bike shoes for my running shoes. My socks were soaked so I was happy I'd chosen to wear my Nike Flyknits sans socks for the run.

My legs felt surprisingly good. Even better than when I do duathlons! I opted not to wear my Garmin so I honestly had no idea how fast I was running. I just ran by feel, grabbed water at the water stations, and encouraged other runners. And realized I'd forgotten to<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1315 alignright" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-5" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-5-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> put on my race belt with my race number! Oops. I felt like I'd forgotten something when I left on the bike but I hadn't. Turns out I was just foreshadowing my run. Thankfully it didn't end up mattering.

I ran through that finish line with my fist in the air and a huge smile on my face. I honestly never thought I'd do a triathlon and I fully admit that part way through <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1316" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-8" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-8-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>the swim I thought I'd just stick to duathlons. Right now I wouldn't say I'm hooked but I will say that I'm looking forward to spending the rest of the summer with my Live Grit team getting better and better at this sport of triathlon.

P.S. For those of you interested in stats, I finished in 1:31:04. Unsurprisingly, my run was my best leg and I almost set a 5K PR! Only missed it by 4 seconds!

Jason and I left the apartment to pick up another of my Live Grit team members. With our bikes on the back of the car and our bags full of wetsuits, swim caps, bike shoes, running shoes, and other assorted paraphernalia we headed to Naperville for the Esprit de She sprint triathlon - my very first tri.

I've been swimming once a week in a pool and I'd been in Lake Michigan twice but I still wasn't sure about the swim. I'd read blogs and attended a talk on how to set-up transition and I'd heard the course talk. But what I wasn't sure how to do was set-up my transition area in the rain. And there was rain. Lots of it.

My teammate Kristan and I racked our bikes next to one another and stared at the river of rain that was creating a small lake under our bikes. Lake Live Grit, I named it. She laid down her towel and it was immediately soaked. The rain just kept coming. Thankfully there was no lightning so we just kept looking at each other and laughing. Who knew we'd be soaked before we even got to the swim?<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-6.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1310" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-6" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-6.jpg" width="350" height="232" /></a>

I'd been told that most people who wear a wetsuit for the swim don't put it on until they were on the beach. However, with the rain and the slightly chilly temperatures I donned my wetsuit and swim cap almost two hours before I needed to. I was still shaking, though, but I wasn't sure if that was due to being wet and cold or just from nerves.

<img class=" wp-image-1311 alignright" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-2" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-2.jpg" width="350" height="350" />

Into the water we waded. The horn sounded and off we went. I'd started near the front of my wave and immediately it was a flurry of arms and legs and bodies bumping into me on every side. Amazingly, I didn't panic or freak out. I just put my feet down since I could still stand and I waited for the masses to subside a bit before I took off.The whole ridiculous rain situation made it a bit difficult to lay out everything I needed so I just left it in plastic trash bags and hoped I wouldn't forget anything for each leg. However, the ridiculous rain situation also made for a great distraction! Looking around at all the other woman, laughing with my teammates when the rain seemed to swell in time with the national anthem, and then realizing that, yes, I was going to start swimming while it was still raining.

Well, took off might be overstating it. I tried to put into practice everything I'd learned in swim class since January. Don't kick too hard. Pull with both arms. Breathe out underwater.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1312" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-3" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-3.jpg" width="350" height="350" /></a>I admit, this race is perfect for beginners because you can touch the bottom at the halfway point of each lap since the swim is basically in a huge pool. This was a godsend for me because, as it turns out, my swim endurance still isn't as good as I want it to be. Yet, I never once panicked. I did have to do backstroke for a bit and I definitely interspersed some breaststroke and doggy paddling. But I had enough energy and spirit to encourage one of my teammates (who later told me that hearing my voice say she could do really helped) and I came out of the water in one piece thrilled that I managed to complete 750 meters!<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1313 alignright" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-4" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-4-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>

I was also thrilled that the rain had stopped as I jogged to my bike and stripped off my wetsuit. I grabbed my only-slightly-damp socks and bike shoes out of a plastic trash bag, exchanged my swim cap and goggles for a bike helmet and sunglasses (not that there was any sun, but it would keep the wind and water out of my eyes) and ran for the exit with my bike.

Because of the water logged roads I was a bit more cautious on my bike than I would have been, especially around the turns. Still, I felt good on the bike and pedaled hard. I took a Gu at the beginning of the bike and another one a few miles from the end when I could feel my quads starting to ache. I passed lots of people on the bike but only four people passed me (and all of them had nicer road/tri bikes than I did). I waved to one of our team's mechanics who was riding the course and doing bike repairs. And I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1314" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-7" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Off the bike I was warned that the parking lot in transition was slippery so I opted to walk my bike back to the rack and swap my bike shoes for my running shoes. My socks were soaked so I was happy I'd chosen to wear my Nike Flyknits sans socks for the run.

My legs felt surprisingly good. Even better than when I do duathlons! I opted not to wear my Garmin so I honestly had no idea how fast I was running. I just ran by feel, grabbed water at the water stations, and encouraged other runners. And realized I'd forgotten to<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1315 alignright" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-5" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-5-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> put on my race belt with my race number! Oops. I felt like I'd forgotten something when I left on the bike but I hadn't. Turns out I was just foreshadowing my run. Thankfully it didn't end up mattering.

I ran through that finish line with my fist in the air and a huge smile on my face. I honestly never thought I'd do a triathlon and I fully admit that part way through <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1316" alt="live-grit-esprit-de-she-8" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/06/live-grit-esprit-de-she-8-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>the swim I thought I'd just stick to duathlons. Right now I wouldn't say I'm hooked but I will say that I'm looking forward to spending the rest of the summer with my Live Grit team getting better and better at this sport of triathlon.

P.S. For those of you interested in stats, I finished in 1:31:04. Unsurprisingly, my run was my best leg and I almost set a 5K PR! Only missed it by 4 seconds!

My life is pretty good right now. Today I was stressed out that I didn't have time to fit in a workout. But just by writing this post I'm remembering that life is about so much more than that. It's about being silly with your husband, spending time with your furry family members, and experiencing new things, whatever they may be.

And, you know, triathlon training. Because I suppose I should really do some kind of "brick" workout before my first triathlon on June 14th. Actually, I'm not going to worry about that. I'm going to take it one day at a time. Starting with tomorrow.

They're the ones who are teaching me to swim. They're the ones who answer all the silly questions I have about biking. They're the ones who didn't make me feel ridiculous for not knowing anything about wetsuits. Their employees feel more like friends than people trying to sell you stuff and they've created an awesome community of athletes. Their tag line is that they're Chicago's most laid back triathlon store and I love them for that. I also love that they are a 5 minute walk from my apartment.

Anyway, just like the <a title="How TO train for a half marathon, apparently" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/2015/04/how-to-train-for-a-half-marathon-apparently/" target="_blank">South Shore Half Marathon</a>, I did no specific run training for the 10 miler.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/IMG_6369-XL.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1289 alignright" alt="IMG_6369-XL" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/IMG_6369-XL-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a>

<span style="color: #0000ee;"> </span>

And, spoiler alert, I managed to run my fastest 10 miles ever. I'm still in awe at myself when I look at my average pace per mile. Sub-8:30, people.  I've NEVER run that many miles that fast.

So, I joked with some people that I'm going to patent my non-training training plan.

How does it work?

1. Run a 10K in November and then basically run no more than 3-5 miles once a week or so until six weeks before you're scheduled to do a half marathon in April. Run a few 8 milers and two 10 milers and MAYBE run one other short run during the week.

2. Swim once a week with a <a href="http://www.bishop-racing.com/" target="_blank">coach</a> that makes you do crazy things like intervals, drills and <a href="http://www.alexandriamasters.com/articles/hypoxic.htm" target="_blank">hypoxic training</a>.

3. Lift weights 3-4 times a week following the plan in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinner-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate/dp/1938895290/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429626044&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thinner+leaner+stronger" target="_blank">Thinner, Leaner, Stronger</a>. Workout with a personal trainer once a week.

4. Do an occasional HIIT workout on the bike trainer, treadmill or in a class like SHRED 415.

Also, I highly recommend not looking at your Garmin or other GPS watch during your race. As someone in my running club once said, "run stupid."

Clearly this is working for me. And I love it. I love the variety. I love not being tied to a running training plan after years of being a slave to what it said on the calendar. I love that I can now deadlift more than my bodyweight and crush a 10 mile run. And, hey, actually swim!

What should I call my new training plan?</strong>

They're the ones who are teaching me to swim. They're the ones who answer all the silly questions I have about biking. They're the ones who didn't make me feel ridiculous for not knowing anything about wetsuits. Their employees feel more like friends than people trying to sell you stuff and they've created an awesome community of athletes. Their tag line is that they're Chicago's most laid back triathlon store and I love them for that. I also love that they are a 5 minute walk from my apartment.

Anyway, just like the <a title="How TO train for a half marathon, apparently" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/2015/04/how-to-train-for-a-half-marathon-apparently/" target="_blank">South Shore Half Marathon</a>, I did no specific run training for the 10 miler.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/IMG_6369-XL.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1289 alignright" alt="IMG_6369-XL" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/IMG_6369-XL-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a>

<span style="color: #0000ee;"> </span>

And, spoiler alert, I managed to run my fastest 10 miles ever. I'm still in awe at myself when I look at my average pace per mile. Sub-8:30, people.  I've NEVER run that many miles that fast.

So, I joked with some people that I'm going to patent my non-training training plan.

How does it work?

1. Run a 10K in November and then basically run no more than 3-5 miles once a week or so until six weeks before you're scheduled to do a half marathon in April. Run a few 8 milers and two 10 milers and MAYBE run one other short run during the week.

2. Swim once a week with a <a href="http://www.bishop-racing.com/" target="_blank">coach</a> that makes you do crazy things like intervals, drills and <a href="http://www.alexandriamasters.com/articles/hypoxic.htm" target="_blank">hypoxic training</a>.

3. Lift weights 3-4 times a week following the plan in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinner-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate/dp/1938895290/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429626044&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thinner+leaner+stronger" target="_blank">Thinner, Leaner, Stronger</a>. Workout with a personal trainer once a week.

4. Do an occasional HIIT workout on the bike trainer, treadmill or in a class like SHRED 415.

Also, I highly recommend not looking at your Garmin or other GPS watch during your race. As someone in my running club once said, "run stupid."

Clearly this is working for me. And I love it. I love the variety. I love not being tied to a running training plan after years of being a slave to what it said on the calendar. I love that I can now deadlift more than my bodyweight and crush a 10 mile run. And, hey, actually swim!

What should I call my new training plan?</strong>

Well, I ran the South Shore Half Marathon and it's official. You can ignore my advice. I clearly DO know how to train for a half marathon.

Why do I say that? Because at the South Shore Half I ran my second fastest half marathon ever.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/south-shore-half-2015_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1278" alt="south-shore-half-2015_1" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/south-shore-half-2015_1-297x300.jpg" width="297" height="300" /></a>

Yeah. I was surprised, too.

I decided at the beginning to not pay attention to my Garmin and just run by feel. I'd been running a 9:30 pace during the few long training runs I did so I was pleased to see my first two miles were just a tad faster. Yes, I know, I just said I wasn't going to look at my Garmin. I promise you, after those first two miles I didn't.

The South Shore Half is on a bike path that starts in a park in the Bay View area of Milwaukee. You have a beautiful view of the skyline in the distance across the water but you're never in downtown Milwaukee. Which is perfect because you don't have to fight traffic or hunt for parking. It's all residential and free!

There are indoor bathrooms and a nice warm place to wait for the race start. Oh, and did I mention, it's only $15 if you register in advance and only $25 on race day?? I got a free entry from the race director but I'll totally pay the money next year.

[caption id="attachment_1279" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/south-shore-half-2015-edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1279 " alt="south-shore-half-2015-edit" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/south-shore-half-2015-edit-300x235.jpg" width="300" height="235" /></a> Photo from https://runnerjeffpics.shutterfly.com/pictures/5180[/caption]

I believe the race had around 950 participants so it was much larger than I was expecting. The first few miles were a bit crowded and there was a section after the turn around of the out-and-back course that was pretty narrow with people going both ways but that might be because I seeded myself too far back in the pack.

Around mile 8 or so I tucked in behind a couple who had passed me in the first mile. She was something like 7 months pregnant (at least!) and they were chatting about how she was doing. "I'm happy we're still holding a sub-9:00 pace!" she exclaimed.

Excuse me? What? Is that right? I snuck a glance at my Garmin. Yep. Sub-9:00 minute. Well, okay then. I'll just hang out right here and see how long this lasts.

I ended up passing them.

The course is full of shade for the most part and reminds me of a mix of the the lakefront path in Chicago and the Salt Creek bike path in Brookfield. It's mostly park with a good section along the lake. The only downside? Wind! At mile 11 or so you go up a hill and on race day the wind was blowing down the hill. Uphill into the wind? Yay.

When I hit mile 10 I looked at my Garmin to see if there was a chance I could break 2 hours; it read 1 hour and 30 minutes meaning I had to run a sub-30 minute 5K. No problem. I picked up the pace and my last three miles ended up being my fastest.

The weather was perfect. Chilly and overcast at the start but warmer and sunny at the end. I wore a t-shirt, capris, arm warmers and gloves. I ended up stripping off the arm warmers and gloves but I was really glad I had them at the start line!

The South Shore Half Marathon is an interesting mix of no-frills and great perks. There are only two water/Gatorade stations but you hit each one twice since the course is a pure out-and-back set up. No bands or GU or really even that many spectators along the way. Fine by me. The finish line has beer (good beer!) until they run out and communal bags of pretzels, chips, and cookies. It's kind of like if your bachelor friend with good taste in beer threw a party. Also fine by me. The race is chip timed and the timing company had iPad stations set up so you could check your official time ASAP. They also emailed it to you as soon as you crossed the finish line. Now that's service! No official pictures, medal or t-shirt but if you've run enough races you aren't necessarily interested in those things. And for $15 (or $25) you still get a really well done race.

<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/palomino.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1276" alt="palomino" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/04/palomino-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>And I promise I'm not just saying all of that because I finished in a time I never expected. I would feel that way regardless. If you're tired of over-priced and over-hyped Chicago races then the South Shore Half is your antidote. Plus, now I know the best place to refuel after the race. It's called Palomino and it's within walking distance. Be sure and get a Danger Zone and at least one biscuit.

Then, recently I read a <a href="http://www.thereallife-rd.com/2015/03/things-you-should-know.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> recently from a writer who wrote:
<blockquote>You will become who you surround yourself with. If you hang around people who are preoccupied with food + exercise, you will become preoccupied with food + exercise. That includes social media accounts and people online too.</blockquote>
Rather unintentionally I've found that the word "prep" has seeped into my internal vocabulary. What in the world does "prep" mean? Well, it doesn't mean preppy. In in the context I'm using it it means prepping for a bikini competition. You know, one where you work your tail off (almost literally) to get into great shape and then stand in front of a crowd getting judged.

No, not a bodybuilding competition, which even I think is scary. A bikini competition. (<a href="http://www.ngaidaho.com/whats-the-difference-womens-bodybuilding-figure-and-bikini/" target="_blank">Here are the differences</a>)

At least two people I follow on Instagram are talking about this. I've seen #prep used by several others.

And, just like that quotation above, I find myself wondering....could I do a bikini competition?

And then I remember that on Wednesday night last week Jason and I had to run a last minute errand so we went to our standby restaurant for dinner. On Thursday I  joined a friend for drinks and dinner. Friday was happy hour with my <a href="http://livegrit.com/" target="_blank">Live Grit</a> team. Saturday was lunch at a restaurant I've been wanting to try and then my favorite pizza place for dinner with my mom.

Apparently when you're prepping for competition you have very little leeway in what you can eat. I know. It's basically a diet similar to what how I've been trying to eat 80% of the time. And when I eat that way 90% of the time? Abs.

Yes, I started this whole process just to see what I could do. And if I stuck to the diet 100% I bet I could get into a competition worthy shape. And I fully admit there's a part of my brain that is intrigued by the idea.

But the other part of me wants to enjoy trying new restaurants. Getting drinks with friends. Eating pizza. Those should not be bad things and I feel like if I was to go full-on abs-are-the-only-goal that my life would be really, really dull.

So, for me, I love the way I feel right now. I love that I can now do a chin-up (<a href="https://instagram.com/p/0iTQdnl_qu/" target="_blank">proof</a>!) I don't want to feel guilty if I eat pretzels one day. I don't want to have to say "no" to going out with a friend .

Again, going back to that blog post,
<blockquote>Whether you're paleo or vegan or whatever, if your way of eating hinders your social life you should probably reevaluate the "healthiness" of that healthy lifestyle. Food isn't black and white or legalistic. One meal is not going to derail your healthy efforts or cause chronic disease, but the stress or avoiding particular foods might.

I 100% agree. I worked just as hard for my social life as I work for my strength gains.

Then, recently I read a <a href="http://www.thereallife-rd.com/2015/03/things-you-should-know.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> recently from a writer who wrote:
<blockquote>You will become who you surround yourself with. If you hang around people who are preoccupied with food + exercise, you will become preoccupied with food + exercise. That includes social media accounts and people online too.</blockquote>
Rather unintentionally I've found that the word "prep" has seeped into my internal vocabulary. What in the world does "prep" mean? Well, it doesn't mean preppy. In in the context I'm using it it means prepping for a bikini competition. You know, one where you work your tail off (almost literally) to get into great shape and then stand in front of a crowd getting judged.

No, not a bodybuilding competition, which even I think is scary. A bikini competition. (<a href="http://www.ngaidaho.com/whats-the-difference-womens-bodybuilding-figure-and-bikini/" target="_blank">Here are the differences</a>)

At least two people I follow on Instagram are talking about this. I've seen #prep used by several others.

And, just like that quotation above, I find myself wondering....could I do a bikini competition?

And then I remember that on Wednesday night last week Jason and I had to run a last minute errand so we went to our standby restaurant for dinner. On Thursday I  joined a friend for drinks and dinner. Friday was happy hour with my <a href="http://livegrit.com/" target="_blank">Live Grit</a> team. Saturday was lunch at a restaurant I've been wanting to try and then my favorite pizza place for dinner with my mom.

Apparently when you're prepping for competition you have very little leeway in what you can eat. I know. It's basically a diet similar to what how I've been trying to eat 80% of the time. And when I eat that way 90% of the time? Abs.

Yes, I started this whole process just to see what I could do. And if I stuck to the diet 100% I bet I could get into a competition worthy shape. And I fully admit there's a part of my brain that is intrigued by the idea.

But the other part of me wants to enjoy trying new restaurants. Getting drinks with friends. Eating pizza. Those should not be bad things and I feel like if I was to go full-on abs-are-the-only-goal that my life would be really, really dull.

So, for me, I love the way I feel right now. I love that I can now do a chin-up (<a href="https://instagram.com/p/0iTQdnl_qu/" target="_blank">proof</a>!) I don't want to feel guilty if I eat pretzels one day. I don't want to have to say "no" to going out with a friend .

Again, going back to that blog post,
<blockquote>Whether you're paleo or vegan or whatever, if your way of eating hinders your social life you should probably reevaluate the "healthiness" of that healthy lifestyle. Food isn't black and white or legalistic. One meal is not going to derail your healthy efforts or cause chronic disease, but the stress or avoiding particular foods might. Most importantly, food is meant to be shared with others and celebrated.</blockquote>

Yep.

Is this going to hurt?

Well, that I don't know.

I  mean, I haven't just been sitting around on my butt doing nothing. I've been doing a ton of strength training (probably literally if I added up how much weight I've slung around) as well as swimming once a week, the occasional short (3-6 mile) run and a VERY occasional bike trainer spin class. Oh, and some indoor rock climbing.

All in all, I'd say I'm in pretty good shape. I'm definitely stronger than I've been in the past. I'm actually to the point where I can swim 50 yards at a time with minimal rest. Heck, I was even on the winning relay team when we did some friendly competition in our swim class.

Two weeks or so ago I ran 8 miles with our pup, Chewie. Yes, he's a pretty good running buddy. Last weekend we ran 6 miles together. I don't
feel particularly winded, tired or sore after those runs so I have high hopes that I'm not doing something totally stupid by running two double digit races.

My plan this weekend is to run 10 miles. Originally I thought about taking Chewie with me but then, as it turns out, I decided to sign up for the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pi-day-pi-k-fun-runwalk-2015-registration-15310343650" target="_blank">Pi Day 5K Fun Run</a> and get in 7 miles beforehand, run the 3.14 mile fun run, and then refuel with pie. So, sorry Chewie, no 10 mile run for you.

I fully admit that this is a really stupid way to train for a race. In

Just, you know, long runs.

Right now I feel like I'm in a good place with my fitness pursuits.

Now, ask me again in a month after I run these races and start to think about triathlon training.

If you had told me 10 years ago that I would live in an apartment in Chicago, take public transit to work, and take my dog to a dog park with a view of the Sears Tower I would not have believed you. In fact, I once proclaimed that if I had to live in Chicago I would vomit.

But here I am and there’s no vomit!

Growing up in Champaign, Illinois you had to work hard to find an adventure. Our idea of being daring was hanging out in public parks after dark. In college at Miami University I was more inclined to stay in and watch X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes until my roommates and I could quote them verbatim. The most interesting story I had to tell about myself was that I was once in a car accident where my car was hit by a hearse. There wasn't even a body in the hearse!

I wasn't one of those people who graduated and couldn't wait to move to the big city. In fact, I’m still not sure what possessed me to apply for and accept the job that brought me to Chicago.

However, I knew that it was a chance for me to break out of my comfort zone. To try and find my inner adventurer.

Looking back over the past 6  years since I moved to Chicago  I've realized that there are 4 main steps to becoming more adventurous.

Step 1: <strong>Join something.</strong> For me that was a running group. I’d started running in 2007 and in 2009 I decided to train for my first half marathon. I went to my first Monday night run with the Oak Park Runners Club with knots in my stomach. I didn't know anyone. What if they were all faster than me? What if no one talked to me? Those fears were unfounded, though, and I quickly found myself with a new group of friends. In fact, I had more friends that I had back in Champaign and we were doing things such as going out to dinner together and even traveling to Las Vegas to run a marathon together!

<center><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1242" alt="oprc" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/01/oprc-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></center>

Step 2: <strong>Say yes.</strong> When my running group friends asked me to go to Las Vegas and run the marathon to celebrate their wedding anniversary I could have said no. But I didn’t. I said yes. In fact, saying yes became my mantra. I joined the executive board of both the running club and Chicago chapter of the Association of Records Managers and Administrators. Yes, such a thing exists. I started a running blog and made dates to run with other bloggers who I’d never met before. My comfort zone began to grow as I invited more people to be part of my life.

<center><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/01/lv_marathon_group.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1245" alt="lv_marathon_group" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2015/01/lv_marathon_group-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></center>

Step 3: I’m sure you've heard the saying “<strong>do one thing every day that scares you</strong>.” I wouldn't say that I did one thing every day, but part of my saying yes mantra was trying scary things when the opportunity arose. Which means when Living Social sent me a deal for flying trapeze class or a trip to a shooting range in Michigan I said yes to both even though I was simultaneously terrified and intrigued. I ended up taking flying trapeze classes for a year and my husband and I now go to the shooting range every few months. Just like living in Chicago, if you’d asked me about either of those 10 years ago I would have laughed.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2013/09/trapeze-e1380161904664.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-710 aligncenter" alt="Trapeze in Chicago" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/files/2013/09/trapeze-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></a></p>
Step 4: <strong>Put yourself out there</strong>. Joining that running group was my first step into the world of attending group events where I wouldn't know anyone else. When I started my <a href="http://looplooks.net/" target="_blank">other blog </a>in 2012 it came with more visibility and more opportunities to meet people in Chicago because I joined other blogger networks. My mother doesn't understand the appeal of writing about yourself on the internet but I’ll tell you this: some of my best friends I've met through my blogs. I have the opportunity to attend events in places I never would have known about. The word “networking” no longer strikes fear into my heart.

My birthday is Monday and as I reflect on the past 35 years I know that I’m definitely more adventurous than I was 10 years ago. Joining groups, saying yes to events, going even though I was scared and putting myself out there to meet others all lead me to realize that fear does not have to hold you back. Which is why for 2015 I've signed up for my first triathlon and start coached swim lessons on Monday. Let's start my 35th year by continuing to be adventurous!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Erin Vandenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5659:"At my current job we recently started a Toastmasters club and I'm scheduled to give my first prepared speech next week.

Which means when Living Social sent me a deal for flying trapeze class or a trip to a shooting range in Michigan I said yes to both even though I was simultaneously terrified and intrigued. I ended up taking flying trapeze classes for a year and my husband and I now go to the shooting range every few months. Just like living in Chicago, if you’d asked me about either of those 10 years ago I would have laughed.

Step 4: <strong>Put yourself out there</strong>. Joining that running group was my first step into the world of attending group events where I wouldn't know anyone else. When I started my <a href="http://looplooks.net/" target="_blank">other blog </a>in 2012 it came with more visibility and more opportunities to meet people in Chicago because I joined other blogger networks. My mother doesn't understand the appeal of writing about yourself on the internet but I’ll tell you this: some of my best friends I've met through my blogs. I have the opportunity to attend events in places I never would have known about. The word “networking” no longer strikes fear into my heart.

My birthday is Monday and as I reflect on the past 35 years I know that I’m definitely more adventurous than I was 10 years ago. Joining groups, saying yes to events, going even though I was scared and putting myself out there to meet others all lead me to realize that fear does not have to hold you back. Which is why for 2015 I've signed up for my first triathlon and start coached swim lessons on Monday. Let's start my 35th year by continuing to be adventurous!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:12:{s:6:"server";s:20:"nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)";s:12:"content-type";s:34:"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8";s:12:"x-powered-by";s:20:"PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.4";s:10:"x-pingback";s:45:"http://www.chicagonow.com/eri-thon/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"cache-control";s:30:"max-age = 600, must-revalidate";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 21:16:09 GMT";s:9:"x-varnish";s:9:"483662677";s:3:"via";s:11:"1.1 varnish";s:10:"connection";s:10:"keep-alive";s:3:"age";s:1:"0";s:7:"x-cache";s:4:"Miss";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130725002037";}
