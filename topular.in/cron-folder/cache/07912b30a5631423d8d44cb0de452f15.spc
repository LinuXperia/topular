<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting your blog content is great for web traffic and SEO, but if no one is coming to your site, how useful is that content? Could a blog post be doing more if it was more readily available to a larger audience than the one that goes to your website and sticks around long enough to find and read your blog? Social media does a lot of the heavy lifting, but reaching those that want to read and are looking for blog content isn’t always as easy as tweeting your blog and posting it on your Facebook page.</span></p>
<p>Blog sharing sites like Medium and StumbleUpon are on the rise and that’s awesome for getting more readers exposed to content, but is it hurting you in the end? When people see your blog on a site like Medium, are they going to come to your site for more?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know what’s good for you, you or someone else is writing blogs for your website or company. Generating content for your site is one of the best ways to increase traffic and shows your audience that not only do you know what you’re talking about, you’re a resource for news, information and other content that audiences are interested in reading about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is the line between generating traffic and oversharing? Could posting your blog on multiple sites be hurting SEO and driving traffic away from your website to third party sites? I did some digging and found some pretty interesting results. Nothing I found is definitive to either side of this thinking, but it is important to note these results when looking at the possibilities for your own blog strategy.</span></p>
<h2>Post It:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you want to find out about something, you more than likely are going to Google it. When I want to read about SEO or email newsletters, I rarely go straight to one professional website to read up, I will go to sites with a wealth of information that I can look through and decide what is relevant to me. Posting your blog with tags on more popular sites gets you in front of people that probably didn’t know you or would ever search for you from Google. This exchange of information all in one place puts you in front of readers looking to read about your topic specifically</span></p>
<h2>Alter It:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting everywhere and anywhere could actually be really damaging to your blog and your SEO. When reposting, I try to be careful about where that content is going to end up. Consistently posting to third party sites will pull search results to their website instead of yours. One way to avoid this is by altering your content. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vary the title: Altering the content is your best bet if you are republishing content and concerned for your overall SEO advantage. Think outside of what you know about your topic and industry. Avoid overly technical blog titles and think like the person with less knowledge looking to find answers to the question or issue you’re solving with your content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate your content: If you are blogging consistently you are more than likely generating a lot of content on a few topics. Pull these blogs together and alter the post to frankenstein a few blogs into one information filled blog post. You’ve already done the hard work by writing these blogs in the first place. Take a look at your old content and see how some posts could fit together for a longer, more in-depth blog post that you can post and link back to the original blogs on your page.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different sites to post your content, not all of them appropriate for you and your industry. Be aware of where you put content and pay attention to the channels that bring people back for more, that&#8217;s the goal in reposting blog content so you should keep an eye on what&#8217;s working. In the end, having blog content on your site and your site alone is good for your SEO and generating content available only to people through your site, but reposting helps spread that content around. Refurbishing your content is a happy medium between the two and doesn&#8217;t take much additional effort. Consider both sides when it comes to your blog and the overall health of your website and decide what&#8217;s best for you.</p>

<p>Just about every client I work with has some sort of email marketing program, and yet what goes into every client&#8217;s strategy couldn&#8217;t be more different. From clients in the home services industry, to food and beverage and corporate services, the nuances of making effective emails is a delicate process &#8211; and even a small change can have a huge effect on your <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2015/11/the-comeback-kid/">email metrics.</a> Sometimes, the most effective way to find out what&#8217;s going to work for your particular business is through trial and error. To try to find those sweet spots for both Roundpeg and our clients&#8217; email campaigns, we conduct what we&#8217;ve been calling &#8220;split-list tests.&#8221; If your email campaign is stagnating, perhaps try some tinkering of your own, and we&#8217;ll show you how.</p>
<h3>Setting up the test</h3>
<p>Let me get one thing on the record before we dive in: I am in no way a scientist and I have only worn a lab coat once (and that was to a Halloween party).</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, the best way to run one of these tests is to split your list into random samples. If you want to be super fancy and exact, you could export your entire list into a spreadsheet, assign each contact a number, and then randomly generate groupings, but that&#8217;s not really necessary. We find that splitting a list into two (or more) sections alphabetically gives a good semi-random grouping. An alphabetical sort will also help you control for factors which might influence open rates, such as how long a contact has been a part of your email list, or their average response rate. Also, keep in mind that the more contacts you have in each test list, the more reliable the results you get will be. So if you have a list with only a few hundred names, you may want to focus your energy on building your list before you test different campaigns.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got your test subjects, you&#8217;re ready to experiment. This is the point at which you&#8217;re allowed one evil mad scientist laugh. Go ahead, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>Good job! Now let&#8217;s take a look at some different parts of your email you can change to see what gives you the best results. Note that when you do perform these tests, you&#8217;ll want to change only one of the following components per email. If not, you&#8217;ll conflate the results and be no closer to finding what works best than you were from the beginning.</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The layout of your email is probably the piece of your test that will show the biggest change in results, and rightfully so as it&#8217;s going to be the most difficult to change in a meaningful way. This is where you can go a little wild with your strategy. If your usual newsletter is a smattering of blog excerpts with links to read more, try a more visual approach with images and easily digestible information that more directly invites your audience to click through. Do you usually send out a generic monthly promotion for everyone? Try instead a personalized approach that emulates a personal correspondence, using your contacts&#8217; names and addressing them directly. You&#8217;ll know a change in layout is hitting a good spot if you see a spike in clicks.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of your email is to get your audience to click through to your website and knowing what&#8217;s going to make your audience click more often is invaluable. I recently did a test with one of my clients lists, one of the only changes I made to the email was an additional click opportunity in the form of hyperlinked text which the original lacked, having two large calls to action in the form of a linked image and a button. Surprisingly, I saw almost double the click through rate, primarily going through that hyperlinked text. I realized that this may have been due to the fact that the age of the audience of this email campaign skewed slightly older, thus they may have more readily recognized a text link than an embedded image.</p>
<p>The lesson here is just like with layouts, your audience may respond differently to different link formats. Running these types of tests will help you find what those strong performing formats are.</p>
<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>Though you may not give much thought about what day of the week or what time of day you send out your newsletter, shifting your send time by a day or even a few hours can have a big impact on how it&#8217;s received. Depending on your industry, your audience and more, you may find better results first thing Monday morning or early evenings on Wednesday. Reviewing your open and click rates based on timing will give you a better idea not only when your audience is more likely to look through their inbox, but also when they&#8217;re more likely to engage in pre-purchase behaviors.</p>
<h3>Subject Lines</h3>
<p>You didn&#8217;t really think there woud be a blog post about email without talking about the holy grail that is the subject line, did you? Not a chance.</p>
<p>Testing different subject lines at the same time to different groups can tell you a lot more about your audience than just what words look good in an inbox. Whether you highlight limited-time savings on your product, the latest news from your business or a special event you&#8217;re hosting soon, what you put in your subject line should always provide <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2015/10/whats-in-it-for-me/">something of value.</a> When you split your list and see different open rates with differing subject lines, you&#8217;re getting a glimpse into what your audience finds valuable and worthy of their time. That kind of information is invaluable to increasing your conversions to growing your list, and to an overall more successful email campaign.</p>
<p>Though I could go on about different ideas to test in your emails, the long and short of it is that when it comes to email marketing, it&#8217;s going to take time and effort to find the most effective strategy, and it can be rough going to find your sweet spot. When you do find it though, you&#8217;ll see the real value of email to your overall digital presence.</p>

<p>It’s a struggle.</p>
<p>You have a website that not only looks good but is also easy to use. The content is informative and helpful, and your calls to action (CTA) are artfully placed and speak clearly. Yet for many websites, there’s another pesky addition: ads.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this post, ads are anything that distracts from the main content on a page. This can be a CTA in the footer that doesn’t directly generate revenue but doesn’t tie into the page’s content either. Essentially, a purposeful distraction. How do you make sure your ad isn’t ignored but also doesn’t detract from your page?</p>

<h3>The Best — Hidden In Plain Sight</h3>
<p>“Bad design shouts at you. Good design is the silent seller.” — Shane Meendering</p>
<p>What do people come to your website for? Thinking critically about ad placement is essential to ensuring those ads are seen without causing frustration. As a blog, viewers are coming to read. Putting a video that plays automatically would not only be jarring but could cause the reader to close the window entirely. Same goes for a pop up ad that covers the content.</p>
<p>The best ads are ones that don’t look like ads at all, and social websites have achieved this seamlessly.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">On Twitter and Pinterest, ads look like just another post rather than something to be avoided. If the ad is of genuine interest to you, you’ll read it just like another post. You may even click before realizing it’s an ad at all.</span></p>

<h4>Permitted — Getting the Job Done</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s no avoiding it—an ad demands to be seen and can’t be camouflaged into the landscape of your otherwise beautiful website. When this happens, keep your end user in mind as well as how they view your website. Those YouTube ads are certainly annoying, but <a href="http://www.tubefilter.com/2014/09/04/youtube-paid-advertising/">work</a> because they fit the video format and require watching a few seconds before reaching the intended content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where should you put your ads?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reader’s vision follows an <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-f-layout-in-web-design--webdesign-687">f-pattern</a>, meaning they scan your page from top to bottom, left to right. This is why logos are often in the top-left corner, where they’ll be seen first.</p>

<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">This layout does an excellent job of placing ads purposely without being overly intrusive. The logo is seen first and directs the viewer to the ad below. Another ad is nestled within the article titles, again following the natural f-pattern flow.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">This ad is the easy way out and has no qualms standing in the way. Does it serve its purpose and demand to be read? Sure. However, ads like this need to be designed and styled carefully so they fit in with the page. If it sticks out like a sore thumb, it’ll be scrolled past without a second thought.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">Have I mentioned the f-pattern? On these pages, viewers see the content left to right and land on the ad at the end of the line. This is a better solution since the reader has the choice to linger on the ad or continue scanning the content.</span></p>

<h4>The Absolute Worst — Just Don’t.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These ads are why advertising has a bad reputation. Oddly enough, while researching this topic I found smaller marketing sites to be the worst offenders, and wasn’t inspired to read a single ad let alone click. Avoid these advertising tactics if you want your ads to actually be seen.</p>

<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">Not one, but two CTAs right from the start. When you want a viewer to do something, you have to be<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/designing-for-explicit-choice/"><span style="color: #2ea3f2;">explicit</span></a>.

Effectively the first two banners are wasted, especially with such a prominent image that grabs attention first.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">The point of your website is for viewers to see your content, establishing your expertise and earning the viewers trust. This may lead to action either through a download, signing up for your email or even calling.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">This ad pops up before you can see anything, asking for your trust from the very beginning. Why would I sign up for your newsletter if I don’t even know what you do? Or if it will be any good? Personally, unless I’m really interested in the content or it’s an established source, I close the window reflexively.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 17.85pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #666666;">Dishonesty is not a wise marketing tactic. Lying frequently ends up in loss be it clients, friends or a job. Yet the Internet is riddled with false CTAs. This was the landing page after clicking “download font.” The bright green, all-caps button immediately grabs my attention, and yet the actual download button is nondescript and beneath the image. This ad is designed to trick you to click it so your chosen font will download. Instead another window will open with something entirely different. As a customer, you’ve just been lied to, you will probably leave this site, never to return.</span></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re thinking about a new web design. Heck, if you&#8217;re breathing I bet you&#8217;ve thought about putting up a spiffy website at one point or another. How do you get there from here?</p>
<p>Do one thing for me. Make a wish list. Get an old-fashioned pencil and some paper, or a napkin off the bar if that&#8217;s your zone. Simply write a list of the things you want in a web design. <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2013/12/make-web-design-wish-list/" target="_blank">If you need a little help, here&#8217;s mine from a while back.</a></p>
<p>Another way to approach the web design wish list is to list all the problems or pain points you have with your current website, all the things that need to get fixed.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50726" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the_mast.jpg" alt="Web Design Project Leader" width="807" height="248" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the_mast-300x92.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the_mast-768x236.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the_mast-600x184.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the_mast-610x187.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the_mast.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>Next up, pick a friend to lead the project. Or pick yourself. Either way, your web design project needs a point person. Someone to work directly with the web designer or project manager doing the website.</p>
<p>Most website projects have multiple stakeholders. That is, people who care about the outcome of the web design project. Honestly, keep most of these folks off the conference call. <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2015/06/building-camel/" target="_blank">Otherwise, you might end up with a camel instead of a horse.</a></p>
<p>When you have a project leader, that person can champion the project, gather feedback from the other stakeholders and devote specific hours to providing the resources and feedback required by the web designer.</p>
<p>You can be your own mast on this grand ship of web design. Or you can be the captain and steer. But you&#8217;ll still need a mast to hold up the sails and keep the project moving.</p>
<h2>Carefully Define the Scope of the Web Design</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50725" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/routine_trip.jpg" alt="Define Web Design Scope" width="807" height="248" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/routine_trip-300x92.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/routine_trip-768x236.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/routine_trip-600x184.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/routine_trip-610x187.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/routine_trip.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>Let me tell you a story. Remember ol&#8217; Jack Burton? It was 1986 and he was goin&#8217; down to San Francisco on a regular job. Maybe meet up with his old friend Wang and share a drink or two.</p>
<p>Then Wang&#8217;s fiance from China is kidnapped at the airport, there&#8217;s a big street fight with a bunch of gangs, <a href="https://youtu.be/JM6Z3wgMNlY" target="_blank">these immortal Lords of Death show up</a> and before you know it Jack and Wang are in the hell of upside-down sinners. Rough day.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your little web design project turn into big trouble. <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2012/12/help-me-help-you-5-tips-for-working-with-a-web-designer/" target="_blank">Learn how to work with your web designer</a> to define exactly which features and web design elements are included in the project&#8217;s price. Make an agreement in writing that anything extra is, well, extra. Sign it in blood or ink, your choice.</p>
<p>That way, your web designer has clear direction and you have clear expectations. And if something new turns up, you&#8217;ll have an agreement in place to guide you in taking care of it.</p>
<h2>Embrace Video and Audio Content</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50724" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/music.jpg" alt="Video in Web Design" width="807" height="248" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/music-300x92.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/music-768x236.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/music-600x184.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/music-610x187.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/music.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>The Internet used to be like an awkward scientist party. No music unless you count that dial-up sound, zero eye contact and incredibly long waits to hook up. Things are different now. There&#8217;s great audio and video content everywhere, making everything more fun and more interactive. <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2013/08/how-to-put-videos-on-your-website/" target="_blank">Join the party and include video in your site strategy!</a></p>
<p>Work with a video producer to capture testimonials from your best customers, consider filming your own how-tos. Ask your web designer about adding subtle motion to your backgrounds. Use micro-interactions when appropriate. Those are the little color changes, rotations and other pops of motion when you hit a button. Super fun stuff that we&#8217;ll only see more of in apps and web designs.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t add auto-play music or loud videos.  Those are forever banished. Start paused or silent and give visitors the option to play audio.</p>
<h2>Give Detailed Feedback</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50722" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/creative_genius.jpg" alt="Creative Genius Web Design" width="807" height="248" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/creative_genius-300x92.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/creative_genius-768x236.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/creative_genius-600x184.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/creative_genius-610x187.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/creative_genius.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>You my friend, are a creative genius. The fortune cookie says so. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s actually true: everyone is creative in what they&#8217;re passionate about. You might not be a master painter or web designer, you may be creative in the kitchen, creative with fancy spreadsheets or creative with your family schedule. Bring a little of that to your web design.</p>
<p>You do this by giving detailed, honest feedback. That means pointing out what&#8217;s wrong or out of place the moment you realize it. Creative geniuses don&#8217;t waste time correcting the flaws in their vision. So, tell me how you really feel and leave nothing out.</p>
<p>At the same time, please know that creation is a push-pull activity. Push your web designer, but understand they&#8217;re creative too. In fact, they&#8217;re the <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2014/08/3-experts-small-business-marketing-needs-today/" target="_blank">expert in web design</a>. Be open to their recommendations. When you push and pull in sync, good things happen.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Forget About Website Security</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50723" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/health.jpg" alt="Good Website Security" width="807" height="248" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/health-300x92.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/health-768x236.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/health-600x184.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/health-610x187.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/health.jpg 807w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>Ah, the last and final fortune. Good health to you! In web design, good health starts with security. You don&#8217;t want to get hacked, vandalized or taken over. It&#8217;s disruptive and lame when you have to deal with a broken website.</p>
<p>Harden your website&#8217;s security by using strong passwords for everything. All the user accounts, all the hosting and domain name service accounts, all the extra vendor accounts related to the site, everything. Use at least 8 characters, numbers, letters and symbols mixed up. If your password is easy to memorize then it&#8217;s probably weak.</p>
<p>Second, make sure your website is backed up frequently. At least weekly, more often if you blog or make updates daily. Check with your website host first to see if they already perform this service for you and could easily restore your site from a hack if necessary. If not, or if you&#8217;d like more control over your backup method, there may be additional website software you can use to manually take backups.</p>
<p>Third, consider a website firewall service like Sucuri. Not only will their service keep bad guys out, if the bad guys make it past the firewall, Sucuri will assist in clean up efforts. <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/2014/02/wordpress-security-101-small-business-websites/" target="_blank">There&#8217;s so much more to say about Sucuri and website security in general</a>. But this is all just a fortune cookie, so there&#8217;s not much more space.</p>
<p>What do you think about these fortunes? Is a new web design in your future? Is video content right for you? <a href="http://roundpeg.biz/contact/">Let us know your questions</a>, and we&#8217;ll consult the cookies.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t have all the answers. Yes, I know you come to Roundpeg for your daily dose of marketing information, and we do have a lot of stuff to say. But to stay on top of our game, we check out other blogs, books and videos regularly. Here&#8217;s a sampling of what I have read in the last few weeks.</p>
<h2>Management and Leadership</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.anesecavanaugh.com/can-you-really-have-it-all-how-to-increase-your-odds">Can you really have it all? </a> &#8211;  The short answer is not really, but author Anese Cavanaugh gives you a model to evaluate all that you want and how to get the things which really matter. At the end of the day, it is about choice. What really matters to you.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.eosworldwide.com/blog/puppies-stars-hire-slow-fire-fast#axzz3yxIKHkik">Puppies and Stars</a> &#8211; I have seen this type of decision matrix applied to clients, but never employees. EOS  Worldwide is one of my favorite management blogs. In this post they talk about selecting people who fit your core values, even if they don&#8217;t have all the skills right away instead of hiring people with skills who really don&#8217;t fit your culture.</p>
<h2>Content Marketing</h2>
<p class="story-headline blue"><a href="https://sumome.com/stories/epic-roundup-post?src=inbound-story-epic-roundup-post">Getting 20,231 Views with One EPIC Roundup Post: A Step-by-Step Guide</a> &#8211; If you have noticed a series of roundup posts on the Roundpeg blog, this is the post which inspired many of them. I used to rely on this type of post quite often, but had fallen out of the habit. After reading Tor Refsland&#8217;s post I had to give it a try once again. While I don&#8217;t expect anywhere near that large a response, it will be fun to see how this post performs.</p>
<p class="story-headline blue"><a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2016/01/29/how-to-come-up-with-fresh-ideas-to-write-about-on-your-blog/">How to come up with fresh ideas to write about on your blog</a>  &#8211; I have been a long time ProBlogger fan. I took the 31 Days to a Better Blog Challenge a few years ago, and I still use many of the tactics I learned back then. This post is really just a link to his podcast, but it is a nice introduction to Darren and ProBlogger. I love listening to his Aussie accent almost as much as I enjoy reading what he has to say.</p>
<h2 class="story-headline blue">Just for Fun</h2>
<p class="story-headline blue">By the middle of the afternoon, I am a little burned out. I am tired of reading about web design and SEO or social media and Inbound marketing. I need a mental break. Something which will make me laugh, smile or make me say wow. That&#8217;s when I turn to sites like <a href="http://www.demilked.com/">DeMilked</a>. Some days there is something pretty, cool or just plain weird. <a href="http://www.demilked.com/disney-characters-posters-tim-burton-andrew-tarusov/">This post</a> probably falls into the category of kind of weird. Artist Andrew Tarusov recreates popular Disney posters in the style of Tim Burton. Is there any business application for this topic? Probably not, but it is a fun way to end the post and start your day!</p>
<p class="story-headline blue">So, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s on my reading list, what about you?</p>

<p>You have a website that’s lovely and interesting, but what good is it if the pages load slowly, there are low security protocols which leave you vulnerable to hacks or worst of all, frequent downtime where your site isn’t even visible to your clients?</p>
<p>When it first starts to happen you may ask yourself, &#8220;Is this just a normal thing, and does it happen to everyone?” If the instances of service interruption are few and far between then the answer is yes. The truth is no hosting company can guarantee you won’t ever have a single issue. If, however, these issues happen frequently then you need to rethink your hosting platform.</p>
<p>There are lots of choices from inexpensive to extremely costly with features you may or may not need. There are lots of criteria to consider, one of which is how easy it will be to migrate your data to a new home.</p>
<h2>Moving your hosting to GoDaddy.</h2>
<p>For small business websites there are quite a few affordable hosting packages. One of the most popular is GoDaddy. If you have a simple website and blog it is hard to beat their pricing (hosting packages start at $6,99.month), their unlimited bandwidth and one click installation for WordPress. They have good security, helpful customer service and high up time. All in all a great solution, unless you have more than a simple website.</p>
<p>While we like GoDaddy for many of our smaller sites, we recently regretted the decision to migrate a collection of old sites to GoDaddy.</p>
<p>In this instance, we had more than one WordPress installation to migrate. GoDaddy does have an option for multiple WordPress installations but it is significantly more expensive and our client wanted to go the more affordable route.</p>
<p>Given the amount of time we spent (and had to bill for) to migrate everything manually, I am not sure that was the best choice. To do this we downloaded all their files, folders and even their databases via FTP and save them to our server. Then we had to turn around and upload everything to their new server on GoDaddy.</p>
<p>Once everything was in place we made a quick call to GoDaddy support to get the databases set correctly and repoint the domains to the new servers.Remember, I did say they had good service.</p>
<h2>When you are ready for more, WP Engine.</h2>
<p>The Roundpeg website was launched 14 years ago this month. So much has changed since then, from the design of our site to our hosting requirements. With thousands of visitors every week, we rely heavily on our website to represent us favorably to prospective clients. Up time and page load speed are absolutely critical and our hosting provider wasn&#8217;t keeping up. We evaluated a few different platforms and decided on <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine<span style="color: #000000;">.</span></a> This was a step up for us in performance and in pricing. Our account now costs $29/month, but more robust programs from WP Engine are available ranging in price from $99 &#8211; $249/month.</p>
<p>Among the deciding factors was their server which seems to move at light-speed so photos and videos load in a flash. For image and video heavy sites (much larger than ours) they offer a CDN (content delivery network) which provides high stability and high speed when loading each page. It is nice to know the capability is there if we ever need to upgrade.</p>
<h4>Ready for the move:</h4>
<p>Our site seems simple on the surface, but looks are deceiving. We actually have 75 pages, almost 3400 blog posts and a media library with more than 3,000 images, downloads and audio files. That is a lot of content to move. WP Engine has detailed step by step tutorial that helped us make the transition easily. There was no messing with individual files, folders or even databases.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-50645 size-full" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP-Engine-Migrate-e1454443913945.png" alt="WP Engine Website Hosting Tool" width="750" height="365" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP-Engine-Migrate-e1454443913945-300x146.png 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP-Engine-Migrate-e1454443913945-600x292.png 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP-Engine-Migrate-e1454443913945-610x297.png 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP-Engine-Migrate-e1454443913945.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Of course nothing ever goes right the first time, so we had to work out the knots. (Important lesson, don&#8217;t try this first thing in the morning!) Migrations should always be done whenever your web traffic is the lowest. For us that means late afternoon. The glitches gave us a chance to test out their support team. They were definitely up to the task, walking through our issues, explaining what we needed to fix and how to make the adjustments.</p>
<p>So we made the move and so far we are extremely happy. Our page loads quickly and we haven&#8217;t had to call our host to report our site was down. If you&#8217;re thinking about a web redesign, take some time to think about your hosting program as well.</p>

<p>In most industries clients come and go. Even highly engaged clients that really seem to be excited and interested in the service you&#8217;re providing might take some time away. It happens for a wide variety of reasons; lack of time, lack of staff, lack of funds, but whatever the reason, sometimes those clients come back. Holding a grudge isn&#8217;t going to do anyone any favors, keep a level head and a few of these things in mind when a long-lost client comes back to transition back into a happy, healthy working relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Forgive and move on</strong> – People get busy. Especially people that are running their own business. If they leave, most of the time it isn’t personal. If they decide to come back, the easiest way to get back to work quickly is to put the past in the past and take the next step forward. If the client is really interested in getting back to business, it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem to pick up where you left off. There is an ebb and flow to all working relationships and sometimes they need time to put out other fires. Stay consistent, clearly communicate what you need and move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t throw their stuff out</strong> – Like after a bad breakup, your first instinct is to get rid of all of their junk, well sometimes they come back and you’re going to need all of the graphics, contact information and previous work you have done for them. Keep all of the materials you&#8217;ve collected in one place where you can access it if you need it. Even if they don’t come back, it’s a good idea to have this work on hand as reference, or for the past client in case they need it.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware of old habits</strong> – Before they left you probably had come to a comfortable working relationship and rhythm. The kinks were, for the most part, sorted out and your timelines were consistent. Jumping back  in with both feet does not mean that those old issues won’t resurface, be aware that you might have to re-establish those standards.</p>
<p><strong>Keep the lines of communication clear</strong> &#8211; To prevent this from happening again, be very clear about what you will do for them, but also what you need from them. The easiest way to keep the train running smoothly is to make sure everyone knows what&#8217;s going on and how we can keep from derailing again. Take the past as a lesson and make sure you know the best way to get in contact with them and their preferred communication style. The longer you know a client, the better you know how they operate. If you feel them pulling away again, clear communication will go a long way.</p>
<p><strong>Help them move on &#8211; </strong>Sometimes you have to acknowledge that you and a client just aren&#8217;t working out. This can happen in a variety of ways, just like any other relationship. Maybe your client has grown and you don&#8217;t provide the new services that they are looking for. Maybe it&#8217;s you that has changed and working with this client isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s best for your company. Either way, the best thing you can do is help them move on. As a professional in your industry, you most likely know plenty of other businesses that could be a better fit if things don&#8217;t work out. Suggesting a company that can better meet their needs is the best way to help everyone.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to bring clients back if they have taken some time away, but also, be aware of signs that this relationship isn&#8217;t working out. Professionally, it&#8217;s never a good idea to burn bridges. Even if you don&#8217;t see the potential of working with a client ever again, good rapport will help down the road with other potential clients. We all get busy from time to time, be aware of what your clients are going through and make the effort to move forward, when or if they come back.</p>

I can be indecisive about which covers I choose, but there is one type that I always steer clear of when I have the chance.</p>
<h3>The dreaded movie tie-in.</h3>
<p>I once heard someone say something along the lines of &#8220;one way in which it&#8217;s ok to be snobby is refusing to buy the movie tie-in cover of a book,&#8221; and I couldn&#8217;t agree more. There&#8217;s nothing sadder than a great book cover design which has been replaced by a tacky movie scene, and believe it or not, sometimes I don&#8217;t want to look at Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Here are a few covers that make me particularly unhappy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50658" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG_Bookcover.jpg" alt="GG_Bookcover" width="795" height="375" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG_Bookcover-300x142.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG_Bookcover-768x362.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG_Bookcover-600x283.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG_Bookcover-610x288.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG_Bookcover.jpg 795w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></p>
<h3>The Great Gatsby:</h3>
<p>This is probably the most iconic book cover in the history of American literature, people. If aliens landed on earth and saw this artwork, I&#8217;m pretty sure they would recognize it immediately. There should be a strict policy that states no other designs for this cover can ever be printed. Carey Mulligan and Leo look great, but if anyone needs to see their faces in order to be interested in this book, they probably aren&#8217;t going to enjoy the story to begin with. A little-known artist, Francis Cugat illustrated the original cover, and the art itself was written into the book. Redesigning the cover seems like an exercise in futility at this point.</p>

<h3>Never Let Me Go:</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite books of all time (so please let me know if you&#8217;d like to borrow it.) The plot of this book is so subtle and chilling as it follows a group of children growing up in an extremely unconventional (ie. terrifying) boarding school. Summarizing it any further would spoil it, but trust me, it&#8217;s unsettling. The movie tie-in cover isn&#8217;t horrible, but when I see Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan (again) running across a dock this feels like a Nicholas Sparks love story. The version on the left does a better job of capturing the innocence and bewilderment of the characters, who we meet as young children.</p>

<h3>Anna Karenina:</h3>
<p>I really don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to imply this story is just about a woman choosing between two men. Sure, there is love in the book, and certainly some risqué infidelity, but it&#8217;s all pretty destructive and ends in a lot of sorrow and isolation. The original cover isn&#8217;t necessarily my favorite design, but it very much seems to reflect the heavy story inside. The movie tie-in cover also insists on practically screaming about the book being made into a movie, which seems like a cheap trick.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50660" src="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WFE_Bookcover.jpg" alt="WFE_Bookcover" width="795" height="375" srcset="http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WFE_Bookcover-300x142.jpg 300w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WFE_Bookcover-768x362.jpg 768w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WFE_Bookcover-600x283.jpg 600w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WFE_Bookcover-610x288.jpg 610w, http://roundpeg.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WFE_Bookcover.jpg 795w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></p>
<h3>Water for Elephants:</h3>
<p>This is an example of a good book, bad movie and the cover very much reflects that. Robert Pattinson is a lovely person, I&#8217;m sure, but he should not be on the cover of anything you would like readers to take seriously. Also, why am I seeing the entire plot before I&#8217;ve even opened the book? The original cover gives me all the information I need. There is a circus, and probably something shady is going on.</p>
<p>I think the issue I have with most movie tie-in covers is that they really seem to dumb down these amazing stories, and assume we are only interested because our favorite A-lister was involved in the movie adaptation. I would never want to discourage anyone from picking up a book for any reason, so if that&#8217;s what gets someone interested in reading, so be it. However, with that being said, I&#8217;m going to keep going out of my way to find the book with the best cover possible.</p>

<p>I came to the office on a Saturday morning with just three things on my to do list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a proposal</li>
<li>Compile summary notes after a client meeting</li>
<li>Write copy for an ad</li>
</ul>
<p>What I did instead</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote two blog posts. I was inspired and wanted to get the ideas out before I forgot. I really like the two blog posts.</li>
<li>Got caught up on my accounting &#8211; It was the end of the month, and I wanted to know how we finished up. I balanced the checking and credit card statements. I actually enjoy doing a little math.</li>
<li>Tested a new floor cleaner on our hard wood floors. In a 65 year old building our floors are a little worse for wear. I bought a bottle of Bona and wanted to see how the floors would look if I used it instead of water. They look a lot better, and I am definitely going to make sure my cleaning crew only use that from now on.</li>
<li>Cleaned up our email lists. I have wanted to do some tests on our email with different designs and different offerings, but the first step was the list clean up and now that is done.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a productive few hours. So when I left, I felt good about all I had accomplished. Everything I spent time on was a good, worthwhile activity. Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t the best use of my time. Those three really important tasks didn&#8217;t get done. Like many small business owners, I allowed myself to be distracted and never got around to doing the things which really needed to be done.</p>
<p>My morning was the perfect example of what author Jim Collin meant when he said &#8220;Good is the enemy of great.&#8221; If we spend too much time on the wrong things, there is no energy, time or resources left over for the really great things. The things which will move your company forward. So how do you find time for the great things?</p>
<h2>Create a to do list and stick to it.</h2>
<p>Make a list of all the things you need to accomplish. Then set priorities. Decide which are top priority and put those on the top of the list. Set time aside for these specific activities. And don&#8217;t compromise. Unless the building is on fire, spend the allotted time working on the things you have identified as most important.</p>
<h2>Use tools but don&#8217;t expect them to solve the problem.</h2>
<p>I use Insightly to collect and organize my tasks. While this helps, unless some part of the program will reach out from the computer and slap me when I go to work on something else, I can&#8217;t rely just on a software product. The solution has to come from me.</p>
<h2>Reward yourself</h2>
<p>Sometimes we avoid tasks because they aren&#8217;t fun, take too much time or are simply boring. One of the first things you need to do is figure out why you are avoiding the task. If it is going to take too much time, break it in to smaller steps. Set aside a little time each day to work on it. Then give yourself a reward when you finish part of the project.</p>
<p>What should your reward be? Maybe it is a walk outside, a few quick minutes on social media, a piece of chocolate or a conversation with someone you have been meaning to catch up with. A little positive reinforcement goes a long way when it comes to motivating us to work on things we don&#8217;t want to do.</p>
<h2>Delegate</h2>
<p>I have this amazingly talented team, and they can do lots of stuff if I will just ask. As a business owner, sometimes I feel like it has to be me and other times I don&#8217;t really want to push off a small task. But I just need to get over it. If I want the business to grow I need to be spending my time on the things which will make us great.</p>
<h2>Back to work</h2>
<p>So I have enjoyed writing this blog post, but now it is time to get back to work. What about you? How do you manage your time?</p>
