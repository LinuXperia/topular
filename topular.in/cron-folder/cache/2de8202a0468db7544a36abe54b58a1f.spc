<p>My January PetBox features $52 (before shipping!) of great items from companies like Scout &amp; Zoes and PrideBites, all of which you can get for just $39. It&#8217;s a deal for pet parents and a delight for pets.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more!</p>
<p>Each Blue III PetBox that&#8217;s purchased supports the Butler University live mascot program.</p>
<p>Can this deal get any better?</p>
<p>Oh yes it can! Did I mention this all comes in an attractive cardboard PetBox? As you know, I learned a thing or two from the authority on cardboard box destruction, the late Butler Blue II, and believe me, the contents of the PetBox isn&#8217;t the only fun to be had when one arrives in the mail. (see photo below)</p>

I can&#8217;t thank the PetBox people enough for reaching out to me in support of Butler&#8217;s live mascot program. Thankfully, a co-owner of the PetBox company is a Butler grad, so they had my back the whole time and I&#8217;m proud to represent their product.</p>
<p>Hey, they know a good thing when they see it and so do I!Â Yep, I truly believe that you will be impressed when your PetBox arrives in the mail. I know your pet will be anyway!</p>
<p>After all, just look at what makes a PetBox the best:</p>

</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a list, and I&#8217;m proud to say that we&#8217;re adding to it again, this time courtesy of Indianapolis-based contractor and construction firm, Shiel Sexton who have built me a <strong>custom dog house</strong>, inspired by historic Hinkle Fieldhouse. I don&#8217;t have it yet and I&#8217;ve only seen pictures, but the big reveal and presentation will occur on Friday, Oct. 11, 2013 at Shiel Sexton. Then I get to bring it home, to campus, and have it on display at the Bulldog Beauty Contest presented by Built Ford Tough Trucks and Butler&#8217;s homecoming football game against the Campbell Camels.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to show it off and tell folks all about it, but for now, the dog house is maybe best described by Butler grad and Shiel Sexton employee, Nick Schellinger, who oversaw the build:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>From the moment we were approached by Butler University about building Trip a new dog house, we couldnât wait to start designing and digging in to the construction of it &#8211; we were âall inâ. We set out with a few main goals in mind, we wanted the house to be functional, mobile, and the best looking dog house college sports has ever seen.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>Luckily for us, the design was a no brainer, Butler already has one of the greatest homes in sports with Hinkle Fieldhouse and we decided it was only fitting for Trip to have his very own Hinkle âdogâ house. We built the house to be as much like the real thing as we could, complete with the barrel roof and the iconic rafters. Since this house was going to be home to one of Americaâs most beloved mascots, we knew that a regular wood floor just wouldnât do. A hardwood basketball court floor, painted just as the real court in the Fieldhouse, was put in instead.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>To bring it all together, we worked with the University staff who created the images for the exterior/interior and we had vinyl wraps of those created and applied. We knew Trip would love being in his new home so much that we put the entire roof on hinges; this way his adoring fans could still get a glimpse of him even when he was inside his Hinkle âdogâ house. Lastly, we put wheels on the house and retrofitted a cart so that it can travel anywhere Trip may venture out to in the BIG EAST and beyond.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><em>This was a special project for us at Shiel Sexton and we had a great time working through every aspect of taking this house from a vision to a reality for Trip and Butler University.</em></p>
<p>Well done, Nick and Shiel Sexton! And gratitude goes to a handful of others that played a part in this awesome build, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Butler student and art &amp; design major, Amber Mills, who designed and created the exterior and interior images.</span></li>
<li>Stan Charles and his team at Stan&#8217;s Sign Design who supplied the exterior and interior vinyl wraps.</li>
<li>The Cincinnati Flooring Co. who not only did the original floor inside Hinkle Fieldhouse, but my dog house floor too!</li>
<li>AAA Roofing who supplied a well-buit, &#8220;retractable&#8221; roof.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? I can&#8217;t wait to show it off. Speaking of, I hope to see you all on campus for homecoming this weekend. The fall colors are coming on, the weather forecast is perfect, our fall sports teams are on fire, and the school spirit on campus is at a fever pitch.</p>
<p>Join us early this Saturday at 10:00 a.m. for the Bulldog Beauty Contest presented by Built Ford Tough Trucks (looking to have 100 bulldogs participate again), then enjoy the parade, hit the tailgates, and cheer the Dawgs onto victory. Â Oh, and check out my new dog house too!</p>
<p>Go Dawgs!</p>

I miss him terribly.<a href="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Blue-and-Trip-Nap-Time.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-2589" alt="Blue and Trip Nap Time" src="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Blue-and-Trip-Nap-Time-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Blue-and-Trip-Nap-Time-150x150.jpg 150w, http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Blue-and-Trip-Nap-Time-300x300.jpg 300w, http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Blue-and-Trip-Nap-Time-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Blue-and-Trip-Nap-Time.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>However, this transition has maybe been easier on me than anyone else. After all, I learned from the best, so I&#8217;m confident in my training to follow in Blue&#8217;s illustrious footsteps. But more than that, when Blue II passed, he did so as a legend; setting the bar for not just live mascots at Butler University, but live mascots around the world.</p>
<p>So when we said our goodbyes that Saturday morning, August 31, 2013, we did so with a peace of understanding. Blue II, satisfied with a job well done, knew that this was the circle of mascot life. And by that point I had come to understand that it was my time to lead the charge, knowing full well that I would someday (hopefully long from now) also be in Blue&#8217;s position, saying goodbye to my successor.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just the &#8220;business&#8221; side of things. Beneath all of that, Blue knew that his best days were behind him. He was hurting and he was tired. He wasn&#8217;t willing to quit keeping on, but it wasn&#8217;t fair to him to fight such a losing battle. All the while, I was hurting for him. It was stressful to see a dog so strong become so humbled and weak. I knew he was suffering. I knew it was time. We knew it was time.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Pay-Homage.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2594" alt="Pay Homage" src="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Pay-Homage-225x300.jpg" width="180" height="240" srcset="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Pay-Homage-225x300.jpg 225w, http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Pay-Homage-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Pay-Homage.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></a>I&#8217;ll never forget that morning he left our home and never came back. I got busy right away being the family pet and mascot he would&#8217;ve wanted me to be. When my parents came home from that arduous task, I turned on the charm, reassuring them that everything was going to be alright. And ever since, when it has been time to go to campus, run the football team on the field, pose for pictures, or just be there for a student who needs a little therapy, I&#8217;ve done my best to emulate the legend, Blue II.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px">So it&#8217;s been quite a month. I thank you all for accepting me as your mascot in the wake of Blue II&#8217;s passing. Your support has made the transition easy. Â </span></p>
<p>Speaking of support, your response to Blue II&#8217;s passing has been incredible and very healing. We have received tweets, e-mails, messages, texts, cards, hugs, handshakes, gifts, flowers, and an overall outpouring of support beyond measure. Even in his passing, Blue II still had a way of bringing the Butler community together. That&#8217;s the stuff of legends!</p>
<p>And they say that legends never die. Well, I suspect Blue II&#8217;s legendary status will reach Paul Bunyan-like proportions with future crops of students telling tall tales about his escapades. Regardless, thanks to your support, his memory and likely his legend, will live forever through a new <a title="Butler Bulldog Memorial" href="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/bulldog-memorial/" target="_blank">Bulldog Memorial</a> on campus.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much in the way of <a title="Bulldog Memorial Architectural Schematic" href="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/files/2013/09/Bulldog_Memorial_Plan-Revised-Dimensions.pdf" target="_blank">imagery</a> or details for the memorial yet, but I can say that thanks to your support, it is a done deal. We will have a live mascot memorial on campus to pay tribute to those bulldogs who have gone before me, and those who will follow in my steps as well. The coolest part though, is that there will be a bronze bulldog sculpted in Blue II&#8217;s likeness that will reside at the memorial. That&#8217;s pretty legendary.</p>
<p>When I have more details and images for the memorial, I&#8217;ll be sure to share. Until then, rest assured, your support will soon make the memorial a reality on Butler&#8217;s campus.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&#8217;ve said about enough. Not bad for my first blog post! Oh yeah, that&#8217;s what I got on here to tell you in the first place&#8230;I&#8217;m taking over Blue&#8217;s blog now. I am a &#8220;Blue,&#8221; so naturally the name will remain the same. The blog will now just be filled with insights from yours truly and in honor of a legend, of course.</p>
<p>Go Dawgs!</p>

I sense the end is near as my heart rate is increasing in an effort to capture more precious oxygen. Frankly, itâs hard work and quite exhausting. I wish I felt better, but Iâve known for a while that my best days were behind me.</p>
<p>So while I still have a little stamina left, I thought I would pen one last blog post for Pops to post after Iâm gone. I know itâs morbid and sad, but given my hospitalization and near death experience just a few weeks ago, Iâm lucky to still be around to do this.</p>
<p>So with that, I say thank you. Over the last nine years, the Butler faithful have not only accepted me as their official mascot, but your pride in me has also made me Americaâs Dog. Iâve said it before and Iâll say it again, no dog has lived such a charmed life.</p>
<p>I owe a debt of gratitude to so many. I say thank you to everyone affiliated with Butler University, to my fans all over the world, my sponsors, my medical staff, my friends, and most of all, my family. Itâs been and honor and a privilege to serve as your mascot and THE Butler Bulldog.</p>
<p>Iâve done my best to leave my mark on the job and this great University. I hope that Iâve left this place better than I found it. Regardless, I have no regrets as I gave it my all.</p>
<p>I hope that you will <a title="Blue II - In Memoriam" href="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/butler-blue-ii-in-memoriam/" target="_blank">remember me fondly</a>, and when you do think of me, youâll think about what I would want you to do for Butler University.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I do have one last request. My friends at Butler have lovingly planned a Bulldog Memorial to honor and remember me, the live mascots who came before me, and the lucky Dawgs who will follow in my footsteps. While the plans are still coming together, I can tell you that the memorial will include a bronze bulldog sculpted in my likeness, as well as a brick doghouse where my remains and those of my successors will reside eternally. Fittingly, the memorial will be prominently situated in the shadows of Hinkle Fieldhouse, easily accessible for all to enjoy.</p>
<p>The graduating class of 2013 got the ball rolling this past year by committing their senior class gift toward the project. We have a long way to go, however, so please consider adding your support to the <a title="Butler Bulldog Memorial" href="http://blogs.butler.edu/butler-blue/bulldog-memorial/" target="_blank">Bulldog Memorial</a>. Large or small, <a title="Bulldog Memorial Gift Form" href="https://secure.www.alumniconnections.com/olc/pub/BUU/onlinegiving/showGivingForm.jsp?form_id=158849" target="_blank">your contribution</a> would mean the world to me. Knowing that my friends and fans are a bunch of overachievers, any funds raised beyond those needed for the Bulldog Memorial will support my home away from home, Hinkle Fieldhouse.</p>
<p>So with that, Iâm signing off for good. Iâm handing the reigns of this blog over to my successor, partner-in-crime, and adopted brother, Blue III (Trip). He has great character, is really holding his own as mascot, and is gracefully following in my footsteps. Show him the same love that youâve shown to me and the kid is going to be just fine.</p>
<p>Again, my sincere thanks for nine incredible years. My work here is done. God bless Butler University and Go Dawgs!</p>
<p>Your Mascot,</p>
<p>Butler Blue II</p>

Well, to no surprise, I seem to be the dog version of that phenomenon.</p>
<p>After logging a nine-year career as the official mascot of Butler University and hanging up my custom Nike jersey this past May, it seems that my good health decided a retirement was in order as well.</p>
<p>By June, my body had started working against me, though it wasnât outwardly apparent, until a little scratch formed on my shoulder. Pops thought it just a harmless bite mark or scratch, a souvenir from roughhousing with Butler Blue III (Trip). But when the surface area of the wound increased, Pops determined an appointment with Butler alumnus, Dr. Kurt Phillips at Mass Ave Animal Clinic, was in order.</p>
<p>When I got in to see Dr. Phillips, my âwoundâ had not only increased in size, but I started to develop more of them. And when Dr. Phillips shaved the area, it really became apparent just how serious these skin lesions were</p>
<p>After diligent work by Dr. Phillips, involving many tests, analysis of lab values, and some research, it was finally determined that I had developed Cushingâs Disease. To summarize, Cushingâs Disease occurs when a tumor forms on the pituitary gland in the brain, which sends mixed messages to the adrenal glands, which in turn causes the immune system and body to get out of whack.</p>
<p>As of last week, both Dr. Phillips and my dermatologist, Dr. Lori Thompson (Animal Dermatology Clinic of Indianapolis) were both confident in both my diagnosis and my long-term recovery.</p>
<p>As this point, we thought I was on the upswing, so my parents left Trip and me behind for a much-needed mini-vacation this past weekend. However, when they returned home on Sunday evening, they could tell I had taken a turn for the worse. My Calcinosis Cutis (skin nastiness) had not only worsened, but I wasnât eating, my gums and eyes were pale, my front legs and paws were significantly swollen, my breathing was quickened/shallow/labored, and I lacked the strength to do much of anything. I take that back; I was strong enough to insist on a ride in my Burley Trailers Tail Wagon Ride. Still, my parents and I both knew something was up.</p>
<p>After consulting with Dr. Phillips, we thought it would be best to visit a 24-hour animal care facility late Sunday evening. So Pops loaded me into the Blue Mobile and off we went to Circle City Vets where it was found that I had developed fluid around my lungs and in my chest cavity, known as pleural effusion. So they tapped me like a keg and got busy draining it out.</p>
<p>I spent the night at Circle City Vets and was discharged on Monday morning with strict orders to head to the Purdue University Small Animal Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. At Purdue, Dr. Yang and her colleagues confirmed the pleural effusion and started treatment. Meanwhile, a cardiologist conducted an EKG to further evaluate the condition of my heart.</p>
<p>Iâve lived a transparent life, both on social media and out and about in the public eye for nine years. I figure thereâs no reason to stop that now. So itâs with a heavy, slightly compromised, but still ticking heart that I tell you that Iâve been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), affecting both the left and right side of my heart.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, I have heart failure (no connection to the Cushingâs Disease). Itâs maybe a bit ironic for a dog thatâs been all-heart over the last nine years to develop heart disease, but then again, itâs probably no coincidence that my heart has been maxed out.</p>
<p>As our coaches often say to the Butler student-athletes, âLeave it all on the field!â I certainly left it all on the field and frankly, I wouldnât change a thing. In fact, Iâm not certain thereâs ever been a dog to live a life as charmed as mine.</p>
<p>No doubt, my diagnosis and subsequent prognosis is grim, but thanks to the great care Iâve received, Iâve recovered enough to be able to head home to be with those I love.</p>
<p>So the bad news is I have irreversible heart disease, and itâs likely I wonât be back to Butler any time soon. The good news is, I feel much better, Iâm eating well, and I have some more time to spend with my family. Iâm a lucky Dawg!</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dr. Phillips and his staff for their tireless efforts to treat me. Additionally, credit goes to Dr. Thompson of Animal Dermatology Clinic of Indianapolis, the staff at Circle City Vets, and of course, Purdue University.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank all of you, my fans and the Butler community, for your support, not just during this difficult time, but also over the past nine years. This surely isnât goodbye just yet. Iâll still be on Twitter/social media, around to give my kid brother, Trip, a hard time, eating all of the ice cream that is allowed, and of course, going for rides in my most prized possession, that Burley Trailers Tail Wagon.</p>

(He also has a practice in downtown Indianapolis at the Mass Ave Animal Clinic.) It was a great event with the usual attributes, cake, balloons, picture-taking, but there was also a very poignant moment that took me by surprise, when Dr. Phillips presented me with a toast.</p>
<p>It was so touching and heart-felt, I asked if I could share his remarks on this blog for my fans to read. Certainly, it&#8217;s a piece that makes me feel good, but more importantly, I think it illustrates the commitment and care I have received from Dr. Phillips over the years. Enjoy the read.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kurt Phillips &#8217;92 &#8211; Woodland Animal Hospital/Mass Ave Animal Clinic &#8211; April 13, 2013</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Iâd like to welcome you all here today to celebrate with Blue II as he sails off into a restful and relaxing retirement after nine great years of service to Butler University as our official mascot.Â  I am so very happy to see all of you here today:Â  friends, colleagues, clients, patients, family and Butler fans and supporters.Â  It is an honor to play a small role in Butler&#8217;s mascot program and I am glad that you all came out today to support it and Blue II.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Nine years ago, I met Michael Kaltenmark and the new puppy that was slated to be the second official mascot for Butler.Â  I had reached out to the university 2 years prior to that when Blue I was on the scene and offered to be her veterinarian.Â  I had the most wonderful four years of my life attending Butler in the late 80âs/early 90âs and I wanted to give back to the University.Â  I figured this was the best way I knew how to do that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">I was so thankful when Kelli Walker, Blue Iâs caretaker, called me back to say that she would be delighted to bring Blue I up to Carmel from campus for her veterinary care.Â  Blue I, as many of you know, was a cool dog, but her tenure at the University only lasted a few years.Â  When Kelli decided to move to the west coast, Blue I went with her and luckily, her breeders (Frank and Jeane King) were willing again to donate a second puppy to the University.Â  This is where Blue II, the dog we all know and love, came onto the scene.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">From the start, this dog grabbed everyoneâs attention and worked his way into our hearts.Â  My family has such fond memories of hanging with Blue II at football and basketball games and events such as the Bulldog Beauty Contest.Â  We remember the fun times having him in our home when Michael and Tiffany needed some time away.Â  We loved coming to campus and seeing him roam around with Michael; always enjoying the love and affection of student and visitors to campus alike.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Blue II has been so completely successful in becoming âAmericaâs Dogâ mainly because of his awesome good looks, his wonderful temperament and his winsome smile.Â  But in addition to these awesome qualities, Blue II has become everyoneâs favorite mascot largely in part due to the amazing upbringing, training and love that he has been shown by the Kaltenmark family:Â  Michael, Tiffany and most recently: âMaster Everettâ.Â  Without this amazing family, Blue II would have turned out like any other college mascot:Â  a dog in a kennel only shown to the public during halftimes of major sporting events.Â  Instead, Blue II lives in a loving home with amazing people.Â  He goes to work everyday to Butlerâs campus (a place that I consider home)Â  and he is surrounded by loving supporters every day, all day.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Blue II has attended countless sporting events from lacrosse games to soccer matches to being a mainstay at Hinkle fieldhouse for severalÂ  amazing seasons of Butler Basketball.Â  He has his own Facebook page and a Twitter account with more than 12,500 followers!!!!Â  He has appeared on national television numerous times and has been highlighted in countless newspapers throughout the years.Â  His popularity is mainly due to his personality and looks, but his dad, Michael has been integral in getting him this national recognition,Â  and oh yeah. . . two back to back runs to the Final Four by our menâs basketball team surely didnât hurt!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Throughout these amazing nine years, I have been honored and blessed to be a part of this dogâs journey.Â  A deep friendship has developed between the Kaltenmark family and my own and for that I am eternally grateful to Blue II.Â  I am so very proud of the moniker, Americaâs Dog, that has been bestowed upon Blue II and he deserves it.Â  Blue II, not only our you âAmericaâs Dogâ, but I claim you as âmy dogâ as well.Â  You are a part of my family, the Woodland Family and the family of so many adults and children who love you so very much.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">So, it is without further adieu, that I would like everyone to raise their glasses to Americaâs Dog.Â  May you sail off into retirement with the love and support of your family and friends, with your new buddy, Trip, at your side and a big rawhide bone to carry with you whereever you go.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">To Blue II !!!!</p>
<p>Not much more to say to that, but thanks and cheers! Dr. Phillips, you&#8217;re the best!</p>
<p>Some dogs are deathly afraid of going to see the vet. I absolutely love going to see Dr. Phillips and his staff and now you can see why. Dr. Phillips always takes great care of me, so much so that I feel like I could keep on going as mascot. But it&#8217;s time to hang it up, so I&#8217;ll take my title as America&#8217;s Dog and enjoy watching Blue III (Trip) do all the work.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>For their efforts, the category winners will receive a $20 gift certificate to the Butler University Bookstore and our overall winner gets a brand new 16 MP Nikon CoolPix digital camera, complete with a 16 GB memory card pre-loaded with hi-res photos of me! Not bad for a little tickle of the keyboard, right? It pays to enter my contests.</p>

<p>Without further adieu, my third installment of &#8220;What I&#8217;ve Learned&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Butler Blue II: What Iâve Learned (March 27, 2013)</strong></p>
<p>Mascot, 9, Indianapolis</p>
<p><em>Butlerâs mascot, Americaâs dog, shares a dog&#8217;s eye view on the eve ofÂ retirementÂ after nine years of honorable service.</em></p>
<p><strong>I knew retirement and transition were all a part of the gig,</strong>Â but I&#8217;d be lying if I said that I didn&#8217;t severely underestimate it.</p>
<p><strong>Dragging me off the Hinkle Fieldhouse floor</strong>Â may have been necessary after the Changing of the Collar Ceremony if I wasn&#8217;t soÂ obedientÂ  I love that place. Those basketball games are the best part of the job.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long road to wisdom, but a short one to being ignored.&#8221; </strong>Pops listens to a lot of music and that lyric by The Lumineers has been echoing in my furry head for some time now. So simple, but so true.</p>
<p>Speaking as a being that is completely reliant upon the hand of humans, The story of the &#8220;GoodÂ Samaritan&#8221;Â needs to become required reading, for all of humanity. After all, what have you done to help a complete stranger lately?</p>
<p><strong>If doing a good deed requires praise</strong>Â <strong>or notice</strong> from someone other than your own conscious, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Butler Blue III is proof</strong> that that youth is wasted on the young.</p>
<p><strong>As much as I hate to say it, sometimes people just need to cut Butler Blue III some slack.</strong> He&#8217;s a pup. He&#8217;s a seven-year-old version of a you, and you went looking for trouble when you were seven.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s both nice and annoying to be so adored by your little brother.</strong> I didn&#8217;t ask for it, but at the same time, the kid could be a lot worse. It&#8217;s all peaches and cream for Blue III until the day Blue IV shows up. Then he&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><strong>My veterinarian recently noted</strong> that I&#8217;ve aged more in the last year than I had the previous seven combined. Â I can&#8217;t argue with that observation.</p>
<p><strong>If my body would allow it,</strong> I&#8217;d never give up this gig, but then ignoring my body would contradict the wisdom I&#8217;ve gained over the years. From a quality of life standpoint and longevity&#8217;s sake, it&#8217;s time to hang it up.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t get around as well as I used to,</strong> but I still make a point to get up and greet those special to me.</p>
<p><strong>Who I am, the mascot I&#8217;ve become, is nine years in the making.</strong>Â People forget that. In some respects, Butler Blue III is further along at his age than I was. He&#8217;ll be just fine. Only time will tell if he&#8217;ll pass my wins,Â accolades, and decorations, but that has nothing to do with being a serviceable mascot.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t know whoÂ originallyÂ said it,</strong> but &#8220;avoid biting when a simple growl will do&#8221; are some excellent words to live by.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m low to the ground.</strong> I see things from a different perspective, and what I&#8217;ve found over the years is that success lies in the details. I&#8217;m not saying you need to sweat the small stuff, but I am suggesting that you mind the little things. In an over-the-top world, it is the details that make all the difference.</p>
<p>Follow your instincts.</p>
<p><strong>Do you ever notice how dogs never pretend to be someone or something that they&#8217;re not?</strong> It seems to work for us. Be genuine.</p>
<p><strong>Another old dog proverb says,</strong> &#8220;If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.&#8221; As a stubborn bulldog, I can especially relate. Â And after all, &#8220;Bulldogs ever do or die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Loyalty. It&#8217;s not just for dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Generally speaking, I have no regrets,</strong> but I still wish we could&#8217;ve captured one of those men&#8217;s basketball NCAA titles. While I wouldn&#8217;t trade those experiences for the world, that&#8217;s still sometimes a hard pill to swallow.</p>
<p><strong>Butler University will move on without me, but I&#8217;ve cemented my spot in it&#8217;s history. Go Dawgs!</strong></p>

<p>Nestled in the middle of <a href="http://museumrowonmain.com/">Museum Row on Main</a> in downtown Louisville, the Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory is instantly recognizable. Towering 120-feet into the air, the Big Bat separates the Slugger Museum from other, seemingly normal neighbors.</p>

<p>Butler Senior <a href="https://twitter.com/refenton">Rob Fenton</a>Â was a fantastic tour guide. He knew his stuff and Pops just ate up all the baseball history.</p>
<p>From this year&#8217;s Silver Slugger Awards to wax figures, unfinished billets, an order of bats for Brandon Moss of the Oakland Athletics, to an old-school working lathe, to laser guided machines, and even the original Babe Ruth model bat in the bank vault, we saw it all and it was pretty darned cool.</p>

<p>Much love to Louisville Slugger for not only giving us the VIP treatment and tour, but for the personalized bats. So cool and something you can get to, by checking out their <a title="Louisville Slugger Personalized Bats" href="http://www.sluggermuseum.com/personalizedbats/" target="_blank">special order site</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in Louisville and have any appreciation for baseball, wood working, or history, then a stop at the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory is a must!</p>
<p>It was just a great experience and one that is perhaps best summed up in pictures. <a title="Blue II's Photo's from Louisville Slugger" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/butlerblue2/sets/72157632472693468/" target="_blank">Check out some of my shots from the experience</a>.</p>

<p>Now keep in mind that The Huffington Post boasts a Pulitzer Prize and was ranked #1 on the 15 Most Popular Political Siteslist byÂ <i>eBizMBA.Â </i>Meanwhile, Mashable not only one of the world&#8217;s larges websites, but the leading technology blog and is hugely influential with more than 2 million monthly unique visitors and 5 million monthly page views. So just slightly more than my blog.</p>
<p>And this all begs the question, what did your college mascot do this week?</p>
