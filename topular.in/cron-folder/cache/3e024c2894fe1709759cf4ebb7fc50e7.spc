A departure from his synth-heavy work as one half of electro-pop duo Carousel, Day Wave crafts dreamy, lo-fi, guitar-driven indie- pop that is already turning heads. With a modest but top-quality catalogue of a five-song EP and limited run 7&quot;, Phillips &ndash; who writes, produces, and performs all of his songs, and tracks each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel, no less &ndash; is currently working on his debut LP and live show. Having already claimed multiple #1 Artist slots on Hype Machine and the Zane Lowe/Apple Music seal of approval with his lauded &#39;Headcase&#39; EP, in addition to play list adds on Alt Nation, XMU, KCRW (including Jason Bentley&rsquo;s Morning Becomes Eclectic), KEXP, WXPN, and more, Day Wave shows no signs of slowing down.

                                        Painted Palms&#39; second full-length album, Horizons, exudes a sense of confidence and purpose that is only present when two creators share a singular focus and absolute trust in each other&rsquo;s talents.

On Horizons, emotional states are suspended between light and dark, driven by the tension of efficient song structures. From the first ominous harmonies of lead single &ldquo;Refractor,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s clear that Painted Palms&rsquo; panoramic pop sound has never been more fully realized.

Though vocalist Chris Prudhomme and producer Reese Donohue chose to collaborate on their second full-length by sending song ideas back and forth over e-mail, just as they did when crafting their 2014 debut Forever, Horizons marks the first time the duo has expanded their sound beyond the bedroom by stepping into the studio.

Mixed by former DFA house engineer Eric Broucek (LCD Soundsystem, Classixx), Horizons engages with a diverse sonic palette on each track: &lsquo;60s psych-pop, &lsquo;80s synths, hypnotic vibes of the kind induced by Bjork and early &lsquo;90s Creation Records bands, and the trunk-rattling minimalism of Southern hip-hop.

                                        ESCORT is big. Literally. Enjoying accolades ranging from the New York Times to Pitchfork, the &quot;disco orchestra&quot; features an incredible cast of musicians including founders/producers Eugene Cho and Dan Balis, and fronted by lead singer Adeline Mich&egrave;le. Performing in a variety of powerful party line-ups, the band performs live from a core 5-piece (with Adeline on bass) to a 10+ member extravaganza.

Escort burst on to the scene in 2006 with a string of critically acclaimed 12&quot;s that included future classics &quot;Starlight&quot; and &quot;All Through The Night&quot;, both DJ staples that get still get plenty of play on dancefloors. As DJs nursed their electro-clash hangover with a seemingly never ending stream of disco edits, Escort stood out, in part, by creating dance music the old fashioned way: with impeccable production, musicianship, and songwriting.

The following several years saw them bring the same uncompromising approach to their live show. In an era where dance music is dominated by samples and computers, Escort took a sprawling ensemble to the stage and developed a reputation as one of New York&#39;s most compelling live acts, capable of performing their elaborate recordings note for note.

Escort&#39;s &quot;Cocaine Blues&quot;, a brilliant reinterpretation of the 1976 Dillinger classic received rave reviews and quickly became an underground sensation, leading up to Escort&#39;s long awaited self-titled debut LP. The entire album is steeped in the venerable tradition of clubland&#39;s holy trinity &mdash; New York, Chicago, and Detroit &mdash; but it seems particularly reminiscent of mutant-pop luminaries such as Kid Creole and the Coconuts and Ian Dury, who somehow managed to translate their sardonic sensibilities to the dance-floor. And by embracing the legacy of these forward-thinking but classic acts, they have yet managed to create something strikingly new.

Early returns on Escort&#39;s yet to be released sophomore album have been equally glowing. Escort&#39;s anthemic &quot;Barbarians&quot; and soaring dance floor cut &quot;Cabaret&quot; have further established Escort at the very forefront of modern disco. Breaking bread to DJs and partygoers that need more than a steady diet of 909s.

Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears recently described Escort as the &quot;best disco you&#39;ve ever heard.&quot; He just might be right.

                                        In honor of Women&#39;s History Month, we&#39;re celebrating the female artists and artisans of California while also giving back to our community. Gothic Tropic, Everyone is Dirty and Peachelope will be bringing the rock and roll while our favorite local, female-run businesses run pop-up shops upstairs! Come on out and show your solidarity with women. Everyone is invited!

We&#39;re collecting tampons, pads, and other feminine hygiene products for the Compass Family Shelter, because every woman should have access to these necessary care items. Periods are tough enough to deal with, even if you can afford them.

We&#39;re also holding a clothing drive for La Casa de Las Madres, a safe house for women and children fleeing from domestic violence. Here&#39;s how it works: Bring that bag of clothes you&#39;ve been meaning to donate, we&#39;ll take the clothes to Community Thrift Store and make the donation under La Casa&#39;s name, Community Thrift then transforms our donation into shopping vouchers for the families in their programs.

                                        Los Angeles&#39; Gothic Tropic introduces bona fide originality to the world of indie-pop. The brainchild of Cecilia Della Peruti, Gothic Tropic keeps the vibe playful, effervescent and punchy, offering a new brand of female fronted, guitar-driven music. Della Peruti&rsquo;s electric performance brings audiences into a new era of female rock nobility, nodding to stars like Debbie Harry and Chrissie Hynde, and a blend of Richard Lloyd and Nile Rodgers on guitar.

&quot;Perhaps the most appropriately named band of the fest, Gothic Tropic sound like if the Rolling Stones had chosen to seclude themselves in Cuba, not rural France, to escape personal hardships and record their landmark album, Exile on Main Street. Psychedelic reverb pop with afro-cuban beats and melt-worthy vocals dressing up some of the best songwriting to hit this year&rsquo;s festival.&quot; --Sled Island

                                        &#39;You don&rsquo;t really need to be an enigma once Beyonc&eacute; has introduced you to the world, but Boots doesn&rsquo;t care about mystery as a gimmick. After all, his real name and appearance are out in the open. Born Jordan Asher, the 28-year-old songwriter got his break when Beyonc&eacute; heard his demos and tracked him down to collaborate on her self-titled album. He won&rsquo;t say how she found him or why she selected him from the seemingly infinite sea of aspiring producers. He got lucky. That&rsquo;s all we know. 

Motorcycle Jesus the film takes place in a potentially post-apocalyptic hellscape, and Motorcycle Jesus the EP follows suit. Boots sings of guns, daggers, dead bodies, and devils. Danger creeps around every corner of this little world. &ldquo;Get that evil off my screen,&rdquo; he sings on &ldquo;Mercy&rdquo; over muted flickers of guitar. &ldquo;Cancel the future/ Put it on hold.&rdquo; The song erupts into an electric coda complete with guitar solos and handclaps &mdash; not the corny, celebratory kind, but the kind that egg you on while you&rsquo;re sprinting from the gas explosion behind you.&#39; --Consequence of Sound

                                        Sertab Erener is a Turkish pop music singer and also a cross-over soprano with a vocal range that extends to high F. She is one of the most successful female Turkish pop singers in her homeland, and is considered one of the divas of Turkish pop music. In Europe, she is best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with her hit song &quot;Every Way That I Can&quot;, although she has had many other achievements outside Turkey.

A native of Istanbul, Erener studied opera before beginning her musical career working with Turkish music icon, Sezen Aksu.
She released her first album, Sakin Ol, in 1992, and followed it with four more Turkish-language albums over the next decade. Her album L&acirc;&#39;l was included by Sony Music in its &quot;Soundtrack for a Century&quot; collection.

                                        Le1f is always looking toward the future. Since the release of his debut mixtape Dark York in 2012, the Manhattan-raised rapper born Khalif Diouf has been renowned his circles and across the media for pushing boundaries with everything from lyrics, the technicalities of his flow and his beat choices. Producers are only now catching up to the sound of its first single &ldquo;Wut.&rdquo; With an almost-lifelong background in ballet and modern dance, as well as a degree in dance from Wesleyan University (where he honed his music skills, learning production on FruityLoops and ultimately creating the beat for Das Racist&rsquo;s breakout &ldquo;Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell&rdquo;).

With Dark York, Le1f commanded attention from both the rap and dance music worlds&mdash; although his vibrant curiosity with his ample footwork, the deep cadence of his voice, his ability to both tell stories and flex in his lyrics and an undeniable sense of forward-thinking in his music. The subsequent release of his Fly Zone and Tree House mixtape, a collaborative EP with producer Boody called Liquid released via Boysnoize and his Terrible Records debut EP Hey furthered that narrative. But with his first full-length Riot Boi (Terrible/XL) finds Le1f finalizing the vision.

                                        Le1f is always looking toward the future. Since the release of his debut mixtape Dark York in 2012, the Manhattan-raised rapper born Khalif Diouf has been renowned his circles and across the media for pushing boundaries with everything from lyrics, the technicalities of his flow and his beat choices. Producers are only now catching up to the sound of its first single &ldquo;Wut.&rdquo; With an almost-lifelong background in ballet and modern dance, as well as a degree in dance from Wesleyan University (where he honed his music skills, learning production on FruityLoops and ultimately creating the beat for Das Racist&rsquo;s breakout &ldquo;Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell&rdquo;).

With Dark York, Le1f commanded attention from both the rap and dance music worlds&mdash; although his vibrant curiosity with his ample footwork, the deep cadence of his voice, his ability to both tell stories and flex in his lyrics and an undeniable sense of forward-thinking in his music. The subsequent release of his Fly Zone and Tree House mixtape, a collaborative EP with producer Boody called Liquid released via Boysnoize and his Terrible Records debut EP Hey furthered that narrative. But with his first full-length Riot Boi (Terrible/XL) finds Le1f finalizing the vision. Drawing inspiration from the Riot Grrl Movement and artists like M.I.A. and Missy Elliott, the album is both a celebration of marginalized identities but without slipping into the divisive territory of &ldquo;conscious rap.&rdquo; In his own words, he&rsquo;s &ldquo;somewhere between an activist and an antagonist.&rdquo;

Riot Boi features guest appearances from fellow innovators Junglepussy, House of LaDosha and Dev Hynes, as well as production from PC Music&rsquo;s SOPHIE on the first single, coquette club anthem &ldquo;Koi.&rdquo; Le1f has received accolades from press on the cutting edge like Vice, The FADER, FACT Magazine and Pitchfork and has been featured in Vogue, Interview and BuzzFeed. But he is not just being noticed for his own artistry and his impeccable taste and prescience for the future of rap and R&amp;B is deftly displayed through artists like Rahel, Donchristian and more signed to his own Camp &amp; Street label.

                                        Cascades, the title of the second record from the Brooklyn group High Highs, could be read in a number of ways. It could be taken as a nod to the group&rsquo;s hometown&mdash;the coastal Australian city of Sydney, which rests against the beautiful, blue Pacific Ocean. Or it could be a nod to the record&rsquo;s sound, which retains the broad scope of the group&rsquo;s debut, Open Season, but feels bigger, and grander &ndash; sheets of sound, raining down softly. In reality, though, the title is a memory &ndash; a moment Jack Milas and Oli Chang remember while driving through the Cascade Mountains on tour. The song it comes from, also called, &ldquo;Cascades,&rdquo; is bright and expansive, silver threads of guitar laced through soft layers of synths. It builds softly and steadily, Milas&rsquo;s voice swooping up to an aching falsetto on the chorus, synths pooling gently beneath him. More than anything else, the song is an indication of how far the group has come in a short period of time &ndash; from working together in a recording studio in Australia to opening for Sky Ferreira and Vampire Weekend. Cascades is a portrait of a band in ascent, making music grand enough to carry them along the way.

&ldquo;The first album was intimate,&rdquo; Chang says. &ldquo;We were piecing together ideas in a small space with guitar and voice. With this record, we wanted to make songs that were fuller, that would fill a bigger room.&rdquo; Milas puts the same sentiment more succinctly: &ldquo;We wanted to have a bit more fun.&rdquo; That sense of freedom rings throughout the record. On &ldquo;How Could You Know,&rdquo; guitars streak across the background like shooting stars as Milas employs an elegant falsetto to convey longing and hope. In &ldquo;Movement,&rdquo; vocal harmonies ripple and sway over hymnlike synths; and &ldquo;Fastnet&rdquo; is a slinking, synthetic soul song, high, beckoning vocals gliding across tiny apostrophes of guitar. Cascades is the sound of a band stretching out, writing songs that feel purposeful, effortlessly melodic and full of grace and beauty.

                                        Naked Giants are a threepiece garage rock wildebeest from Seattle, WA. Grant Mullen&#39;s bluesy guitar solos, Henry LaVallee&#39;s pounding backbeats, and Gianni Aiello&#39;s juicy basslines combine to form a psychedelic whirlwind of fuzz. Their friendship ties together their various influences to curate a different take on the traditional garage rock sound. Unlike what you&#39;ve heard before, their spontaneity and their stylistically diverse catalogue sets Naked Giants apart from the cutandpaste garage outfit. They bring together sounds influenced by the likes of Ty Segall and the Sonics as well as Pink Floyd and even Spinal Tap with an audible energy that gets any crowd doing the twist.

The band jumped into Seattle&#39;s music scene by playing shows to hip teens in museums and to sweaty college kids in packed house shows, and have carried the same pure rock&#39;n&#39;roll energy regardless of the audience or venue.

                                        Crywolf, otherwise known as Justin Taylor Phillips, is a producer, vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist from Los Angeles,CA. Since Crywolf&#39;s conception three years ago, his intimate, melodic, avant-garde releases have garnered their own unique following, with a loyalty rarely seen in the world of electronic music. His releases are no stranger to commercial success either; met with support from international acts such as Ellie Goulding, Skrillex, Bassnectar and more. His first three EPs all charted in the top 3 on itunes and secured spots on the Billboard charts for over two weeks. His most recent effort, Cataclasm has been hailed as his best work to date, debuted top 10 on Billboard electronic, and has been covered by major media outlets such as Billboard, Vice, DJMagazine, and more. With over 40 million total plays across online streaming platforms such as Pandora, SoundCould, Youtube, and Spotify, and a tour for his new live set on the way, 2016 is set to be a huge year for Crywolf.

                                        Parissa Tosif and David Ansari are Canberra/Seattle-based electronic duo Vallis Alps.

Their music blends down-tempo, piano-driven melodies and acoustic guitar with 80&#39;s pop synths and gritty trap beats to compliment their half-nostalgic, half-foretelling lyrics.

Since releasing their independent self-titled debut EP in Jan 2015, the pair&#39;s mesmerizing tunes have clocked over 2+ million SoundCloud plays (27, 000 of which appeared in the first 24 hours) and peaked at #1 on Hype Machine upon release. On the strength of their music alone, Vallis Alps were named as triple j Unearthed, AIR and FBi Radio feature artists and were more recently included as Zan Rowe&#39;s &#39;Song You Need To Hear&#39; on CBC&#39;s Public Radio Picks. They also continued to make their mark on the Aus iTunes Electronic Album and Singles Chart for &#39;Young&#39; at #2 and #23 respectively, debuting in the Top 100 ARIA singles chart &ndash; an impressive feat for a new independent act.

                                        HOMEGROWN AFROBEAT, AFROROCK, REGGAE, AND ORIGINAL BAY AREA FUNK!

These purveyors of original Afrobeat, Reggae and Funk music are dance floor veterans, with current and former members of Spearhead, Afrolicious, Katdelic and Broun Fellinis among them.  They will get you moving with their funky rhythms, draw you in with their soulful singing, and carry you away with their spirit-filled solos.

Guitarist/Singer David James (Spearhead, The Coup, Beth Custer) brings his sinewy style to counter the funk-metal stylings of lead guitarist Ken House (H.P. Riot). The precise funk-rock drumming of Paul Oliphant (Will Magid, Smoked-Out Soul) with Wendell Rand&#39;s (Afrolicious, Youssoupha Sidibe) muscular dance grooves keep the band tight, while saxophonist David Boyce (Broun Fellinis) and trombonist Alan Williams (Manicato, Afrolicious) wail, their horns producing a sound that encompasses outward-bound jazz, classic reggae, afrobeat and R&amp;B.  Percussionist Brandon Lee thickens and adds flavor to the mix, and on top of all this, Sandy House adds her sultry voice and powerful stage presence.

                                         The release of his latest album Dumb Flesh in May 2015, and an ongoing European tour have kept the electronic maverick Blanck Mass (aka Benjamin John Power of F*ck Buttons) very busy. The album was solely written, produced and recorded by Benjamin in a number of different locations over the space of a year. As a work of art, Dumb Flesh is a comment on the flaws of the human form in its current evolutionary state.

 The follow-up is the incredible 33 minute EP, The Great Confuso, recorded at the end of summer 2015. Consisting of the colossal new title track piece, which runs at over 18 minutes in three parts (featuring guest vocals from Throbbing Gristle/Psychic TV legend Genesis P-Orridge), and three previously released Dumb Flesh remixes -- &ldquo;Dead Format&rdquo;, &ldquo;Detritus&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;No Lite&rdquo; remixed by Dalhous, Konx-Om-Pax &amp; Geneses P-Orridge respectively.

 Following the cancellation of his previously scheduled 2015 United States tour dates, Blanck Mass is pleased to announce he will be returning to the United States with tour dates throughout March 2016. 

 It was once suggested that everything we as human beings have ever achieved is merely the culmination of our refusal to acknowledge, or accept our own mortality: a vain, pathetic grasp at immortality via the fatuous notions of legacy, society, family, tradition, art. Whatever. In the greatest traditions of folklore, Blanck Mass summons forth the entity sardonically named The Great Confuso to embody the taunting cruelty of death, and the unknowable beyond. This is the ambitious and gloriously uncomfortable aural propagation of looming disaster.

 Dark, glorious and by turn pulverizing industrial metal and hypnotic synth-wash soundscape, this is Power&rsquo;s most thrilling work to date. The obsession with human frailty so central to his previous work is focused here on the themes of confusion, anger and surrender. If Dumb Flesh depicted the frailty of the human body, this EP illustrates the fragility of the human mind. Dispassionate and candid, stark and bold, ferocious and tender, The Great Confuso stands as a new electronic masterpiece.

                                        To put it bluntly, Lust For Youth&rsquo;s International is unrecognizable as a Lust For Youth record on first listen. Hannes Norrvide&rsquo;s previous solo albums under the Lust for Youth moniker have been described as &ldquo;dark, cold, atonal, tormented, lonely, and lower than lo-fi.&rdquo; The approach on International has shifted dramatically. Writing as a three-piece now, with longtime live collaborator Loke Rahbek and new band member Malthe Fischer, who produces and plays guitar, LFY have entered a completely new territory. The result is stunning. International is a buoyant synth masterpiece in the vein of early Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys and New Order. Norrvide&rsquo;s work has always had pop sensibilities buried deep in the reverb, but the hooks are front and center on International, and there is nothing lo-fi about it.

That is not to say the record is without substance. There are still some deeply introspective moments as well, notably the instrumental passages &ldquo;Ultras&rdquo; and &ldquo;Basorexia,&rdquo; which evoke the morning-after loneliness that a lot of earlier LFY work has explored. According to Rahbek, &ldquo;the record sort of happened by chance. Hannes and I had talked about recording some stuff together for the fun of it, and Malthe offered to help us record. Initially, we were just going to do a song or two for the fun of it, but within a few weeks it was obvious that it was a combination that worked. Malthe went from recording to joining within the first few days and we made the whole thing over the last half-year, drinking gin and tonics everyday in the studio. The period was strange, terrible things happened in everyone&rsquo;s life outside of the studio, so as a result many hours were spent in the studio, like a safe zone.&ldquo;

                                        NYC&#39;s The Prettiots are Kay Kasparhauser and Lulu Prat. While they&#39;ve been playing shows and writing songs together for over a year &ndash; all the while earning press fans like Bust, Nylon, Rookie, Noisey, and the New York Times &ndash; their first official release, a 7&quot; single for &quot;Suicide Hotline,&quot; was released this June via label home Rough Trade Records. NPR Music&#39;s review of that track goes far to characterize The Prettiot&#39;s sensibility: &quot;&#39;Suicide Hotline&#39;, like many Prettiots songs, couches stunning barbs of insight between sweet, fun harmonies and playful ukulele strums.&quot; 

As Kasparhauser explained in a Rookie Magazine interview earlier this year, &quot;My lyrics are completely honest...they&#39;re 100% true to my thoughts at any given moment. I like to talk about Werner Herzog and sex.&quot; In that same interview, she admitted to musical influences as wide- ranging as Eyehategod, Lightning Bolt, and ABBA; the latter might be a little easier to glean from the music of The Prettiots, though they&#39;ve been known to cover The Misfits and System Of A Down live.

&quot;Smooth. This is how best to sum up the music by Andy and James, the London-based duo behind soulful electronic group HONNE. With a sound you can&rsquo;t help but nod your head to, each song has the ability to both emulate and mute city life.&quot; --Idol Magazine

The 24-year-old artist known as Petite Noir still lives part-time in Cape Town, close to his family and his spiritual roots and that culture is immediately evident as it bleeds through his music. La Vie Est Belle / Life Is Beautiful, named after an uplifting 1987 Congolese film, is both a beacon and a vessel of inspiration, offering empowerment to those who need it. &quot;

Though Petite Noir&#39;s musical background ranges from guitar metal to nu-disco, he has since developed into a confident, future-facing singer and songwriter with a wide palette. He discovered the work of Kanye West around the age of 16, and it quite literally changed his life, showing him the importance of breaking musical boundaries. You can hear that fearlessness: The King of Anxiety blended raw post-punk energy with sunny African rhythms and nuanced R&amp;B touches in early 2015, and now La Vie Est Belle / Life Is Beautiful takes that sound to louder, more defiant places. But even as explosive pop songs like &quot;Best&quot; and &quot;Just Breathe&quot; delve into depths of frustration and discontent, they&#39;re underpinned with a restless joy. The combination is at once exhilarating and reassuring.

Inspired by innovators like Mos Def and legends Fela Kuti and Tabu Ley, Noirwave encompasses a &quot;new African aesthetic,&quot; plain and simple.

                                        Japan Nite is an annual showcase of Japanese bands at SXSW in Austin, which has introduced over 100 bands to the world from 1996 to present. Following SXSW, the tour visits the Eastern United States, which includes New York, Chicago (and sometimes Boston or Cambridge) then West, to California. It is the coolest Japanese indie rock, punk and obscure culture extravaganza in the world.

                                        Methyl Ethel is the uninhibited alt-pop project from Perth musician Jake Webb. The band started in 2013, as an outlet for the reverb soaked home recordings Webb was working on whilst developing his ambient and textural guitar playing in a variety of local outfits. Methyl Ethel has since blossomed into one of the most critically revered and publicly embraced acts coming out of Western Australia in some time.

Built from the ground up in various bedrooms, friends&#39; studios and quiet caverns over 2013, the exceptional EP diptych Guts and Teeth, which explore themes of anxiety, disillusionment and stasis, were released in quick succession. These intricate tapestries of melody, dripping with lush eccentricity, ascended through the ether and onto the airwaves, with Indie Shuffle, Happy, triple j, FBi Radio, 3RRR and RTRFM amongst others all taking note.

So far, 2015 has seen the band hone their sound, on debut LP Oh Inhuman Spectacle and its accompanying singles Twilight Driving and Rogues (awarded 2015 WAM Pop Song of the Year). Recorded in the same manner as its predecessors, Oh Inhuman Spectacle masterfully blends pop and esotericism to create an undeniable piece of work, which has landed at the top of many mid-year album lists and been championed by supporters new and old.

After a year of relentless touring, sharing stages with the likes of San Cisco, Holy Holy, Sunbeam Sound Machine and Courtney Barnett, Methyl Ethel are now a headliner in their own right. With their hometown album launch hitting capacity in a matter of minutes, and their Melbourne date selling out weeks in advance, the excitement surrounding the act and their breathtaking live show is palpable. October will see the band take a break from working on the follow up to Oh Human Spectacle to head stateside for CMJ, with a busy Australian summer to follow.

                                        For most, a brush with death would be cause for retreat, reflection, and reluctance, but Seattle band La Luz found something different in it: resilience. Having survived a high-speed highway collision shortly after releasing their 2013 debut LP It&rsquo;s Alive, La Luz, despite lasting trauma, returned to touring with a frequency and tirelessness that put their peers to shame. Over the past year-and-a-half of performing, the band arrived at a greater awareness of their music&rsquo;s ability to whip eager crowds into a frenzy. In response, frontwoman Shana Cleveland&rsquo;s guitar solos took on a more unhinged quality. The basslines (from newly-installed member Lena Simon) became more lithe and elastic. Stage-dives and crowd-surfing grew to be as indelible a part of the La Luz live experience as their onstage doo-wop-indebted dance moves.

When it came time to record Weirdo Shrine, their second album&mdash;due out August 7th&mdash;the goal was to capture the band&rsquo;s restless  live energy and commit it to tape. In early 2015, Cleveland and Co. adjourned to a surf shop in San Dimas, California where, with the help of producer/engineer Ty Segall, they realized this vision. Tracking most of the album live in shared quarters, La Luz chose to leave in any happy accidents and spur-of-the-moment flourishes that occurred while recording. Cleveland&rsquo;s newly fuzzed-up guitar solos&mdash;which now incorporated the influence of Japanese Eleki players in addition to the twang of American surf and country&mdash;were juxtaposed against the group&rsquo;s most angelic four-part harmonies to date. The organs of Alice Sandahl and the drumming of Marian Li Pino were granted extra heft and dimension. Thematically, Cleveland channeled Washingtonian poet Richard Brautigan on &ldquo;You Disappear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oranges,&rdquo; and sought inspiration from Charles Burns&rsquo; Seattle-set graphic novel Black Hole.

The resulting album is a natural evolution of the band&rsquo;s self-styled &ldquo;surf noir&rdquo; sound&mdash;a rawer, turbo-charged sequel that charts themes of loneliness, infatuation, obsession and death across eleven tracks, from the opening credits siren song of &ldquo;Sleep Till They Die&rdquo; to the widescreen, receding-skyline send-off of &ldquo;Oranges&rdquo; and its bittersweet epilogue, &ldquo;True Love Knows.&rdquo;

In describing Weirdo Shrine, Segall remarked that it gave him a vision of a &ldquo;world&hellip;burning with colors [he&rsquo;d] never seen, like mauve that is living.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Oranges,&rdquo; the Brautigan poem which inspired the aforementioned track of the same name, the poet writes of a surreal &ldquo;orange wind / that glows from your footsteps.&rdquo; These hue-based allusions are apt: the sound of La Luz is (appropriately) vibrant, and alive with a kaleidoscopic passion. Weirdo Shrine finds them at their most saturated and cinematic.

                                        When Aaron Maine looks back on his early work as Porches, he&rsquo;s often struck by how sad and angry it can feel. &ldquo;That music turned out a lot more pessimistic than I intended it to be,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But when I took a sad moment and turned it into a song, it was a cathartic, positive, and clean process. For me, those moments were victories. Feeling better,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;was making a song.&rdquo;

As it turns out, Maine is very good at making songs. Over the last few years, the 27-year-old singer and songwriter has released a wealth of material on a number of influential labels, including singles on Terrible (2014&rsquo;s Prism), Birdtapes (2013&rsquo;s Townie Blunt Guts) and Seagreen (2014&rsquo;s Leather), as well as a beautiful yet crushing full-length on Exploding in Sound (2013&rsquo;s Slow Dance In The Cosmos). And in the process he&rsquo;s become a magnetic live presence while playing out in New York, gaining the notice of discerning listeners and labels alike. February 2016 marks the much-anticipated release of Pool, his debut full-length for Domino and a major step forward for him&mdash;as an evolving singer/songwriter, and as a nascent producer. Written and recorded almost entirely in the Manhattan apartment he shares with his partner and frequent collaborator, Greta Kline a.k.a Frankie Cosmos, Pool is an elegantly drawn set of gorgeous, synth-driven pop songs that were influenced, in part, by settling in the city as an artist and a person.

                                        Not long after he finished recording Beach Music, his seventh full-length and Domino debut, Alex Giannascoli found himself in unfamiliar territory. &ldquo;I took the record to a studio,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to get it mixed and mastered by some pros. But I was really nervous&mdash;usually, I&rsquo;d just do everything myself and then put it out myself. I have this really precise vision and the best understanding of what I want to do.&rdquo;

Over the course of six self-recorded and mostly self-released LPs, that vision has come to bear in frequently breathtaking, innately melodic forms. As Alex G, the Philadelphian singer-songwriter has built and feverishly shared a body of work unassuming in its presentation but astounding in its depth, a stream of recordings so rich and expansive that settling on a favorite song is nearly impossible: The moment you finally choose one, you discover another you hadn&rsquo;t heard yet.

Beach Music was written and recorded in Giannascoli&rsquo;s apartment, between the Fall of 2014 and the Spring of 2015, during breaks from touring with the likes of Elvis Depressedly, Cymbals Eat Guitars, and Gardens &amp; Villa. While its predecessors often came in uninterrupted bursts&mdash;from his head to his Bandcamp page in a matter of hours and days&mdash;Beach Music was shaped in part by Giannascoli adapting to life as a touring musician. Songs were written within months of one another rather than all at once, with influences ranging from noise music to piano-based laments to Southern rock to the rhythmic focus of techno&mdash;whatever he happened to be most interested in at the time. &ldquo;Every song is coming from a different place,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It branches off in all these directions, but it has its own sound. It&rsquo;s not something I do intentionally, but I&rsquo;m the common thread.&rdquo;

The result is Giannascoli&rsquo;s most cohesive and beautiful work to date, as heard in the iridescent guitars of &ldquo;Bug,&rdquo; the starlit whispers of &ldquo;Mud,&rdquo; and the singularly strange harmonics of &ldquo;Brite Boy.&rdquo;

                                        Madrid-based garage rockers Hinds started as a duo of Carlotta Cosials and Ana García Perrote. Shortly before releasing their first single &ldquo;Demo&rdquo; in 2014 the duo became a four piece, with close friend, ex guitar player and singer Ade Martín on bass and one of their first fans, Amber Grimbergen on drums. During the rest of the year and throughout 2015 they embarked on their first world tour, playing everywhere from Thailand, Vietnam and Australia to the United States to the worldwide festival circuit, including SXSW (in which they played 16 concerts in just 4 days), Glastonbury and Burgerama. They have received very positive reviews in Pitchfork, Pigeons and Planes, Gorilla vs. Bear, Paste, SPIN, Entertainment Weekly and NME.

Their debut album, Leave Me Alone, made its way into the world on Friday, January 8, 2016 via Mom + Pop Music.

Fresh off their release, Hinds is receiving praise for their work. &ldquo;This great garage-rock crew from Madrid folds decades of naïf-rock history into its craftily shambling tunes,&rdquo; said Rolling Stone. Pitchfork suggests its &ldquo;[Carlotta] Cosials and [Ana] Perrote&rsquo;s shared vocal responsibilities, which fit perfectly together&rdquo; that &ldquo;truly set Hinds apart.&rdquo; Entertainment Weekly calls Hinds &quot;...the year&#39;s buzziest indie breakout,&rdquo; while SPIN asks &ldquo;Whether seeing Hinds live, or listening to their debut album, Leave Me Alone, one question always comes to mind: Can I join?&rdquo;

                                        Anyone looking for an all-encompassing statement-of-purpose for SOFT, the hyper-caffeinated new record from Rathborne will find it in the first line of the second song when Luke Rathborne &ndash; chief songwriter and principle persona &ndash; hiccups, &quot;Heard you gotta get it in motion.&quot; From that moment on, SOFT never stops moving bounding from one jagged-edged neo-New Wave song to the next, marrying the fast-and-loose ethos of The Ramones with the coiled neurosis of early Devo and the melodic ease of classic R.E.M. and Tom Petty. 

That maturity is evident throughout SOFT, a story of heartbreak and redemption that told in spit-shined Buddy Holly vocal melodies. Produced by Rathborne and Emery Dobyns (Antony &amp; the Johnsons, Battles, Noah &amp; the Whale), with mixing and co-production by Gus Oberg and The Strokes&#39; Albert Hammond, Jr., the record nestles honey-sweet hooks inside tangles of guitar and Darren Will&#39;s percolating bass.

                                        Matador Records is thrilled to announce that it has signed Car Seat Headrest and will release Teens of Style on October 30, with Teens of Denial to follow soon after in 2016. This prolific artist (n Will Toledo) comes to Matador having already crafted an 11-album catalog of staggering depth, all self-released on Bandcamp, which has gained him an obsessive following and over 25,000 downloads - all without the muscle of a manager, label, agent, or publicist - until now.

Car Seat Headrest began in 2010 in Will Toledo&#39;s hometown of Leesburg, Virginia. Needing a place of solitude (and soundproofing) where he could record vocals undisturbed, a 17-year-old Toledo set up shop in the family car. Toledo&#39;s catalogue is sharp, literary, and culturally omnivorous as it touches upon youth and death, love and depression, drunken parties and 2nd century theologians. Ever surprising, his lyrical imagery ranges from playful to sexually frank to sorrowful, often within the same song.

After relocating to the Seattle suburbs in 2014, Toledo assembled a lineup with bassist Ethan Ives and drummer Andrew Katz. Teens of Style is the first Car Seat Headrest album recorded with a full band, and the sound is vibrant and powerful, with a wide stylistic range.

On Teens of Style, Toledo has taken material from the first three years of the band&#39;s existence and reworked it to generate some of the most realized arrangements to date. Drawing material from 3 (2010), My Back Is Killing Me Baby (2011), and Monomania (2012), Teens of Style provides a concise overview of the band&#39;s many sonic and emotional facets, with the songs ranging from electronic psychedelia to punky anthems to melancholic acoustic numbers.

                                        Mothers began in 2013 as the solo project of Athens, Georgia-based visual artist Kristine Leschper while she studied printmaking at the Lamar Dodd School of Art. The discipline instilled in her a strong work ethic and an intense focus to detail, while simultaneously inspiring her to pursue other creative aspects of her personality. A self-taught songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Leschper&#39;s earliest musical influences span a great swath of early aughts rock and folk, such as Sufjan Stevens, Joanna Newsom, The Microphones, and Athens legends Neutral Milk Hotel; she later developed a love for experimental music, math rock, and noise artists, including Lighting Bolt, Hella, Don Caballero, and Tera Melos. As a result, her earliest demos exhibit a sense of striking catharsis under non-traditional song structures, which flirt between strength and vulnerability, and are often quite linear in form.

Leschper wrote the majority of the songs that would evolve into When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired while finishing art school in early 2014. Fittingly, as while her attention to visual art and music come from very different creative spaces for her, each cannot help but bleed into one another. The delicately resolute opener &quot;Too Small For Eyes,&quot; which she says is about &quot;being incredibly uncomfortable in your own body and learning how to relate to yourself,&quot; even shares its title with that of her senior thesis project. 

The album&#39;s bookends perhaps most explicitly display this musical chronology. The gorgeous &quot;Too Small For Eyes&quot; was the only one of a few solo songs Leschper had written on the mandolin that made it onto the album, its use of space, piano, strings, and her voice entwining and undulating to elegantly set the stage for what unfolds afterward; closer &quot;Hold Your Own Hand&quot; blooms from its plaintive opening bars to an ascendant, spirally waltz to an uproarious math-y breakdown, hinting at the louder, more post-rock and math rock-influenced sound for which their live show is fast becoming known (the blog Heartbreaking Bravery described one of the band&#39;s CMJ sets as &quot;&hellip;intricate, knotty indie pop songs that are equally unpredictable and enticing&quot;). &quot;Copper Mines,&quot; the first song they wrote together as a band, captures the new mix of everyone&#39;s voices and energy on tape, and also informs their other new material, such as &quot;No Crying in Baseball,&quot; a home recorded B-side they wrote together in the months following the completion of When You Walk a Long Distance You Are Tired. &quot;It Hurts Until It Doesn&#39;t,&quot; which looks at the dichotomy of an artist&#39;s ego and sense of self-doubt, falls somewhere in between &ndash; the first song she wrote that she saw in the context of something bigger than her performing solo, it takes many twists and turns before arriving, like so many of their songs, at a different sonic place than where it began.

Upon the album&#39;s completion in January 2015, the new quartet line-up steadily played local shows throughout the spring and summer, including at festivals like ATHfest and Slingshot. Before heading out on their first tour supporting Of Montreal, they debuted &quot;No Crying in Baseball,&quot; earning national press attention from Stereogum, NME, Brooklyn Vegan, Ghettoblaster, and others. A headlining east coast tour followed in September, and things began to fall into place. Stereogum named them a &#39;Band To Watch&#39; alongside a premiere of &quot;It Hurts Until It Doesn&#39;t&quot; ahead of their 10-shows-over-five-days jaunt at the 2015 CMJ Music Marathon, which included sets at the Aquarium Drunkard, Brooklyn Vegan and Culture Collide showcases. Both the song and the band earned even more praise throughout the week, including from Vulture, NME, BBC Radio 1, and The Wild Honey Pie, among many others. The following week they were named one of Stereogum&#39;s &#39;50 Best New Bands of 2015,&#39; and signed to Grand Jury in the US and Wichita Recordings in the UK.

                                        The classically trained pianist and guitarist (born Dan Griffin) has been riding a wave of success with his debut single &ldquo;Heading Home,&rdquo; which was released by Darkroom/Interscope Records in January. The track features Gryffin&#39;s live instrumentation, including&nbsp;piano and guitar, and clean production work that fuses&nbsp;Josef Salvat&#39;s anthemic vocals with a bouncy groove, dreamy atmospheres, and an evocative, nostalgic vibe. &ldquo;Heading Home&rdquo; hit No. 1 on Spotify&rsquo;s Global Viral 50 and U.S. Viral 50 charts at the end of January and has racked up more than four million plays on the service. 

After cultivating a catalog of chart-topping&nbsp;remixes (including Years&nbsp;&amp; Years&#39; &quot;Desire&quot; and Tove Lo&#39;s &quot;Talking Body&quot;) that have amassed over 100 million streams&nbsp;in the past year, Gryffin is set to&nbsp;further his already steep upward trajectory with outstanding original music. With &ldquo;Heading Home,&rdquo; and his making the leap to live performance, Gryffin ushers in a new era of his career as he continues to manifest his own&nbsp;melody-rich&nbsp;style of house music on more singles to come, while establishing himself as an original artist.

                                        Night Beats play pure psychedelic R&amp;B music that spikes the punch and drowns your third eye in sonic waves of colour. Theirs is a bastard blues, contorted and distorted into new shapes for 21st century wastoids &mdash; once tasted never forgotten. This is music to melt your sorry little minds.

Make no mistake: their new album Who Sold My Generation sounds like it has been created against a backdrop of burning Stars and Stripes flags and with the whiff of napalm hanging in the air &mdash; an alternative universe where &lsquo;Helter Skelter&rsquo; is the national anthem and Charlie Manson is still on the loose. Acid-test heaviness is Night Beats&rsquo; currency, but this is no out-right nostalgia trip either. Instead of Nixon and Vietnam, Night Beats have their own epoch of God and guns and bombs and drones to rail against&hellip;or flee from. Besides, bad vibrations, blues jams and id-shattering explorations are timeless pursuits &ndash; why shouldn&rsquo;t today&rsquo;s young generation be allowed to take a ride down the slippery spiral that sits within the centre of each of us?

On their third album &ndash; and first for Heavenly Recordings &mdash; Night Beats perhaps most recall their Texan forefathers and psyche-rock originators 13th Floor Elevators at their &lsquo;69 peak, just before The Man busted young Roky Erickson and dragged him to the psyche ward for barbaric doses of shock treatment. These boys represent the best of the Lone Star State&rsquo;s flipside &ndash; that vast dusty hinterland of the soul where it&rsquo;s easy to drift off the map and reinvent yourself as part of the long lineage of creative cowboys who prefer psychotropics to rodeo riding, guitars rather than firearms.

                                        It happened in Brooklyn. In 2011, the members of Highly Suspect arrived in the borough from their native Cape Cod, MA. The next four years became a whirlwind of sex, drugs, and more rock &#39;n&#39; roll than most people could ever handle. Then again, Johnny Stevens [vocals, guitar] and twin brothers Rich [bass, vocals] and Ryan Meyer [drums] aren&#39;t &quot;most people.&quot; Those chemically-soaked nights, hazier mornings, broken relationships, and cathartic realizations leave residue across Highly Suspect&#39;s full-length debut album, Mister Asylum [300 Entertainment], and it&#39;s inebriating in the best way possible.
The boys moved into a studio apartment with &quot;no electricity yet,&quot; getting a cheap rate as Rich promised to add an elevated loft with five bedrooms. He made good on his promise and even launched his own contracting company that would fuel the band&#39;s exploits for the foreseeable future. As they slowly but surely made a name for themselves locally, Johnny cataloged experiences in the moment, either putting pen to paper in his notebook or using his phone&#39;s memos.

&quot;This album is a collection of everything that happened from the time I moved to Brooklyn onward,&quot; says Johnny. &quot;I met Lydia the first week we were here. She was the only girl in the building. It was Lydia and her roommates and us. She kicked everything off for me. The album is a reflection of our experiences. Shit, New York is the dream. On Cape Cod, I&#39;d wake up at five in the morning, work out, surf, and smoke a ton of weed. In New York, you&#39;re staying up until five in the morning, and the weed is now cocaine. It&#39;s a nocturnal life and a totally different thing. I lived it pretty fucking hard and had to write about it.&quot;

Their D.I.Y. music video for the drowsy, dirty, and dirge-y blues rocker &quot;Bath Salts&quot;&mdash;which Johnny penned after &quot;overdosing on a huge combination of shit&quot;&mdash;drummed up a major buzz online and attracted the band&#39;s current management. They cut another independent EP with Gojira singer and guitarist Joseph Duplantier behind the board. Continuing to slug it out live, they eventually caught the attention of 300 Entertainment in 2014 who signed the trio as its flagship rock outfit.

Following the signing, Highly Suspect entered Studio G in Brooklyn with Hamilton and cut Mister Asylum to tape. They tapped into something real, rigid, and raw that instantly resonated. 

Upon release, the record debuted at #22 on the Billboard Top 200, selling over 9,100 copies and making it one of the &quot;top three biggest selling rock debuts by a new act in 2015.&quot; Rolling Stone,Entertainment Weekly, Billboard, The Fader, and more praised the group, and they shared stages with the likes of Faith No More, Jane&#39;s Addiction, Deftones, Eagles of Death Metal, My Morning Jacket, Grizzly Bear and more and lit up festivals such as Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo. 

The infectious grit and grime of songs like the single &quot;Lydia&quot; heralded the band&#39;s presence. Ryan and Rich lock into a creeping rhythmic stomp as Johnny&#39;s eternally haunted vocals transfix.

                                        Conceived at a drag show in Brooklyn in August 2014, Acid Dad has quickly become one of the most talked-about bands in the New York scene. Over the past year, their string of infectious psych-punk singles has earned them nods from the likes of Nylon, The Deli, CMJ, Village Voice, Impose, Hero Mag and more, and has garnered them slots on Gigawatts Festival and Color Me Bushwick. Dingus once described them as &quot;so fucking good,&quot; and if you listen to their latest single, &quot;Grim,&quot; you&#39;ll see why. Between dropping awesome tracks like that one, Acid Dad has made a name for themselves as one of the tightest and most energetic live bands in the Brooklyn scene. The band recently played 6 CMJ shows, including Austin Psych Fest&#39;s Levitation showcase at Rough Trade along with Drinks, Mild High Club and Shannon &amp; the Clams. Look out for their debut EP in early 2016.

                                        Escondido is Nashville, TN based artists Jessica Maros and Tyler James. Recorded live in a single day, their debut album, The Ghost of Escondido, was released to critical acclaim. Their David Lynch approved sound became the soundtrack to multiple films and TV shows including HBO&#39;s Girls and Sex Tape and led to performances on Conan and ABC&#39;s Nashville. Following tours with the likes of Lord Huron, Wild Cub, and Islands, the duo recently completed their follow-up album, Walking With A Stranger, due out early 2016.

                                        Growing up in Dublin, EDEN, never truly followed the typical music path. Classically trained from a young age, it wasn&#39;t until he began learning new instruments on his own that he discovered his passion for songwriting. Frustrated with the lack of creative control in band and orchestral groups, EDEN began to hone his talents at the age of 16. From the bedroom of his childhood home he began to cultivate a large online following, and establish in his own mind the vision for EDEN&#39;s future.

Today, the 19-year-old vocalist, producer, and multi-instrumentalist seeks to provide the world with an experience that is both uncompromising and authentic.

&quot;It goes beyond music really,&quot; EDEN explains. &quot;I want to give people something to hold onto.&quot;

Utilizing a &quot;less-is-more&quot; approach, EDEN emphasizes a blend of organic and synthesized instruments to create a unique and visceral sound. He seamlessly blends elements of influences that range from Queen and Skrillex to Kendrick Lamar and Hans Zimmer.

In August of 2015 EDEN released his debut EP: End Credits. The free release, which he wrote and produced entirely in his bedroom, has amassed over 14.5 million cumulative streams to date.

As a follow up to the success of End Credits, EDEN made one of his boldest moves yet: releasing his unique cover of Michael Jackson&#39;s &#39;Billie Jean&#39; in November 2015. The cover gained a million cumulative streams in just a week, hitting #1 on HypeM&#39;s popular chart and landing a spot in Spotify&#39;s New Music Friday, demonstrating EDEN&#39;s resonance with his ever-growing fanbase.

EDEN has since been writing and recording music at an astounding rate, as he prepares for 2016, which promises to be a breakout year for this extraordinary young talent.

                                        There is a contemporary sound occurring in the Bay Area and Guy Fox is one of those at the helm. It&rsquo;s not born out of decades of psych-rock, surf-rock or even folk, but lies at the very foundation of Bay Area music&mdash;soul and funk. Punctuating brass, playful bass lines, and even funk-pop make its way into a musical aesthetic found at the fingertips of Guy Fox.

Night Owl, the debut LP from Guy Fox, will street on August 21, 2015 following the release of two EPs (The Wild, 2013 and Guy Fox, 2012). Recorded over 18 months at San Francisco based recording studio Tiny Telephone (John Vanderslice), Night Owl embarks into evolutionary territory for the band. Staying true to their signature sound, this record is a listenable version of the energetic live set for which they&rsquo;ve become known. 

KQED Arts says, &quot;The group&#39;s sense of humor and lighthearted nature is matched by their dedication... They have a way of making any venue feel like someone&#39;s living room, everything else falls away until it becomes you, your friends, and a good old fashioned dance party fueled by live music. Effortless is the word I&#39;d use to describe their musical talent.&quot;

                                        &quot;Anthony Ferraro is a member of Chaz Bundick&rsquo;s Toro Y Moi touring band, but he also fronts his own project called Astronauts, etc. Today the band shares &ldquo;I Know,&rdquo; the first single from a fresh batch of recordings. Although Ferraro was at one point studying to become a classical musician at UC Berkeley &mdash; a career path derailed by arthritis &mdash; this track is a &rsquo;70s-style soft-rock gem that taps into some of the same lite-funk vibes as Toro&rsquo;s recent work while maintaining its own particular flavor. That makes sense considering Bundick is the one who introduced Ferraro into the popular music scene in the first place. The groove on this one is strong despite the overall pillowy quality of the music. &ldquo;Just hold me tight,&rdquo; Ferraro croons in falsetto before a smooth guitar solo enters to usher in the next verse.&quot; --Stereogum

                                        Lukas Graham, award-winning Danish artist poised for global crossover success, is marking his official U.S. debut with single &quot;7 Years.&quot; Hailing from Christiania, an autonomous, artistic community in the center of Copenhagen, Lukas Graham developed his natural talent for honest and gritty songwriting and quickly captivated the European audience, earning widespread overseas acclaim. Classically trained with the Copenhagen Boys&#39; Choir, with a musical scope widened by his Irish folk roots and passion for hip-hop, Lukas Graham possesses a distinct, poetic ability to capture the full range of emotions in his music. This is showcased perfectly on lead single &quot;7 Years,&quot; filled with Lukas&#39; impeccable lyricism and infectious hooks, and already making huge global waves: it&#39;s been streamed an incredible 100 million times worldwide since its release, is rapidly climbing the charts globally, and is propelling this Danish artist into the spotlight as more listeners connect with his soulful vocals and raw talent. Known for a phenomenal live show, Lukas has played countless sold out shows and festival main stage slots alongside his bandmates - Mark &quot;Lovestick&quot; Falgren (drums), Magn&uacute;s &quot;Magn&uacute;m&quot; Larsson (bass), and Kasper Daugaard (keyboard) - childhood friends who play an integral role in both the songwriting process and the live performance. &quot;7 Years&quot; sets the stage for the release of Lukas Graham&#39;s self-titled North American debut, which will arrive March 25, 2016.

                                        Fanfare Ciocarlia are a 24-legged brass beast whose eastern funk groove has torn up halls and festivals across the planet. Their energy and ingenuity having won them fans from Melbourne to Memphis, Tokyo to Toulouse. Having learnt their craft at the feet of their fathers and grandfathers Fanfare&#39;s members proudly approach every concert as a challenge to both entertain audiences and keep the true spirit of Gypsy music alive. Fanfare Ciocarlia went on to conquer the USA, Europe, Asia and Australia. The Gypsies may only have spoken their local Romany dialect but their music spoke an international language and audiences responded to their fierce Balkan funk by turning concerts into parties. What Fanfare Ciocarlia played was something new. The Times of London described it as &quot;a heavy, heavy monster sound&quot; and Fanfare&#39;s recordings have taken their eerie Balkan groove into dance clubs across the planet.

                                        Girlpool is a Los Angeles-based two-piece made up of Cleo Tucker and Harmony Tividad. Having met at local DIY venue the Smell, the two quickly grew very close. Their sound is comprised only of a guitar, bass and vocal harmonies. The band uses this bare bones instrumentation to accentuate their vulnerable yet powerful lyrics to create honest pieces, tackling concepts ranging from awareness and respect to the simple feeling of being alone at a show.

                                        British electronic rock band The Big Pink are making a welcomed return with their brand new single &ldquo;Hightimes&rdquo;. The single is a soaring maelstrom of powerful industrial beats and distorted chords, whirling in a heady swathe of synthesizers and stadium psychedelia, and serves as the perfect taster of their forthcoming &#39;Empire Underground&#39; EP and what&rsquo;s to come in 2016 .

With two critically acclaimed albums under their belt &ldquo;A Brief History of Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Future This&rdquo; &ndash; both reaching Top 10 status in the Billboard Heatseekers and Tastemakers Album Charts &ndash; The Big Pink will release the &#39;Empire Underground EP&#39; in early 2016 and will follow with their third full-length later in the year, alongside a North American tour.

Their forthcoming release features contributors Andrew Wyatt, Beth Ditto, Dave Mccraken (producer of Ian brown) and was mixed by the legendary Alan Moulder.

                                        The mythos of Sheer Mag begins like so many other celebrated rock &#39;n roll bands of yore: with two brothers. Following in the tradition of The Bee Gees, Oasis and The Allman Brothers, the brothers Seely conspired to create a rock &#39;n roll band to end all rock bands. The sheer magnitude of the endeavor required the recruitment of a daring drummer, a fearless lyricist and a diva who could party good AND write the rent check. With the pantheon assembled, MAG quickly recorded and released their debut 7&quot; to cosmic acclaim. The band now stands poised on the brink of world domination or complete destruction. Is it Punk? Is it Rock &#39;n Roll? We&#39;ll leave that to the music &quot;critics.&quot; But it is punk.

&#39;Fuck yuppies, fuck slumlords, fuck cops and the rich&mdash;make no mistake, this is the message Sheer Mag wants you to hear. It&#39;s coded into their lyrics and built into the young Philadelphia band&#39;s blown-out grooves, which match swaggering soul force with a defiant punk spirit. Sheer Mag might reference 1970s classic rock every time they holler and shred, but their gnarled, whiskey-fueled pop-in-miniature is of a singular breed: There aren&#39;t many contemporary bands you could imagine unironically covering &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; while some bloody-lipped fan stage-dives. Such is the essence of Sheer Mag&#39;s raw power.&#39; --Pitchfork

                                        With over 25 years worth of music to sift through, it may be hard to pick a favourite Sloan album. If, however, you&#39;re a massive fan of the Canadian pop rock project&#39;s 1996 LP, One Chord to Another, you&#39;re in for a treat. The band have just announced they&#39;re going to be playing the album in full on an upcoming 20th anniversary tour.

 Sloan will play two sets a night, with a full-album performance of One Chord to Another preceding a more general set of &quot;hits and fan favourites.&quot; The quartet had pulled off a similar feat in 2012 when they were touring behind an expanded box set release of their 1994 classic, Twice Removed.

The Toronto-based rock quartet is perhaps the most truly democratic group in the annals of pop, with Jay Ferguson, Chris Murphy, Patrick Pentland, and Andrew Scott all contributing original compositions to each record, equal partners with equal say over every aspect of their work. Where in the past creative lines have been blurred to create the multi-faceted Sloan sound, &quot;Commonwealth&quot; sees the four bandmates disassociating ever so slightly to create an old-school double album sequenced with each member staking out a single side as their own artistic dominion. 

Over the course of 10 albums and more than 30 singles -- not to mention multiple EPs, hits and rarities collections, live albums and official bootlegs released, like all the band&#39;s work, on their own independent label, Murderecords -- the band has tackled countless creative conceits while ever forwarding a sonic palette that blends pure pop and radio rock into what is now a truly trademark sound; all big melodies and power hooks, cheeky charm and tearjerking introspection, rich harmonies and idiosyncratic personality.

                                        The classically trained pianist and guitarist (born Dan Griffin) has been riding a wave of success with his debut single &ldquo;Heading Home,&rdquo; which was released by Darkroom/Interscope Records in January. The track features Gryffin&#39;s live instrumentation, including&nbsp;piano and guitar, and clean production work that fuses&nbsp;Josef Salvat&#39;s anthemic vocals with a bouncy groove, dreamy atmospheres, and an evocative, nostalgic vibe. &ldquo;Heading Home&rdquo; hit No. 1 on Spotify&rsquo;s Global Viral 50 and U.S. Viral 50 charts at the end of January and has racked up more than four million plays on the service. 

After cultivating a catalog of chart-topping&nbsp;remixes (including Years&nbsp;&amp; Years&#39; &quot;Desire&quot; and Tove Lo&#39;s &quot;Talking Body&quot;) that have amassed over 100 million streams&nbsp;in the past year, Gryffin is set to&nbsp;further his already steep upward trajectory with outstanding original music. With &ldquo;Heading Home,&rdquo; and his making the leap to live performance, Gryffin ushers in a new era of his career as he continues to manifest his own&nbsp;melody-rich&nbsp;style of house music on more singles to come, while establishing himself as an original artist.

                                        San Francisco-based trio The Old Folks make sultry music that fuses garage-rock, blues, folk and country.

Formed in 2014, The Old Folks features the talents of lead vocalist/guitarist Adam Spry, bassist Kyle Clouse, and drummer Scott Wright. They are currently recording their first full length album.

                                        The Coo Coo Birds are a San Francisco-based psychedelic rock band formed in 2012. Their sound is a propulsive, hypnotic mixture of psychedelia, blues, traditional Persian music, and raw rock&#39;n&#39;roll. They have released three albums, one of which was produced in Memphis by Adam Hill (who recorded The White Stripes Get Behind Me Satan) during the group&#39;s 2013 tour to SXSW. The group resides together in San Francisco in an old Convent turned artists&#39; collective, and their songs are featured in a Vice documentary focusing on their community.

                                        We&rsquo;ve been waiting for a while and finally it&rsquo;s here. Over the past two years Beach Slang have proved themselves as a band who can write memorable songs, share that energy live and create a community of like-minded fans but they&rsquo;ve always been missing one important element: An album. Luckily the band&rsquo;s full-length The Things We Do To Find People Who Feel Like Us is the culmination of their collective career and picks up where their two critically acclaimed 7-inches, 2014&rsquo;s Cheap Thrills On A Dead End Street and Who Would Ever Want Something So Broken? left off.

The feelings of youth and vulnerability lie at the core of Beach Slang&rsquo;s music, which is part punk, part pop and all catharsis. It references the ghosts of the Replacements but keeps one foot firmly rooted in the present. It&rsquo;s fun and it&rsquo;s serious. It&rsquo;s sad but it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s Beach Slang. This Philadelphia-based act have built their hype the old- fashioned way, without any gimmicks or marketing teams, which makes sense when you consider that frontman and writer James Alex cut his teeth in the celebrated pop-punk act Weston while drummer JP Flexner, bassist Ed McNulty and guitarist Ruben Gallego also played in buzzed about projects such as Ex-Friends, Nona and Glocca Morra respectively. However there&rsquo;s something indefinable about Beach Slang&rsquo;s music that evokes the spirit of punk and juxtaposes it into something that&rsquo;s as brutally honest as it is infectiously catchy.

                                        When it comes to studying the canon of rock and roll studio wizardry, John Pelant is a Ph.D. student. The myriad sonic details that separate merely good records from masterpieces &mdash; a specific Casio keyboard tone, a certain pitch on a drum-machine beat, the right amount of reverb &mdash; are the very particulars that Pelant revels in. He&rsquo;s scrutinized some of the greats: Brian Wilson, Paul McCartney, Todd Rundgren&hellip; And he&rsquo;s done his homework: when he talks about Lindsey Buckingham, he&rsquo;d rather discuss that magical, lost Buckingham/Nicks LP rather than dwell on obvious touchstones like Rumours or Tusk. And while he&rsquo;s more than happy to talk about Dylan&rsquo;s Blonde on Blonde, he&rsquo;ll end up parsing the best take of &ldquo;Leopard-Skin Pillbox Hat&rdquo; from that recent voluminous box set. Of course, all of this will be obvious once you hear the new Night Moves album, Pennied Days. Because the 26-year-old Pelant isn&rsquo;t just a student of studio-bound auteurs &mdash; he&rsquo;s well on his way to becoming one himself.

Formed in 2009 in the Twin Cities, Night Moves is composed at its core of Pelant and his 28-year-old partner in crime, Micky Alfano. Friends since high school, their bond was solidified when Alfano lent Pelant his copy of George Harrison&rsquo;s All Things Must Pass, a luminous classic of turn-the-page melancholy that echoes through Pennied Days. (Record geeks will recognize those glistening George Harrison guitar slides on stunning Pennied Days&rsquo;s highlights such as &ldquo;Hiding In The Melody&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leave Your Light On.&rdquo;) Over time, Pelant and Alfano have broadened their scope to allow for a wide array of maverick influences, ranging from traditionalist heroes like Leon Russell and The Band to r&rsquo;n&rsquo;b originators Curtis Mayfield and Sly Stone to pre-punk experimentalists Suicide. (They also love Joe Walsh, like all right-thinking Americans.)

                                        SALES is the collaboration between Orlando, FL mega buddies Lauren Morgan (guitar/vocals) and Jordan Shih (guitar/programming). Their sound has been described as indie rock or pop, depending on who you are talking to. They self-released their eponymous debut EP on September 22, 2014, and their singles (&quot;chinese new year&quot;, &quot;getting it on&quot;, &quot;renee&quot;, &quot;vow&quot;) have gained the attention of The Guardian, Stereogum, Bandcamp Weekly, Hype Machine + BBC 6, CMJ, and Gorilla vs. Bear, amongst others. The duo spent 2015 touring the US, Europe, and Canada. They are self-releasing their debut full length album, also self-titled, on April 20, 2016. Artwork for all of their releases is done by collage artist and designer Alana Questell.

                                        The debut full-length album from Vancouver&#39;s Bear Mountain, XO, is an exuberant whirlwind of an album that strikes a balance&nbsp;between long-form instrumental techno and soulful, vocal-driven dance club anthems. Centered around the duo of singer/songwriter Ian Bevis and guitarist Kyle Statham, Bear Mountain also includes Ian&#39;s twin brother, drummer Greg Bevis, and Creative Director Kenji Rodriguez. The band build its densely layered dance music by mixing live and sampled drums, &#39;80s-sounding keyboards, and Statham&#39;s arpeggiated, delay pedal-drenched guitar lines. Soaring on top of all of this is Ian&#39;s soulful tenor croon, often tackling the hook that, in a house track, would ordinarily be provided by a sample. This combination of electronic meets electric instrumentation gives Bear Mountain&#39;s largely dance-oriented music an organic, somewhat psychedelic, improvisational quality, as if they were playing and mixing the tracks live. Over half the songs on XO are instrumental; they&#39;re woozy, often dizzying, but each still has a melodic through-line to keep your attention, even amid disparate swirls of abstract sound. Bear Mountain&#39;s influences are definitely hard to pin down, spanning genres like R&amp;B, jazz, Latin, orchestral pop, dance-rock, and house. This cross-genre approach means that Bear Mountain fit just as nicely next to alternative soul acts like Under the Influence of Giants and Scissor Sisters as they do next to more cutting-edge artists like Cut Copy and Frankmusik. Tracks like &quot;Congo,&quot; &quot;Faded,&quot; and &quot;Sing&quot; are uplifting, infectious club-ready cuts that move both your soul and your feet.

The following two years proved to be a globe trotting adventure for the band; jet setting to cities like Bogota, London, Los Angeles, Paris, Stockholm, New York and Miami to perform with the likes of Jamiroquai, Foster The People, Chromeo, Tanlines, Bag Raiders, Sleigh Bells, and Dragonette.
In February of 2015, Young Empires released their first new song in two years, &quot;So Cruel.&quot; The song quickly earned rave reviews from the likes of Stereogum and The FADER, calling the track &quot;pure, smooth, electro-pop bliss.&quot; Young Empires are preparing the release of their highly anticipated full-length debut in the fall of 2015.

                                            <br/>
                                            
                                        The singer and songwriter Carah Faye&#39;s earliest musical memories include vocal lessons from one of The Chordettes&mdash;of &ldquo;Mr. Sandman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lollipop&rdquo; fame&mdash;and even performing for Ronald Reagan as part of a touring choir. Joining Shiny Toy Guns right out of high school, the California native would go on to receive a 2008 Grammy Award nomination in the category of &ldquo;Best Electronic/Dance Album&rdquo; for We Are Pilots and play over 1,000 shows as the band&rsquo;s frontwoman. With the group engaging a hiatus, she formally began pursuing her own path in 2013. 

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of Shiny Toy Guns, but it got to a point where I had to do this for me,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want anybody else in control of my career. I started making the music I wanted to make. I aimed to do for music what music did for me. I want to leave a lasting imprint that I can be proud of.&rdquo;

So, she holed up in an Upstate New York Cabin for nearly eight months, writing initial ideas for what would become her solo debut. Taking those sonic skeletons back to Los Angeles, Carah spent the next two years fashioning and fine-tuning her individual style.

Driven by robust production, resounding piano chords, and her dynamic delivery, the music definitely matches those three words and sonically nods to the likes of Imagine Dragons and Coldplay. At every turn, her voice immediately transfixes, matching that expansive aesthetic. That vision enchanted LAVA founder Jason Flom who personally signed her in the summer of 2015. 

In between creating her own music, Carah continues to expand her discography as a songwriter. She co-wrote the multi-platinum Zedd hit, &ldquo;Stay The Night&rdquo; [feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore], which earned her a 2015 BMI Pop Award.
Ultimately though, her solo music is exactly what she intended to do since day one. 

&ldquo;This is me unfiltered,&rdquo; she  proudly confesses. &ldquo;This is the most honest I&rsquo;ve ever been. This is my story. This is who I am. You&rsquo;re either going to love me or not, but I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s out there.&rdquo;

                                        For twenty years Diana Arbenina has been taking the stage to create her magic. Diana&#39;s songs not only inspire her audience to sing along with her, but also take her audience&#39;s breath away. Diana plays her music with such gentle sensitivity that both these reactions can be honestly drawn from her fans. She goes from deeply penetrating hits to daringly revealing acoustics and then suddenly turns to poetry, reciting what she calls &quot;anti songs&quot;. Without fail, the moments between the first notes of the first song and the cheers for encore are fleeting.

On December 10th and 11th in New York and San Francisco it will be the same, but&hellip; better. After 20 years of artistic life this event is not just a formal anniversary.

It is a unique celebration of Diana&#39;s accumulations of experiences throughout the years she has performed and her masterful ability to share them with her fans.

Immediately following her anniversary concert in Moscow, Diana will embark on a journey to the US visiting two distinct cities, New York-the sparkling, sleepless city of the East Coast- and San Fransisco, the flamboyant, colorful city of the West Coast. We are beginning the festivities soon &ndash; come join us!

All sales are Final. Tickets are very limited due to size of the venues. Early Bird Special - Valid though October 1, 2013.

                                        As of lately, Toronto has been the breeding grounds for some of the best punk rock bands around. The scene is both a blessing and a curse. There seem to be 1,000+ loud rock bands in this city vying for attention, but when you are able to cut through the static, everyone seems to take notice. This is the case for Toronto four-piece, PUP.

What sets PUP apart in this booming scene is their ability to fuse raw punk energy with catchy earworms, big hooks, and scream-along choruses. Their songs are loud and fast, equal parts unchecked energy and calculated arrangements, with hair-pin turns, raging guitar riffs, and an overload of gang vocals.

Live, the band brings it full-throttled, every single show. They&#39;ve gained a reputation for their sweaty, raucous, no-holds-barred live set. They play loud. Like really fucking loud. And every time they get on stage, you can be certain they&#39;re gonna play their guts out &ndash; house party, dive bar, festival stage, it doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s why AUX recently called them &quot;One of Toronto&#39;s best live bands&quot; and Grid T.O. named them their &quot;Ones To Watch&quot; for September.

In their short two years as a band, PUP has never stopped to catch their breath. It&#39;s been two years of tireless gigging, sleeping on couches, eating vegetable soup, nose-to-the-grindstone, eating/sleeping/breathing music. Two years of awesome tours, shitty tours, shows with Sloan, Titus Andronicus, Tokyo Police Club, Single Mothers, and a million shows with bands you&#39;ve never heard of and probably will never hear of.
