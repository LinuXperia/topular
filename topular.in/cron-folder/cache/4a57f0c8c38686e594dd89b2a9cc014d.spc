Picnics, road trips, beach excursions and ice cream stands beckon, leaving little room for long afternoons in front of the stove (though a warm oven is no plague during a San Francisco summer!).</p>
<p>Besides, at the height of the season, fresh produce is at its finest—best when left alone with only a splash of olive oil, a bit of cream or perhaps a dusting of flaky sea salt. And that’s what I recommend here, with just slightly more embellishment.</p>
<div id="attachment_6164" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/peach_galette.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6164" title="peach_galette_heather_hardison" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/peach_galette.jpg" alt="peach_galette_heather_hardison" width="500" height="202"></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><br>Illustrations by Heather Hardison</p></div>
<p>Prepare your favorite pie dough. Roll it into a circle and sprinkle it with ground almonds, leaving a 1½-inch border. Pile sliced peaches mixed with sugar on top. Dot with butter, then fold up the edges. Bake at 400° until the crust is golden and the fruit tender, about 50 minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/watermelon.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6140  alignnone" title="watermelon_heather_hardison" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/watermelon.jpg" alt="watermelon_heather_hardison" width="500" height="204"></a></p>
<p>Cut a small watermelon into rounds and remove the rind. Top each slice of watermelon with a drizzle of olive oil, crumbled feta cheese (choose a salty variety), fresh mint, flaky sea salt, freshly cracked pepper and a pinch of Aleppo pepper flakes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cherry_tomato1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6165" title="cherry_tomato_heather_hardison" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cherry_tomato1.jpg" alt="cherry_tomato_heather_hardison" width="500" height="223"></a></p>
<p>Toss whole cherry tomatoes with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a generous sprinkling of sugar and a pinch of salt. Roast at 400° for about 20 minutes. Toast sliced bread, then layer it with sheep’s milk ricotta and a big spoonful of tomatoes. Finish with torn basil and freshly cracked pepper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/corn.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6142  alignnone" title="sauteed_corn_heather_hardison" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/corn.jpg" alt="sauteed_corn_heather_hardison" width="500" height="198"></a></p>
<p>Melt butter in a skillet. Add chopped red onion and sauté until golden. Add minced jalapeño and corn kernels. Cook until the corn is tender, about 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Finish with chopped cilantro, lime juice and crumbled queso fresco.</p>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/little_gem_5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6162" title="little_gem_heather_hardison" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/little_gem_5.jpg" alt="little_gem_heather_hardison" width="508" height="284"></a></p>
<p>Make a vinaigrette with olive oil, champagne vinegar, honey, salt and pepper. Gently toss leaves of Little Gem lettuce with the vinaigrette. Pile the lettuce on a platter, then arrange halved fresh figs, blue cheese and chopped toasted hazelnuts over top.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/strawberries_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6170" title="strawberries_1" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/strawberries_11.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="247"></a></p>
<p>Slice strawberries, then mix with sugar and a splash of lemon or lime juice. Allow the berries to macerate for at least 30 minutes. Serve with a liberal dollop of lightly whipped cream, spoon over vanilla ice cream or stir into yogurt.</p>

<h3>For those readers following along, so far I’ve urged those who want to cook more, cook better or cook at all 1) to relax and 2) to practice. So now I’m going to assume you’ve gotten all chill about spending time in the kitchen and you’re willing to dive in and do things over and over again so that you develop muscle memory and they become easy. Now you need to start using your senses. All six of them.</h3>
<p>There are six senses when it comes to cooking, and to become a good cook you need to exercise most of them. To become a great cook you’re going to want to harness the power of the sextet.</p>

<p><strong>1. Sight</strong></p>
<p>“This one is good, too,” the art director said as he showed me yet another picture of stew that met his exacting aesthetic standards. “The chunks of carrot add some color.”</p>
<p>We were sitting in his office, the walls of which were festooned with the scores of magazine covers he had overseen. We were planning a January cover. It was to be stew. It was my job to provide them with the recipe. It was the art director’s job to provide them with a beautiful cover. A beautiful cover of a bowl of stew. This meeting was meant to help me know what a beautiful bowl of stew looked like. He had, quite helpfully, gathered scads of pictures of stew that met his approval in hopes that I, with my flavor-centric ways, could create something that wouldn’t make his job any harder than it already was.</p>
<p>An art director’s idea of a pretty stew, it ends up, isn’t that different from mine. The meat must be in largish pieces that are clearly meat in the photo, they must be well-browned so they don’t come across as grayish, there needs to be some other textural—and possibly tonal—contrast along with the meat, and a fresh garnish of herbs doesn’t hurt anything. Visual appeal and taste, mercifully, put us on the same page.</p>
<p>“Do you want something that looks like this one,” I asked, pointing at the chunky-carrot number, “but has maybe a garnish more like this one?” I picked up the photo of a darker stew topped with sour cream and cilantro.</p>
<p>“Can you do that?” he asked. His eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” I said. A recipe of beef stewed in ale with carrot and potato topped with blue cheese and green onions was born.</p>
<p>I used to stubbornly maintain that food didn’t need to look good, that only taste mattered. But that stew—delicious on its own but more interesting, more exciting, more flavorful with the garnishes that made it cover-worthy—points to a truth that I’ve since embraced: Prettying food up, when done judiciously, more often than not improves the flavor, too. Sure, grilled asparagus is delicious, but the contrast of a few gratings of lemon zest and shavings of Parmesan not only make it look better and more springlike, but also improve the flavor.</p>
<p>Sight is the first sense we use to judge food, it’s also the first sense we, as cooks, need to use in order to determine quality of ingredients. Look first. If an ingredient doesn’t look right, there is no need to smell or taste it next. Just move along.</p>
<p>An important caveat: Our sense of sight tends to be so powerful and we take the information it posits in our brains so seriously that its weight can incorrectly overpower other senses. Perfect-looking Red Delicious apples, after all, are famously not delicious. And art directors hate this simple fact, but it’s true that many of the most delicious, crave-able foods like stews and brownies are brown. Dull, un-photogenic brown.</p>

<p><strong>2. Smell</strong></p>
<p>For a few months many moons ago, I had a dreadful roommate whom I will call Finch. There was something a bit fishy about Finch. A bit lechy. A bit not on the up-and-up. He was a 40-something Canadian who lived in Paris and rented out the second bedroom of his small, wretched apartment, which, despite being on the sixth floor, always smelled of a basement. Finch supported himself by leading walking tours of Paris and getting a stream of short-lived girlfriends to cook him dinner.</p>
<p>One night the week before Christmas, Finch had a dinner party for eight, to which I was invited because, quite simply, the apartment was a bit too cramped to not invite one of its two inhabitants. There were raw oysters. Dozens and dozens of fresh from the market, just in from Brittany, kept on a bed of ice and seaweed—oysters Finch’s girlfriend-of-the-moment, Hélène, had bought. We ate and drank and talked and slurped for hours.</p>
<p>Late that night I woke up sick as a dog. For those who have suffered the indignities of food poisoning, you know what I mean. You know that moment when you realize that what was once a delectable meal is going to be coming out of you at both ends at the same time. You have to decide: How are you going to position yourself? For those who haven’t, you are truly blessed. Sometime mid-morning, Finch came home from his girlfriend’s place, took one look at me, and, to his credit, headed out for broth and crackers. An errand, it ends up, he had already run for his girlfriend, who was just as green as I was. He returned and his offer to make me tea sent me running into the bathroom yet again. I emerged on hands and knees and literally crawled into bed. Sometime that afternoon the phone calls started coming in. Everyone from the night before was in bed, unable to hold anything down, and miserable beyond belief.</p>
<p>Everyone, that is, except Finch. Finch, who just the night before had been everyone’s hero because he had so graciously and generously shucked all the oysters. “There were some,” he said, “that didn’t smell so good when I opened them.” He avoided those, he explained, but failed to warn the rest of us.</p>
<p>I moved out the first chance I got. And I always, absolutely always, smell oysters before I eat them. Smell ingredients, sniff as you cook, wait for the garlic to turn fragrant before you add the vegetables, know that you can smell when flour in a roux is cooked. Your nose knows, follow it.</p>
<div id="attachment_6131" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/touch_april_walters1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6131" title="touch_april_walters" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/touch_april_walters1.jpg" alt="touch_april_walters" width="500" height="485"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by April V. Walters</p></div>
<p><strong>3. Touch</strong></p>
<p>My parents were huddled around the cutting board, bent over and peering at the food on it.</p>
<p>“That one looks done,” my dad said.</p>
<p>“It still looks too red to me,” said my mom.</p>
<p>My dad had taken the beautiful rib-eye steaks off the grill, carried them into the galley kitchen at the cabin, and cut into one to see if they were done. Fair enough. It’s certainly how I had checked if meat was done. Until, that is, I learned that while poking was necessary, such deeper prodding was not.</p>
<p>The next weekend, when grilled steak was once again on the menu, I pounced.</p>
<p>“Dad,” I said, “let me show you something.”</p>
<p>Luckily, my dad is a curious fellow. He is not a know-it-all; he does not always know best. He’s a man confident enough in his own abilities and talents to learn from his children.</p>
<p>And the poking began. With clean hands and open minds, we poked at the steak. We started with the benchmark of raw. Raw meat is positively squishy. Super soft. Much like the space at the base of one’s thumb on an open, relaxed palm.</p>
<p>We sprinkled the steaks with sea salt and set them on a hot grill. We timed them for about five minutes on one side, at which point grill marks had formed and they released of their own accord from the grill (no, they didn’t flip themselves over, but when we went to pick them up with the tongs, they came willingly), flipped them over and waited another five minutes.</p>
<p>We poked them again. They had firmed up quite a bit, but still had some give. I showed him how to poke at the meat and compare it to that same spot on his hand as it firmed up as he held his thumb to his index finger (rare), middle finger (medium rare), ring finger (medium) and pinkie (you’ve overcooked it, in my humble estimation, but some people call that well done).</p>
<p>The poke-steak-compare-to-hand method isn’t foolproof, by any means, and the next time I went to the cabin I came with a thermometer in hand and showed him how to use that instead, but if you do it enough and get the hang of it, touching meat as it cooks gives you a fairly decent sense of where it is on the spectrum of rare-to-done. Especially if you poke it before cooking to remind yourself of just how soft raw meat feels.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to touch food. Use scrupulously clean hands, obviously, but freshly washed hands are, in my estimation, as hygienic and reasonable a thing to use to handle food as kitchen utensils sitting on a counter or clashing around in a drawers since the last time they were washed. Nothing handles the job of tossing delicate salads greens in a salad quite as well as human fingers.</p>
<div id="attachment_6132" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hearing_april_walters1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6132" title="hearing_april_walters" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hearing_april_walters1.jpg" alt="hearing_april_walters" width="500" height="583"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by April V.

<p><strong>4. Hearing</strong></p>
<p>When I was 17 I lived with a family in Dijon, France, for a semester as an exchange student. The grandmother was often there, helping take care of the house and family since both parents worked and the father had to travel a lot. One evening we were playing yet another game of cards with the other kids while she poured me yet another cup of chamomile tea in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms of whatever the damp winter air of Dijon seemed to have permanently trapped in my young lungs.</p>
<p>“Ah,” she said, seemingly out of nowhere, “the chicken, it sings.”</p>
<p>She got up from the dining table, walked into the kitchen, opened the oven, and pulled out a perfectly browned roasted chicken.</p>
<p>I filed that phrase away as a particularly lovely one. How French, I thought, to speak of a chicken singing when it was done cooking. Could it be related to the English phrase “it’s not over until the fat lady sings”? Were chickens thought to be particularly operatic in France?</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: I didn’t figure this out for at least 15 years, but when a chicken is well and fully roasted, is makes a hissing noise. To practiced cooks—especially to those who love chicken—that hissing does, indeed, sound like singing.</p>
<p>Listening is, by far, the most underrated and underused sense in terms of cooking. Yet what better way to tell a pan is hot enough than to hear the sizzle the steak makes the minute it touches the surface? Boiling water makes a noise you can hear from the other room if you’ve left the kitchen to check your email. Popping can be good or bad, depending on what you’re cooking, but it usually requires some level of attention.</p>
<div id="attachment_6133" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/taste_april_walters1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6133" title="taste_april_walters" src="http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/taste_april_walters1.jpg" alt="taste_april_walters" width="500" height="375"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by April V. Walters</p></div>
<p><strong>5. Taste</strong></p>
<p>Do we need to get into this one? Do you need to hear about the time my dining table was full and I tucked into that first bite of the asparagus soup I made all the time and realized I had forgotten to salt it because I hadn’t tasted it before serving it?</p>
<p>Taste is the sense food most obviously pleases and the one we usually most straightforwardly seek to satisfy when we cook.</p>
<p></p><hr><p><em>We need to use the sense of taste as we cook, not just call it forth at the end</em><br><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=We+need+to+use+the+sense+of+taste+as+we+cook%2C+not+just+call+it+forth+at+the+end&amp;url=http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/a-semi-autobiographical-guide-to-cooking-like-a-pro-part-3-senses/" target="_blank">Click To Tweet</a> - <a href="http://coschedule.com/?utm_source=http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com&amp;utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_term=Click+To+Tweet&amp;utm_content=http://www.ediblesanfrancisco.com/a-semi-autobiographical-guide-to-cooking-like-a-pro-part-3-senses/&amp;utm_campaign=coschedule" title="Content Marketing Editorial Calendar" target="_blank">Powered By CoSchedule</a></p><hr><p>Yet we need to use the sense of taste as we cook, not just call it forth at the end. It’s why lots of chefs are fat and even more chefs pay a great deal of attention to their weight in order to keep from becoming fat. Gordon Ramsay supposedly used to bring his running gear to the restaurant and literally run home after closing to stay fit. Chefs struggle with weight so much not because they are eating dinner in their restaurants every night, but because they’re tasting everything all the time. A spoonful of sauce here, a dollop of polenta there … the calories add up.</p>
<p>Luckily, for home cooks, the “everything” we need to taste is much more limited. But good cooks taste everything. They taste ingredients, they taste each dish along the way, they taste garnishes. The habit of tasting, tasting, tasting as you cook, not just when you have a finished dish, will teach you more about cooking than anything else. It will also keep you from shamefacedly urging your guests to please, seriously, add some salt to that soup.</p>
<p><strong>6. Common Sense</strong></p>
<p>“Well,” I heard my co-worker say, “you’ll want to put them in the freezer.”</p>
<p>A reader had called the fine magazine for which we worked and been patched through to the food department. She had a burning question: How do you freeze blueberries?</p>
<p>While I might answer with a teeny tiny bit more detail (freeze them in a single layer—a rimmed baking sheet works well—before transferring them to an airtight container), it’s true that to freeze almost anything you need to put it in the freezer, blueberries included.</p>
<p>Common sense will get you far in the kitchen. Some people may call it intuition, a gut sense of what to do, but when it comes to cooking that gut sense is almost always based on experience, from having seen pancakes before and knowing that the batter didn’t run off the griddle. Your life experience, having seen and smelt and felt and tasted lots and lots of food over the years, has a vital role to play. I don’t care what a recipe says; when things starts looking, smelling, tasting, feeling or sounding wrong, go by what you know, by empirical knowledge, to be true.</p>
<p>After all, common sense will tell you that if you want to freeze something, you’re going to want to go ahead and put it in the freezer.</p>

<h3>The Self-Made Cooks Who Helped Define the Bay Area’s Cuisine.</h3>
<p><strong>Pioneer: Joyce Goldstein </strong></p>
<p>Like most of San Francisco’s commercial streets, strolling a few blocks on Valencia will march you past an open-kitchen bakery, a single-batch chocolate shop, a menu from Ethiopia and then one from South India and then one from Guadalajara. With not a single dress code in sight.</p>
<p>What now seems commonplace is what we’ve come to define as California Cuisine: local, fresh and often made in front of the customer. California Cuisine is interactive and eclectic. It changes with the seasons. It pushes culinary comfort zones. And thanks to Joyce Goldstein, people will remember that it is a new concept of only 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Although best known for her Mediterranean restaurant Square One and over two dozen cookbooks, Goldstein recently became a food historian as well, authoring <em>Inside the California Food Revolution, </em>a text that provides context for terms like “organic,” “farm-to-table” and “casual food.” And gives credit to the people who changed our dining culture.</p>
<p>Like many of the pioneers profiled in her book, Goldstein’s own story began without any formal training, but with a lot of curiosity.</p>
<p>“I grew up with overcooked food,” she says, “but I ate out really well, so I knew it could be done.”</p>
<p>It was just a matter of figuring out how. And while studying at the Yale School of Art and Architecture, Goldstein made weekly treks to the Growers’ Market on Chapel Street, hauling carts of ingredients back home to experiment on friends, teachers and family.</p>
<p>She learned by tasting, reading and never shying away from something totally foreign.</p>
<p>“We were a generation of confident people,” she says of herself and her Revolution cohort. “We traveled and we were self-taught. We never thought we would fail. And it never dawned on us to not run our own business or open a restaurant.”</p>
<p>With that confidence, Goldstein’s New Haven dinner parties transformed into informal cooking classes. Which grew into the first San Francisco International Cooking School, one she ran for 18 years. And eventually, a three-year cheffing stint at Chez Panisse Café. Confidence also led Goldstein to open up her own restaurant, testing her abilities and her diners’ expectations.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Goldstein changed the menu every day, a novel and gutsy move. She put unheard-of items like romesco and chermoulah on the menu. And she put a lot of faith in her customers.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to scare people but I knew it was delicious. And there was a general collective high around food in the 1980s. People were open minded and it was a bad time to be a stick in the mud.”</p>
<p>Goldstein was also one of the first chefs to put an open kitchen in the dining room, an architectural shift that transformed the entire experience.</p>
<p>“Restaurants became more democratic,” she says. The home cook’s palate got “jazzed up.” And restaurants were no longer just fancy, quiet temples of cuisine, but “a whole spectrum of dining formats that welcomed multiple levels of dining experiences.”</p>
<p>While the major part of the food revolution is over, she’s proud that most Bay Area eaters today know ingredients have seasons and that, if they ever see asparagus on a menu in November, it is (as she puts it) bullshit. But she’s also aware that, because of a culture gap and supermarket plastic wrap, people still forget the origin and value of the food available to them.</p>
<p>“People throw out words like ‘local’ and ‘sustainable’ but don’t understand what they mean,” she explains.</p>
<p>“Everyone thinks food should be cheap, but where did we get that idea? And when people say ‘local’ and ‘sustainable,’ they don’t think about keeping a farmer in business. We are supporting a whole community of people. <em>That’s</em> sustainable.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Pioneer: Victoria Wise</strong></p>
<p>In 2007, three women chopped culinary stereotypes to bits and pieces. Tia Harrison, Melanie Eisemann and Angela Wilson opened Avedanos, the only all-female-run butcher shop in San Francisco, where they haul, clean and hacksaw whole animals into a variety of cuts for purchase.</p>
<p>And while the store carries on a long tradition of butchers occupying this Cortland Avenue storefront since 1901, the name belongs to Harrison’s grandmother, Flora, whose traditions and recipes inspire many of the prepared dishes.</p>
<p>But Avedano’s is not alone in giving the world of meat and cleavers a feminine touch. In California, there is Chef Duskie Estes of Sonoma County and Lindy and Grundy in LA. And, of course, Victoria Wise of Berkeley, who opened Pig-by-the-Tail in September 1973.</p>
<p>A petite woman with a bob cut, it is hard to imagine Wise hauling 40-pound boxes of pork butt, working 12-hour shifts and haggling for the best duck livers that Chinatown had to offer. But Wise did just that, opening her own American charcuterie without any formal training in business or the culinary arts; just enough confidence and passion to run it successfully for a dozen years.</p>
<p>Under the influence of an Armenian father and a mother from the American Southwest, Wise says she was hands-deep in homemade yogurt and pizza dough from early on. But she never thought of food as a career until, while at Berkeley, she overheard whisperings about a new restaurant looking for a cook. A rumor that led Wise to make one of the first dinners served at Chez Panisse: duck with olives.</p>
<p>“I never had a moment of thinking ‘What am I doing?’” she admits. “I had total confidence because I had huge amounts of food knowledge in me. And it only occurred to me some years later, man, I would sure like to know how the pros do this.”</p>
<p>With Jane Grigson and <em>French Pork Cookery</em> in hand, Wise tackled the art of charcuterie.</p>
<p>“I tried to sneak in a pâté wherever I could at Chez Panisse,” she says. And after one and a half years, she left to redefine the American deli.</p>
<p>“At a traditional French charcuterie you might find a pretty little salad or vegetable,” she says. “But it was always presented in an extravagant way. The notion of a big tray with salad that you could take home and eat was new.” Wise made everything in house, from the crépinettes to the piecrusts. And she took pleasure in offering customers products like caul fat and boudin noir sausages that they couldn’t get anywhere else.</p>
<p>“This was before anyone thought you should touch blood,” Wise explains, “let alone eat it. But I wanted to make it because no one made it.”</p>
<p>Wise eventually closed the doors of Pig-by-the-Tail in 1985 to take on another new career: food writing, authoring over 14 cookbooks, earning a James Beard Award nomination and recently reinventing her classic offerings in <em>Sausage: Recipes for Making and Cooking with Homemade Sausage, </em>bringing the art of charcuterie directly to the home.</p>
<p>As for Avedanos, Wise cannot wait to visit the Bernal Heights shop, but refuses to take credit for inspiring its establishment.</p>
<p>“It’s not my legacy,” she says. “That’s a little bit of hubris because women have been doing this for centuries and it’s not new at all.”</p>
<p>Much like her own parents, though, Wise can take credit for giving generations of home cooks, including her own lineage, the confidence to trust their inner chef.</p>
<p>“I spent Mother’s Day with my son and he prepared the most amazing ceviche,” she says, pausing to remember the taste. “But he didn’t make it from a recipe. He made it from his heart and his mind. Food just comes out of his pores.”</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Pioneer: Paul Johnson</strong></p>
<p>Paul Johnson’s motorcycle ran out of gas on Martin Luther King Avenue in Berkeley. An East Coast transplant on a cross-country trek, Johnson decided to camp for the night in a field next to what was then called In Seasons restaurant.</p>
<p>“I woke up in the morning and the guys were doing prep,” he says. “I wandered over. They asked if I needed a job and that’s how the whole thing started.”</p>
<p>That was 1977. And by “whole thing,” Johnson is referring to his over three decades as owner of the Monterey Fish Market, author of the award-winning <em>Fish Forever</em> and leader in the sustainable fishing movement.</p>
<p>But back to the beginning: While cooking at In Seasons Johnson found himself meeting Jerry Rosenfield at the back door every morning when he dropped off the day’s order of fish. Rosenfield had two accounts at that time: In Seasons and Chez Panisse. And after a little while, Rosenfield decided to hand the business over. To Johnson.</p>
<p>“He said he didn’t want do this anymore,” Johnson recalls, “so I took over and started going over to the wharf in the morning in my Lincoln Continental, taking orders for the two restaurants.”</p>
<p>Johnson quickly learned the skills of a fishmonger, becoming a savant of sorts.</p>
<p>“I just kind of took to it and it was easy for me,” he says. “I could simply look at the fish and know if it was fresh without having to touch it or look at the eyes.” His fish sixth sense attracted other customers, like Hayes Street Grill and BayWolf.</p>
<p>“People would say ‘If you’re doing fish for Alice, then you’re doing fish for me.’”</p>
<p>The freshness of his product made Johnson stand out; but more importantly, the way he worked the dock changed the way restaurants valued fish. He choose products from the smaller boats catching by hook rather than the ones with a cheaper price tag, simply because he found the quality to be preferable.</p>
<p>“We were really one of the first companies to put quality ahead of cost,” he says. “It’s what we call ‘sustainable fishing’ today. But we weren’t doing it for environmental reasons back then; we were doing it for taste.”</p>
<p>As a result, his clients learned to be flexible with their orders.</p>
<p>“Chez Panisse never got what they planned for,” he says. “Even if they wanted rockfish, I would get to the dock and pick what was best. Then I’d have to go back and explain the rockfish wasn’t looking good so it’s sea bass instead, and you either have to make soup with this or something different. Fish is the last source of wild protein we have, so it’s up to nature what you’re going to get.”</p>
<p>Although a brief period during the ’80s and ’90s led people to fly fish in from all over the world, Johnson says we’ve come full circle and people want what’s local and in season again. But he does warn that trendiness can, at times, outweigh truth.</p>
<p>“I was in a restaurant in Oakland and the special was local swordfish,” he says. “Well, I know it’s not happening. I see what’s coming in and it’s not swordfish. Someone’s making that up because they know what customers and chefs want.”</p>
<p>To avoid false advertisement (and “fishy” practices) requires making the fisherman a visible part of the commercial food chain. And thanks to Johnson, those responsible for the day’s catch often now get credit on the menu.</p>
<p>“We’ve given the fishermen recognition as well as responsibility for their product,” Johnson says. “And by instilling pride in them, they take extra care of the product instead of letting it flop around on the deck. Because in the end, it is reflective of who they are and the job they are doing.”</p>

<h3><strong>Can San Francisco Restaurants Pay Workers More &amp; Survive? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>In the third of our four-part series on the cost of food, we offer different perspectives on the minimum wage debate so readers can decide for themselves come voting day.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a numbers game. Waiter Michael Procopio, who lives off tips, doesn’t want to take a financial hit on that front. Line cook Raymundo Gutierrez can barely make ends meet working two restaurant jobs. Small business owner Karen Heisler can’t see how her café can absorb a massive hike in the minimum wage. Fine dining restaurant manager Robin Kirby thinks her large, busy establishment can weather a significant bump in labor costs. Meanwhile bar owner Thaddeus Vogler believes a pay increase for employees is the right thing to do, even while he’s worried about what it means for his bottom line.</p>
<p>Welcome to the minimum wage quagmire. Heating up in professional kitchens around San Francisco, this debate is also cooking in political circles and voters will get to stir things up at the ballot box come November.</p>
<p>This culinary capital, the most expensive city to live in in the country, has a reputation for progressive policies that have trickled down to restaurant workers. Food-service employees here get health insurance coverage, paid sick days and the highest minimum wage of any workers in the country currently in effect: $10.74 an hour and annually adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>Not too shabby, since at the federal level the minimum wage for tipped workers has been stalled at $2.13 an hour for 23 years. (The state rate moves from $8 to $9 July 1.) And given this city’s fine-dining pedigree and today’s tech-fueled affluence, waiters in high-end restaurants have been known to pull in more in tips than some top chefs or managers take home.</p>
<p>And yet, right now San Francisco is in the middle of an affordability meltdown for many residents. So even though Seattle beat us to the punch when its City Council voted to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour—effective next April and phased in over three to seven years, depending on the size of the business—it seems certain that a $15 minimum wage is coming to San Francisco too. It’s just a matter of when.</p>
<p>In June this year, Mayor Ed Lee and the Board of Supervisors introduced a proposed measure for the upcoming election that would boost San Francisco’s minimum wage to $15 per hour by July 1, 2018. Earlier in the year, a labor-backed proposal sought to raise the minimum wage for all workers to $15 by 2017 but labor has signed on to the new measure.</p>
<p>The current minimum rate is “a poverty-level wage that makes it impossible to afford housing in our high-cost region,” says SEIU Local 1021 vice president Larry Bradshaw. “San Francisco now has the fastest-rising rate of income inequality in the country.”</p>
<p>The mayor’s proposal was billed a “consensus” plan, though some might call it a compromise. And not all the stakeholders were happy with the outcome. Earlier this year, business interests circulated a letter that outlined a more gradual approach to a wage increase. This draft proposal, backed by industry groups such as the Golden Gate Restaurant Association and the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, sought to stave off the $15 pay rise until 2020. It also advocated for a controversial tipped worker carve out, essentially keeping tipped employees at the current wage rate structure outlined in an ordinance passed by voters back in 2003. Under that law, the minimum wage has risen from $8.50 an hour in 2004 to its current rate, $10.74, with yearly increases linked to the Consumer Price Index. Industry also lobbied for a total compensation calculation—credit for health care and sick leave—toward their minimum wage obligation. Those moves, which labor groups oppose, were an attempt by employers to control costs.</p>
<p>Restaurant owners have other cost concerns. They want to level the playing field between front-of-house workers such as servers, hosts and bussers, who can earn decent coin from gratuities, and back-of-the-house employees like line cooks, prep cooks and dishwashers, who often toil over a hot stove or sink without earning an extra dime from a public hungry to dine out.</p>

It’s more like 4%.”</p>
<p>Few argue in theory against workers earning more money in this expensive city. Stories abound about line cooks leaving town because they can’t afford to live here and dishwashers and prep cooks often commute long distances to work in this food mecca, or they hold down multiple jobs just to cover the rent. But San Francisco is getting prohibitively more pricey for all parties and some restaurant owners say that it may simply become untenable to keep their doors open, let alone pay higher wages. It’s not just loss of profits that keeps them up at night: They live in fear of going out of business altogether.</p>
<p>“This current challenge we face in the restaurant industry is unprecedented,” says Bruce Hill, executive chef and co-owner of Fog City, Bix and Zero Zero in San Francisco and Picco and Pizzeria Picco in Larkspur, who declined to state his income. “It is without doubt the biggest and scariest challenge I have seen.” The restaurateur, who has worked at some of the city’s top spots including Stars and Aqua, employs 50 to 65 staff members at each restaurant. “Now we are faced with a whole new set of labor cost issues to even stay viable. Price increases are inevitable. At what point do these measures render a restaurant unsustainable?”</p>

<h3><strong>Kokkari: A tale of three employees</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The waiter</strong></p>
<p>For 14 years, Michael Procopio has helped diners choose dishes and select wines as a waiter at Kokkari Estiatorio, a consistently bustling fine-dining restaurant in the Financial District. Kokkari prides itself on offering attentive service with distinction; Procopio embodies the notion of hospitality.</p>
<p>The upholstered chairs, linen tablecloths and polished wine glasses of this Greek restaurant with a solid rep mark it as decidedly old school. No Mason jars, mismatched seating or Edison light bulbs here.</p>
<p>Procopio is a professional server; it’s how he’s made a modest living for 23 years. He could earn more if he worked full time, but he’s chosen to tend to a food-writing career too; he’s likely the only waiter in town nominated twice for a James Beard Award for his amusing online musings at Food for the Thoughtless. He adores Kokkari.</p>
<p>“This is an incredible restaurant. We’re always busy and the management gives me the tools I need to succeed,” says the 44-year-old, who lives in a rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment in what he dubs a nebulous part of town. “We’re encouraged to be ourselves. I’m not an order taker; I get to play host and that’s really lovely.”</p>
<p>Procopio doesn’t own a car and has no expensive pastimes, he says, aside from gin. Since he cut back his hours to concentrate on writing, he no longer has the disposable income to travel. He’s not complaining; he’s made his choices and he’s fine with them. Still, there’s no 401(k) plan, no job security. Procopio says his biggest fear is that he may not be able to support himself one day as a writer and that the physical demands of waiting tables might become too much when he’s old.</p>
<p>But that’s not a concern now. During an interview, Procopio had to double check what the minimum wage actually amounts to in this city. He thinks of it as his tax-paying fund, he says, since he lives off his tips. Typically, his tips run 20% or higher, as one might expect at a restaurant that caters to the business and political set, along with other well-heeled locals and travelers. Kokkari is a diners’ choice winner on Open Table in three categories (overall, Mediterranean and most booked) and ranks #2 in the city’s restaurants on Trip Advisor.</p>
<p>From a dinner shift Procopio typically takes home $230 in tips; a shorter lunch shift nets him about $100 in gratuities; he works 28 hours a week at the restaurant and brings home approximately $700 in tips, on top of earning around $280 a week in minimum wage. Kokkari, like all restaurants, has a tip-sharing policy. Many diners may not realize that if they give Procopio a $50 tip on a $250 bill it’s not all his to keep.</p>
<p>Tip outs—what servers give to support staff—vary from restaurant to restaurant. Some places pool tips, others ensure that the kitchen staff receives a cut, though technically it’s illegal under California labor law to tip anyone not in the direct line of service. The idea of tipping out is to compensate the other, no-less-important members of the service team.</p>
<p>An average check for two at Kokkari is around $150, says the waiter, but for explanatory purposes Procopio uses a $1,000 group check to illustrate how tipping out works at Kokkari. “We have a heavy tip out at our restaurant,” he notes, “because we have a lot of support staff and that allows servers to spend more time at our tables, which is our goal.”</p>
<p>On a thousand dollar sale, Procopio would typically receive $200 in tips. He gives his support team a pre-determined percentage cut.</p>
<p>“Out of that $200, I’d give the bartender $13, $10 to the host and $10 to the food runner. The barista gets a $10 flat fee every shift and the stocker gets a $5 fee,” he explains. “Our agreement is to give our busser $30 out of that tip but I give mine $40 because he’s my closest ally and I couldn’t do my job well without him. That’s $88 out of $200 right there.”</p>
<p>As with most industry employees, Procopio eats a lot of meals at his place of work, a perk of the job, which cuts down on food costs—not an insignificant expense in San Francisco. On his days off his preference and his budget dictate home cooking with friends.</p>
<p>Like any worker worth his salt, this waiter is protective of his earnings. So he’s not down with a tipped employee carve out, as some owners are seeking. In fact, he’s adamantly opposed to a tip credit, currently in place in 43 states around the country. A tip credit (waiters would more likely think of it as a tip penalty) allows restaurant owners to count tips towards a servers’ minimum hourly base rate. It’s currently illegal in California but some restaurateurs would like to see it enacted here as a cost-control measure.</p>
<p>Procopio enjoys the camaraderie he shares with other employees. He’s not sure what his brethren on the line make, but he suspects it’s less than he earns. “Those guys work so hard. They are friendly, great coworkers,” he says of the kitchen crew. He senses it’s tough to get by.</p>
<p>“If I lost my apartment I couldn’t afford to stay in the city and I know a lot of these guys, many of whom are Central American and Mexican, commute a long way,” he says. “I don’t know how they do it.”</p>
<p><strong>The line cook</strong></p>
<p>Here’s one example of how they do it: Raymundo Gutierrez works alongside Procopio in the kitchen at Kokkari. He’s a line cook. The Mexican native, a United States citizen, can barely afford the $480 a month he contributes towards a one-bedroom apartment near Civic Center that he shares with his four brothers, according to a <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> story.</p>
<p>Gutierrez works seven days a week, including a second cooking job at another restaurant; both jobs pay above minimum wage. He’s supporting various family members and hopes to bring his wife and children to the U.S., according to the paper.</p>
<p>“I love what I do and where I work,” Gutierrez said through a translator for the article. “But [the workload] is heavy.”</p>
<p>Gutierrez believes he deserves a raise. “It’s not just about securing my future, but those of my co-workers and family,” he has said.</p>
<p>At Kokkari’s open kitchen diners can observe the line cooks, who pay close attention to preparing and plating food. On the floor bussers constantly scan the room, dressed in crisply ironed white shirts and ties, keeping tables fresh, cleared and cleaned. Few guests even notice these employees’ presence. Restaurant work is not for wusses. The hours are long, the work physically hard and the pay low. There are also cuts, burns and demanding diners to contend with. Still, for workers like Gutierrez with barriers to employment such as language, education and training, it’s one of the few industries hiring.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>To afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco, a worker must make $29.83 an hour, according to a March report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Gutierrez’ struggle to survive in this city is borne out by hard numbers. To afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco, a worker must make $29.83 an hour, according to a March report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Add a second bedroom and the household’s hourly wage demands climb to $37.62, the highest for any metropolitan region in the country.</p>
<p>Indeed, this city is increasingly a town of haves and have-nots: Based on May 2013 data, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in April that the average wage in San Francisco is $32.41 an hour, 45% higher than the U.S. mean. The stats also show that a San Francisco tech worker averages around $104,000, while dishwashers make about $22,000 and fast-food workers make about $25,000 a year.</p>
<p>Some contend that tipped restaurant workers in high-end establishments like Kokkari are not in dire need of a raise. But untipped workers such as Gutierrez or employees who make little or nothing in tips at quick-service places such as Starbucks or fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s are a different story. And, as Saru Jayaraman noted in her book <em>Behind the Kitchen Door,</em> most of these workers are women and people of color.</p>

<p><strong>The manager </strong></p>
<p>Kokkari manager Robin Kirby has been in the industry long enough to live through several economic booms and busts. For the most part, Kokkari has been able to insulate itself from financial downturns, or at least adapted to market dips and still made money. Kirby is reticent to talk specific figures but concedes that the commonly bandied-about profit margin for a healthy food business—in the 5% to 10% range—is realistic for most restaurants in today’s economy.</p>
<p>Kirby remembers the days when it was more than double that; financial upheavals and rising food and labor costs have taken their toll on the bottom line. Kirby prefers not to discuss her income either, but will say managers’ salaries in fine dining can start at $60,000 and run well into the low six figures. Many enjoy packages that include a wardrobe stipend, entertainment budget and car allowance. Yet it can be hard to lure senior waiters to the management side, says Kirby, because they make a tidy sum serving without the added headaches that come with such gigs.</p>
<p>As for kitchen labor costs, she confirms that line cooks are paid a competitive rate at her restaurant, which is typically in the $12–$15 range, more for senior, skilled cooks. “We value retaining our employees and treating them well,” says the Oakland resident, who has worked at the restaurant since it opened 16 years ago.</p>

Unlike other local upscale restaurants, such as The French Laundry or Chez Panisse, Kokkari, which can seat 180, has opted not to add a surcharge to the tab for its diners.</p>
<p>“We’ve chosen to find other ways to reduce costs, such as negotiating better deals with our vendors,” says Kirby. Looking ahead she says: “Because of our size and volume an increase in the minimum wage is something we can likely more easily absorb than a small business.”</p>
<p>Still, like anyone who enjoys the diversity of dining experiences in this town, Kirby is concerned for the industry as a whole. Smaller venues, she believes, will take a bigger hit if the minimum wage jumps to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>“I worry about how our unique, small, independent restaurants, a vital part of this city’s dining scene, can afford to do this.”</p>

<h3><strong>The small business owner</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to Karen Heisler’s world: This café owner is asking herself the same thing. She’s the co-owner of Mission Pie, a popular neighborhood hangout that prides itself on feeding people well and taking care of its staff of 20. Like many micro businesses, especially small food businesses, she is all about hard work and tight margins.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old San Francisco native lives above her business with her partner in pie and life, Krystin Rubin, a professional baker. Heisler bought the charming corner Victorian building at Mission and 25th Streets nine years ago; her goal was to create a place that offered thoughtfully selected food at affordable prices for a diverse customer base.</p>
<p>Her café, which seats 30, has a reputation for sourcing good grub from local farms, employing youth—and dishing up delicious savory and sweet pies.</p>
<p>In the seven-and-a-half years the café has been opened, close to 90% of the hires at Mission Pie have had no previous kitchen experience. Nearly all made the leap from their hiring wage, above minimum, to $15 or more over a two-year period, says Heisler.</p>
<p>But Heisler’s run the numbers. A $15 minimum wage would put Mission Pie in the hole financially for the first time in its history. The only way to recover that income loss, she says, is through increasing costs at the cash register or reducing staff expenses. “A $15 minimum wage means we will surrender the practice of hiring young, inexperienced people who we train,” she says. “We’ll be financially obliged to hire only experienced candidates.”</p>
<p>Heisler makes an important distinction between a minimum wage and a livable wage. “They have two different roles and purposes. The minimum wage exists as a critical first step on an earning ladder, a position where a person with little or no work experience can begin,” she says. “A living wage is something that a person should expect to earn with demonstrated skills and abilities.”</p>
<p>Heisler thinks a tip credit should be on the table. And, in fact, it is incorporated into the recently passed Seattle minimum wage measure, along with employer credit for monies spent on health care costs.</p>
<p>“The gross inequity that results from an absence of a tip credit is so distasteful to me … in a city that professes to be committed to economic justice,” she says, of the disparity between tipped front-of-house workers and non-tipped back-of-house staff. Heisler and other restaurant owners attempt to address that inequity by paying kitchen crew higher wages, currently in the $15 to $20 an hour range at Mission Pie.</p>
<p>“With a $15 minimum and no tip credit, we will need to pay $20 to $25 in the kitchen to maintain a sense of fairness in our house. These are starting wages, mind you. That’s a difference of $115,000 a year which we have to generate somehow.”</p>
<p>For Heisler, introducing a tip credit is not just a way to control costs. It’s a way to acknowledge industry employees who are often overlooked in a tipping culture.</p>
<p>“We are missing an opportunity to do something bold and brave on behalf of people who work in kitchens, washing dishes, doing all of the hard work without either human or monetary feedback from customers.”</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Even at Mission Pie, where we pride ourselves on talking with customers about everything that goes into our food, this is too complicated a topic to serve well at the register.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Given the likelihood of a hike to $15 an hour, Heisler says she’ll have to pass it on. “We run super lean as it is and so of course we will have to raise prices and we will communicate clearly to our customers why,” says the former federal government sustainable ag and pesticide policy wonk. She’s not relishing those discussions. “Even at Mission Pie, where we pride ourselves on talking with customers about everything that goes into our food, this is too complicated a topic to serve well at the register.” Heisler and partner Rubin earn between $50,000 and $60,00 each a year through salary and shareholder distributions, an amount comparable to their highest-paid staff.</p>
<p>Recent history could offer clues to what lies ahead. Has San Francisco’s higher minimum wage slowed the growth of restaurant openings? Certainly not in the Mission District. Has it led to industry job losses? Not according to UC Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.</p>
<p>In the recent book <em>When Mandates Work,</em> UCB researchers note that employment grew 17.7% among food-service workers in San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. Has a higher minimum wage had any measurable impact on the local restaurant industry during that time? Menu costs went up about 2.8% in that period.</p>
<p>“Every time one of these laws was debated some people said the policy would hurt the economy and kill jobs—and every time they were wrong,” says Miranda Dietz, a research data analyst at UC’s Center for Labor Research and Education and a co-editor of the book. “The sky-will-fall admonitions never materialized, as the laws did not hurt employment at all.”</p>
<p>Heisler is less optimistic about the future. If the minimum wage climbs quickly to $15 an hour, small businesses like Mission Pie will close or have to fundamentally transform. “This will happen not all at once, like an earthquake,” she says, “but over a few years, like cracks in the walls from many small shocks.”</p>

<h3><strong>The case for making more</strong></h3>
<p>Bar owner Thad Vogler feels Heisler’s pain. And fear. And yet he’s in favor, in principle, of upping the minimum wage to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s tenable to offer workers less than that and I question even whether that’s a sustainable amount to live on,” says Vogler, the owner of the 110-seat SoMa-based Bar Agricole, a James Beard Award winner.</p>
<p>He, too, is experiencing all the industry challenges that Heisler faces. Losing talented cooks to the less expensive East Bay. Paying well above minimum wage for valued workers. Dealing with inadequate public transportation that prevents restaurant workers easily and inexpensively commuting in the wee hours from work to home and vice versa. Trying to address the income inequities in his own bars. Vogler recently opened a second spot, Trou Normand, which seats 80, on Montgomery Street.</p>
<p>Owning a restaurant business isn’t for wusses either. It’s not surprising that this Yale graduate, who grew up in an academic family in Santa Cruz and has worked in Paris, Tokyo and Cuba, among other places, thinks that the U.S. model for paying workers is due for an overhaul. He also points out that industry trends—such as communal tables, counter service, mismatched dinnerware—have economic underpinnings. The days of old-style service and white tablecloths are on their way out, he says, because most business owners simply can’t justify such costs in the current climate. Fashion trends, he points out, always come from financial necessity.</p>
<p>Vogler sees the big picture beyond craft cocktails and small plates. “As a society, the middle class can’t afford servants; they’re not affluent enough for that, so restaurants fulfill some of that function: offering people the chance to be waited on even if only for a few hours,” he says. “In order to sustain that, there has to be a class of people who earn less. That’s the tension point. It’s an ideological one. I have no problem politically if we address that inequity but if that does go down it would mean a huge cultural shift.”</p>
<p>Don’t go hungry waiting. Vogler looks around his neighborhood and sees tech companies getting hefty tax breaks to do business in the city. Meanwhile, the culinary industry—one of the city’s largest employers providing a service that is synonymous with San Francisco—is left to fend for itself. He’s been in the bar business for around 26 years and says it’s getting harder and harder to stay afloat. Vogler has a mortgage on a house in the Mission; this year he’s paying himself a salary of $75,000 per bar. He says he lives in “constant terror” that he’s not going to be able to meet all his financial responsibilities, including to his 80 employees, whether from a downturn in business, a dip in the economy or rising wage costs. But almost three decades in the challenges haven’t dulled his delight in what he calls the art form of his industry.</p>
<p>Prior to opening his own bar in 2010, Vogler designed, opened and managed bars for almost 20 years at more than 10 top Bay Area venues including Jardiniere, Bourbon &amp; Branch, Beretta, Flora and Camino. Vogler recently hired a new chef at Bar Agricole, seasoned cook Melissa Reitz, who has come on as a partner. He takes a historic, long view on his industry.</p>
<p>Service is an iconic American concept, whose heyday might have peaked during the era of jazz supperclubs, he says. The culture of service is disappearing from the city’s landscape—white-tablecloth restaurants are shutting their doors or reinventing themselves. Case in point: After more than 40 years of business, San Francisco fine-dining institution Fleur de Lys served its final dinner in June.</p>
<p>Restaurateurs are business owners but industry insiders maintain they’re more than that.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Restaurateurs want to feed people, nourish their souls and provide gathering places for them to celebrate important events in their lives, they don’t go into the business to become experts on health care law or employees’ wages. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>“Restaurateurs want to feed people, nourish their souls and provide gathering places for them to celebrate important events in their lives,” says GGRA’s Borden. “They don’t go into the business to become experts on health care law or employees’ wages. And it’s not the typical us versus them that you might find in other industries,” adds the former IBM manager. “Their employees are like family; restaurant owners and chefs depend on their staff. They need their workers happy, healthy and executing their vision.”</p>
<p>Some wonder out loud whether getting rid of tipping altogether might be one solution to the problem. One restaurant owner, recently relocated from San Diego and about to open two places in Oakland, even tried it. For more than six years, Jay Porter adopted a strictly tip-less policy at his popular sustainable sausage joint The Linkery, adding an automatic 18% surcharge to dining-in checks instead. Porter says the move helped level the playing field among staff, created unity and improved business, service and the quality of food coming out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>And, here’s the kicker: His kitchen staff and his servers ended up making more money. On his eponymously named blog Porter took a deep dive into the benefits of a tip-free restaurant from personal experience; his multi-part treatise garnered national attention last year. Tipping is like high-fructose corn syrup, says Porter: Everyone gets this rush and thinks they’re getting a good deal out of it. But his experiment proved otherwise and research suggests that the practice promotes racial, age and gender-based discrimination against both employees and customers.</p>
<p>Porter’s convinced that a culture that values civil rights should make tipping not just optional but illegal. He just doesn’t think the burden to adopt such a policy should be forced on small business owners like himself. Porter is poised to open The Half Orange, a sausage, burger and beer joint, in Oakland’s Fruitvale District; a seafood-oriented restaurant, Salsipuedes, is slated to follow in a North Oakland neighborhood where dining out options are slim. Oakland voters will also have the opportunity to approve a raise for minimum wage workers come November. A ballot measure seeks an increase to $12.25 an hour in 2015, with annual increases pegged to the cost of living.</p>
<p>In fundamental ways, Porter, Vogler and Heisler are on the same page.</p>
<p>“The restaurant industry is hyper-competitive and runs on razor-thin margins, and customers choose restaurants largely based on perceived value, not on how much the restaurants pay their staff,” says Porter. “Individual restaurant owners don’t have a lot of leeway, if they pay their staff a lot more than their competitors then they have to raise prices above their competitors, and they’ll lose customers. That’s why if we want restaurant workers to be paid a fair wage, that has to come as a mandate from the government.”</p>
<p>But outlawing tipping in favor of a surcharge is not on the table this November. Food for thought for the future, perhaps. In the interim, will voters opt to increase workers’ wages this fall and how will the industry respond if they do? Stay tuned.</p>
