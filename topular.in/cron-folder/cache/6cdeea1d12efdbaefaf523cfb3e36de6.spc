The subtitle is the three facets of such an attack that Koppel investigates.</p>
<p>The section “A Cyberattack” takes a look at the ways the US could be targeted by enemies. For me, this was basically old news. The government doesn’t want to do anything because nothing’s happened yet. Companies aren’t convinced it’s a big enough threat to invest. While this chapter is important to establish context, if you follow this sort of thing even casually there’s nothing new here.</p>
<p>We move on to “A Nation Unprepared.” The shortest section of them all, this goes into what the government is prepared for. It leads well into “Surviving the Aftermath” which explores how the government would react, and how individual communities would react. Which sounds useful, but I find myself going “why do I care?” They’re looking at rural america as well as the Mormon community.</p>
<p>At first glance, <em>Lights Out</em> is a well written book for someone who isn’t aware of this particular threat. But, there’s some really concerning language in here about what the government should have control over. Koppel often touches on giving up privacy in exchange for more security throughout the book. He says “If we insist too adamantly on protecting privacy, we’ll sacrifice both free enterprise and security.” This tone throughout the book made me uncomfortable and a little angry. As such, I cannot in good faith recommend this to you.</p>

<p>By making cable companies conform to an open standard, anyone could make a set top box that could get cable. Better yet, you might not even need a set top box, and the functionality would be in your TV. Remember when you could just plug the cable straight into your TV and watch? We could be there again!</p>
<p>This is one of those things that is good for consumers. It adds competition to the marketplace, and gives you the option of picking the device that fits your use case best. The proposed rule as entered the public comment period, meaning if this is a thing you want now is the time to speak up. You can read the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0218/FCC-16-18A1.pdf" target="_blank">full proposed rule here</a> (PDF) and file your comment with the <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/upload/display" target="_blank">FCC here</a>.</p>

A night which wouldn&#8217;t be complete without dinner and a movie. What would Valentine&#8217;s be without its close relative the chick flick?</p>
<p>As we settled in to our (admittedly kick ass) reclining lounge chair at the theater, the Husband and I prepared for 2 hours of your typical girly movie formula: Girl cant get her life together, girls meets boy, girl and boy break up, girl&#8217;s friends convince her she&#8217;s better than him, girl finds herself, boy and girl reconcile. And for the first 20 minutes, I couldn&#8217;t tell if I was watching a real chick movie or an SNL spoof of a chick movie. As Alice (Dakota Johnson) prepares to graduate from college and move on to the real world, she splits with her boyfriend Josh (Nicholas Braun) in order to get the space to find herself. She moves to NYC to live with her sister Meg (Leslie Mann)-cue stereotypical taxi on the Brooklyn Bridge shot here- and meets up with party girl and single life lover Robin (rebel Wilson). Robin and Alice begin their single girl party life amid a host of other characters, male and female, all out to find themselves and figure out life in the big wide world.</p>
<p>Ultimately, How To Be Single had a much more female-positive tone than I expected going in. Rather than fall for the typical chick flick tropes, the movie surprised me at just about every turn. I can honestly say it&#8217;s the first time that Rebel Wilson didn&#8217;t make me want to hurl things at the screen. (And yes, I know that&#8217;s Pitch Perfect blasphemy.) From the well-rounded male characters to the honest portrayals of single and coupled life, How To Be Single was an enjoyable surprise, appropriate for Galentines and Valentines dates alike. See it in theaters February 12th.</p>

<p>I was born too late, and too in the middle of flyover country, to truly be a part of the Riot Grrl revolution. But when I (completely legally) found this music a decade after it was written, it didn&#8217;t matter. It finally felt like someone understood what it was like to be an angry girl.</p>
<p>Reading <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1WKVC48" target="_blank">Girls to the Front</a></em> in my late 20s shed a light on this movement and music that as a 15 year old I couldn&#8217;t have comprehended. It described the punk scene of the early 90s, and how much it wasn’t friendly to women. And what the women of these bands stood for as they carved a place out that was just for them.</p>
<p>One thing that really bugged me about this book was how dismissive they were about pop acts that embraced “girl power” in the mid-90s. They call out the Spice Girls as being a watered-down, commercial version of what they did. And maybe that’s true. But they’re ignoring how important that was to us young girls at the time. In 1996 I was too young to even really know what punk music was (which I thought was Green Day). But I listened to Spice non-stop (when I wasn’t listening to <em>Middle of Nowhere</em> that is). And seeing these women in every teen magazine spreading the message of girl power and friendship? Invaluable as a ten year old girl.</p>
<p><em>Girls To The Front</em> is a book for feminists and music fans. It’s also a great companion piece to the documentary about Kathleen Hanna, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Vlvcoi" target="_blank">The Punk Singer</a> </em>(which is also on Netflix). It has a strong political slant, but it’s impossible to separate the politics from the music in this genre.That being said, I do wish there was more discussion on the music itself instead of just the movement.</p>

When I first requested it, I was excited because it’s not everyday a book recommended to you by a friend ends up on an “available for review list.” (Aaron, <a href="https://www.puregeekery.net/2015/11/23/securing-your-internet-of-things/" target="_blank">who wrote about IoT security for us</a>, recommended it to me.) But between request and arrival I started reading A Game of Thrones and completely forgot about Countdown to Zero day until I was straightening my shelves a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I really should have started reading it sooner.</p>
<p><em>Countdown to Zero Day</em> is the story of Stuxnet, which is widely considered to be the first cyber-weapon. The book starts from the discovery of the virus, and the way the engineers deconstructed it piece by piece to discover it’s intent and creators. We follow the political climate Stuxnet was released into. And lastly, what the implications of this weapon are as the world moves forward.</p>
<p>Really, the topic should be a fairly dry read. But Zetter writes the story with the tone of a techno-thriller. The security professionals tracking down the code are presented as our heroes, the ones looking out for the average user. They unravel the tale told in code, and release the information into a world that just doesn’t seem to care. It wouldn’t be out of place on the fiction shelves, if every word of it weren’t true.</p>
<p>I recommend <em>Countdown to Zero Day</em> particularly to those interested in politics or technology. But really, the way Zeller has written this story makes it approachable even if you aren’t up on either topic.</p>

Maybe its because I buy in to the New Year bullshit or maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m cold and my insides are warm like a Tauntaun. I don&#8217;t think why is what matters- what matters is how. What matters is what I ask myself. What do I want to know from my last year? What do I want to learn? My knee-jerk reaction is to say goodbye 2015 with enthusiasm. 2015 was not my easiest year. Good and bad decisions were made. There were ups and downs, things I want to remember and moments that I would sooner forget. I have a tendency to be a bit more negative than most. I prefer to call it realistic, but my mom would disagree. (Hi Mom!)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s here that I want to begin my new year. From a more positive place. Not looking at 2015 as a year I&#8217;d rather forget, but as one that launched me forward in to a 2016 I never want to forget. My 30th year. The year I finally embrace me. The year where I finally take a deep breath and reawaken the self that I have buried for so long.</p>

<p>Oh, sure, a few of the Marvel-verse movies over the last 10 years were better (<em>Iron Man</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron</em>), but those Marvel movies didn’t have to follow up Christopher Nolan’s Batman in the same universe. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811583/?ref_=fn_al_nm_4" target="_blank">Snyder </a>did.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Millar" target="_blank">Mark Millar</a>, who, of all people, is entitled to voice an opinion about comic books and be heard, <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/mark-millar-how-man-steel-traumatised-create-huck/">wrote about his disappointment with <em>Man of Steel</em> for Games Radar last fall</a>. His criticism is of the bleak, ‘realistic’ post-Vietnam era Wolverines and Punishers; the archetypes that have evolved into Tony Stark’s PTSD and paranoia, Jessica Jones’ season-long examination of rape, Black Widow’s ‘graduation.’ He sees the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/">Golden Age of Comics</a>’ heroes as, among other things, devices of hope during the Great Depression and Second World War. He mourns that one of the last bastions of that age, Superman, has now fallen under the shadow of America’s lost wars, the security state and militarization of police forces, and terrorism. He was never Superboy; Jonathan and Martha hid him away while the NSA collected meta-data.</p>
<p>Objectively, Millar is correct: the idyllic farmboy who was the All-American Boy With God-Like Powers has taken a backseat.</p>
<div id="attachment_7835" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7835" src="https://dmqwb2vwym315.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Superman2261-300x254.jpg?5f03b9" alt="Some men, you just can't reach.

<p>Objectively, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Landis" target="_blank">Max Landis</a>, who loves Superman with a passion bordering upon creepy, <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Chronicle-Screenwriter-Max-Landis-Tears-Man-Steel-38196.html">is correct</a> when he “believes Superman should have killed Zod, and he should have done it right away, saving the aforementioned hundreds of thousands of victims that were ultimately slaughtered in their punching fest showdown. ‘Because he&#8217;s not responsible for Zod,’ Landis explains. They should have fought in space or on the moon, away from the helpless people of Earth Superman has chosen to protect…” (To the people who say that Superman doesn’t kill: <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Superman_Vol_2_22">you’re</a> objectively wrong; sit down and let the adults talk.)</p>
<p>Objectively, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/man-of-steel-destruction-death-analysis">BuzzFeed and Watson Technical Consulting</a> were correct when they crunched the numbers on the damage to Metropolis and its economic impact to the tune of $17 trillion. (Global economic output in 2012 was estimated at $85 trillion, but we’ll return to the global aspect later).</p>
<p><strong>Adapt or Die</strong></p>
<p>What they’re missing, what is <em>necessary</em> here, is that in order for Superman to function in a universe with a Batman who PATRIOT Acts the entire city of Gotham, where terrorism and mass shootings and rising sea levels are real, he <em>had</em> to be dirtied up. The character doesn’t work when he’s frozen in time in an idealized America. (I say idealized because, contrary to the 24 hour news cycle’s insistence, crime against the person is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html?platform=hootsuite">at its lowest point in human history</a>). If you tried to preserve Superman as Millar would like and Landis fanatically demands, you end up with <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Kingdom-Come-New-Mark-Waid-ebook/dp/B0064W64XU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452012895&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kingdom+come">Alex Ross’s Superman</a> from the fantastic <em>Kingdom Come</em> – a super hero who was unable to save Lois when the Joker came to town, a demi-god who retreated to his Fortress of Solitude because he couldn’t change with the world; a man whose rage almost broke the world when he returned.</p>
<p>Then there’s the upcoming <em>Dawn of Justice</em>. We have Nolan’s Batman, which completely and <em>finally</em> divorced the Dark Knight from the campy 1960’s TV show. Batman is as he should be – he rules by fear, believes that people are fundamentally bad, and as the CEO of a multi-billion dollar corporation, is totally self-assured that his solutions are the right solutions. He is also battered from his years of being the Batman. This is who Affleck’s Batman is, and the arrival of Kryptonian aliens who level a nearby city is going to put Wayne on DefCon 5. In order to have that situation, in order to have Superman be someone that the Batman views as a serious threat to Earth, just as Batman needed to be separated from Adam West (and Joel Burn-In-Hell Schumacher) Superman needed to be split from the Golden Age, golly gee, and yes, Richard Donner. He <em>needs</em> to be somewhat terrifying – it emphasizes what Landis laments as if it&#8217;s lost: “instead of absolute power corrupting absolutely, it has absolved him from fear, and greed, and hate, and all of the weaknesses that stem from human insecurity.” &#8220;<em>Look what I could do if I really wanted to but choose not to even though none of you could stop me,&#8221; </em>is the cynic&#8217;s version.</p>
<div id="attachment_7841" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-7841" src="https://dmqwb2vwym315.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/the-batknights.jpg?5f03b9" alt="&quot;Batman?

<p>The Golden Age Superman doesn’t work as a character anymore and Snyder (and producer Christopher Nolan) recognized that. However, they didn’t destroy the character in doing so; rather, I would argue that they used a light touch to weave in aspects of the most archetypal Superman, Grant Morrison’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Star_Superman">All Star Superman</a></em> while emphasizing the fact that Kal El has always known he was <em>apart</em> even while being taught to love his adopted planet and its people.</p>
<p><strong>With Great Power Comes Boring Characters</strong></p>
<p>While Jonathan Kent, in a desire to keep his son safe, exacerbates the sense of isolation Clark feels, the fear he communicates to his son, the seriousness with which he imparts a “showing what you can do is <em>dangerous</em>” to Clark, Snyder gives Superman something we rarely see without the wand-waving of kryptonite – he shows the Man of Steel as vulnerable. His skin may not be able to be pierced, but we see him struggle with rescuing Pete Ross when their school bus goes in the river; we see him humiliated by high school bullies; we see him humiliated again in a bar (and his subsequent rage taken out on the bully’s tractor-trailer, which is something we know he <em>must</em> feel; if he doesn’t, he’s Brian Grazer&#8217;s automaton from <em>Superman Returns</em>).</p>
<p>Finally, we see him in his battles with fellow Kryptonians being beaten again and again, destroying the world he has come to love, because this is the first time his strength doesn’t automatically save the day. If his vulnerability and humiliation aren&#8217;t made a front-and-center issue, he is neither human nor interesting. He&#8217;s Dr. Manhattan with pants. (As an aside: I don’t give a shit how much damage was done and how many people died in Metropolis: Zod was going to wipe the planet <u>clean</u>. Smash up Gotham while you’re at it if you need to).</p>
<p>To Landis’ point about the destruction and death that occurred during Superman’s battle with Zod and Co., and to Millar’s complaint about superhero films constantly re-enacting 9/11 and to BuzzFeed’s calculation of the damage to Metropolis as all being out of character for the Last Son of Krypton, for making the last man standing amongst rubble into a rock star rather than removing the conflict Somewhere Away:</p>
<p>I would look back to that symbol of hope that Superman is supposed to represent (and that Jor El tells us is the meaning of the House of El’s glyph).</p>
<p>I would say that the message conveyed from the artistic destruction and imagery of towers falling, smoke rising, and glass everywhere with Superman still standing is <em>still</em> one of hope – we’ve been through the crucible; we rebuild. If that’s not hope, if that’s not the essence of Superman preserved, I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>With the whole Holly Jones/Killroys story still unfolding over public media and right here in Indianapolis, I figured this is a prime time to review a book I read a few months back called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed/dp/1594487138/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452036068&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=so+you%27ve+been+publicly+shamed" target="_blank">So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed</a></em>.  The author, Jon Ronson was motivated to research the topic and write this book when he became the victim of a public shaming that he did nothing to deserve.  Some university students created a spambot/AI that they chose to take on the identity of Ronson.  It created public media profiles using his name and picture, and started tweeting things that did not represent the thoughts of the real Jon Ronson.</p>
<p>As he fought his own battle with public shaming that this spambot was bringing onto him, he started to get interested in others who had gone through the same thing.  Ronson tracks down and interviews a handful of people that have been publicly shamed to do the one thing no one ever really thinks to do.  He wanted to know what life was like in the aftermath of an event like this.</p>
<p>Without going into spoilers, it&#8217;s almost never pretty.  In most cases, the punishment does not fit the &#8220;crime&#8221; for these people, and is extremely harsher than it should be.  Ronson looks at history and science to find that public shaming was deemed so harsh in the 18th and 19th centuries, that the practice was abandoned.</p>
<p>Social media has brought the practice back, and along with it, the absolute worst in humanity.  Current public shaming has such a far reach that it destroys people&#8217;s lives.  For making an insensitive comment on Twitter, or leaving a self-centered review on Facebook in the case of Holly Jones, life will never be the same for people in these situations.  If you really think about it, that&#8217;s not right.  Yes, these people deserve a bit of humbling, but not from a world-wide mob.  That&#8217;s simply too much for what they have done.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed/dp/1594487138/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452036068&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=so+you%27ve+been+publicly+shamed" target="_blank">So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed</a></em> opened my eyes to this reality.  I have jumped on bandwagons before, joining an online mob to give someone I&#8217;ve never met a piece of my mind.  I try to think twice about it now, realizing that one harsh action does not deserve another.  I caught myself re-posting the story about Holly Jones, and felt a bit embarrassed about it.  I highly recommend giving this book a read.  I didn&#8217;t get what I expected out of it, but I think it opened my eyes to some much important things instead.</p>

<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1YJhCRw" target="_blank">Old Man’s War</a> &#8211; I have a confession. I’m over dystopian science fiction. We’ve had so much of it in popular culture that I’m bored of it. There are exceptions to this of course (see Cinder below), but I want a return to traditional science fiction. And that’s exactly what Old Man’s War is. It’s a military science fiction that has a very human story to it that you can’t help but feel drawn into. It’s the first in a series that I’m looking forward to reading more of.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1YJhzoU" target="_blank">Cinder</a> &#8211; And the rest of the Lunar Chronicles. This series was recommended to me early this year by <a href="http://ilayreading.com/" target="_blank">Haley over at I Lay Reading</a>. At first, I was skeptical. The last thing I wanted was another dystopian young adult novel with a female protagonist. But then I heard “cyborg” and decided to give it a try. And I’m glad I did. The series is a retelling of classic fairy tales with a cyberpunk twist. They feel fresh and new and I am completely hooked.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1OpeO0M" target="_blank">The Water Knife</a> &#8211; I loved this book, but felt like I needed a gram of Soma to get through it. A near-future post-cyberpunk tale of what happens when drought hits and water is no longer pumped into the southwest. This could be the on the ground story of how Water and Power rise up in the years before Tank Girl. It’s dark and powerful and something you should put on your to-read list.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1OpeTS5" target="_blank">The Martian</a> &#8211; More hard science fiction! When I read the reviews of The Martian, I was afraid it was going to be a very dry and technical book. Technical? Yes. Dry? Hardly. Weir does a great job of weaving a very human tale with scientific facts that is incredibly engaging. (<a href="https://www.puregeekery.net/2015/09/04/book-review-the-martian/" target="_blank">I did a full review on the Martian here.</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1YJhZM5" target="_blank">Game of Thrones</a> &#8211; I’m not really a fan of high fantasy. I’m not sure why, but it’s never really grabbed me. I haven’t even read Lord of the Rings (I tried, I just couldn’t get into it). But after hearing so many people say so many good things about this series, I gave it a try. And I’m hooked just like everyone else. I will recommend you read this book digitally if possible. There are so many characters and relationships that Kindle X-Ray made it much easier to keep up with who is who in the beginning.</li>

I personally loved this approach because it gave me more time to work on my project and get help specific to what I was working on, which was particularly great for me because I took on a project a bit beyond my skills&#8230;.nesting end tables.</p>
<p>I chose the tables from <a href="http://amzn.to/1YJpjqZ" target="_blank">Mid-Century Modern Furniture: Shop Drawings &amp; Techniques for Making 29 Projects by Michael Crow</a> thinking they didn&#8217;t look too complicated. But as is often the case with these things, they were more complicated that I had originally thought. I had to consider grain matching, how to layout cuts, and make sure the grain was consistent between tables. Things I hadn&#8217;t had to consider when I was working with a single board. I also learned how to make templates, and how to use a router and biscuit joiner.</p>
<p>Throughout the 16-week course I had to miss a few sessions, which put me short on time. My husband actually ended up doing the final assembly of putting the legs onto the tabletop with dowels. I&#8217;m incredibly happy with the end product, and yes this post is basically a not-so-humble brag.</p>

<p>For those interested, the tables are built out of cherry, finished with Danish Oil in natural and rub-on poly in satin.</p>
