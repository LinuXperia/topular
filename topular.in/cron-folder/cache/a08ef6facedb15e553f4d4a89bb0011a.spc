<p align="left">The people were heard. A besieged Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired Police Chief Garry McCarthy. He was under pressure from all quarters – protestors, the business community, ministers, fellow politicians, the media, but most of all the people. There are many lessons to be learned here.</p>
<p align="left">The mayor supported McCarthy until he couldn’t. Public pressure was too much. The mayor succumbs to pressure; we have seen it for the second time. The first was the April runoff for the mayor’s election. Trying to get the vote, Rahm said he would change, he would listen more. Really.</p>
<p align="left">The protest march on Black Friday along the Magnificent Mile was effective. The stores were negatively impacted, reportedly losing 25 to 50 percent of revenue on the first day of the holiday shopping season. I am sure the business community’s calls to City Hall were well heard.</p>
<p align="left">McCarthy is a sacrificial lamb, though his resignation is not unwarranted.</p>
<p align="left">The crowd has been calling for the resignation of Anita Alvarez, the firing of McCarthy, and the impeachment or resignation of the mayor. The marching was successful. The protesters have won a round.</p>
<p align="left">They will win another one when Alvarez leaves office shortly, either through her own resignation or from losing her bid for re-election as Cook County State’s Attorney in March of 2016.</p>

<p align="left">McCarty is a cop’s cop; obviously not the people’s cop, but a cop’s cop. He supported his men in blue even in the face of obvious wrongdoing. He lied in a press release on the killing of Laquan McDonald, saying that the young African-American male teenager had a knife and was lunging toward the policeman, Jason Van Dyke, when the video shows differently.</p>
<p align="left">Cold-blooded murder was on the tape, without any shadow of a doubt. McCarthy acknowledged that he had seen the video the day after the incident in October of 2014, and yet he supported his officer and simply reduced him to a desk job with full pay. Van Dyke should have been dismissed and indicted for murder the same day McCarthy saw the tape. McCarthy was blind.</p>
<p align="left">The mayor waited too long. A year – 13 months, actually, is too long. He should have used his heavy hand, his clout, to investigate. The case of McDonald was fumbled. The mayor awarded the family $5 million and got the City Council to vote with him to do it and none, so they say, have seen the tape. Is the public stupid?</p>
<p align="left">The mayor should have looked at the tape to help his decision-making, but he said he didn’t watch it. Maybe the mayor acted in his own best interest to win the election with what appears to be a cover-up.</p>

<p align="left">Emanuel hired a cop to the top position of the Chicago Police Department whose people skills are lacking. His talk was constantly about what they did in New York. It seemed that sometimes he forgot he was in Chicago. He was destined for failure, as he did not return the calls of aldermen who were trying to work with him. This was fatal and disrespectful.</p>
<p align="left">The mayor needs to regroup. His arrogance is troubling, but he looked very humbled and defensive in his press conference announcing McCarthy’s firing. I hope the McCarthy lesson will help Rahm to see the error of his ways. He is listening to the wrong people, but mostly he is not listening at all.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>FLASHBACK:</strong>Hanrahan And Fred Hampton Revisited
Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez waited 400 days to make the charge against Van Dyke. She says she was waiting for the FBI to finish its investigation.</p>
<p align="left">Anyone looking at the video could have made the first-degree murder charge against Van Dyke within 48 hours. Alvarez didn’t; she called the investigation “complex.” Clearly and without doubt there was a cover-up.</p>
<p align="left">The protesters are asking for Alvarez to resign for what amounts to either incompetence or ineptness. Whether she resigns or not, she will probably be trounced out of office by the voters in her bid for re-election on March 15, 2016.</p>
<p align="left">This is politically reminiscent of the career of promising Cook County State’s Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan when his officers killed two leaders of the Illinois Black Panther Party – Fred Hampton and Mark Clark – in a hail of gunfire during a pre-dawn raid on their apartment on December 4, 1969.</p>
<p align="left">Before that night, Hanrahan had been touted as a future mayor of Chicago or governor of Illinois, but afterward, a firestorm of controversy and years of court hearings followed, and Hanrahan was defeated in 1972 by a Republican in his bid for re-election as the county's top prosecutor. He faded into obscurity afterwards. Now Alvarez finds herself in the same position.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Flashback</strong> to when African Americans refused to ride city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest segregated seating. That boycott took place from December 5, 1955, to December 20, 1956, and is regarded as the first large-scale demonstration against segregation in the United States.</p>
<p align="left">On December 1, 1955, four days before the boycott began, Rosa Parks, an African-American woman, refused to yield her seat to a White man on a Montgomery bus. She was arrested and fined.</p>
<p align="left">The boycott of public buses by Blacks in Montgomery began on the day of Parks’ court hearing and lasted 381 days. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system. One of the local leaders of the boycott, a young pastor named Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a prominent national leader of the entire American civil rights movement in the wake of the action. Rosa Park sparked a new movement. The economic boycott buried Jim Crow.</p>
<p align="left">The Magnificent Mile Black Friday Protest March hit Chicago in the pocketbook. It will get the attention of the Fathers of the City. Change is in the air. The body politic is challenged. Black people are under attack. Racism is challenged. Change is in the air. And the protests will continue.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Flashback</strong> to when African Americans refused to ride city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest segregated seating. That boycott took place from December 5, 1955, to December 20, 1956, and is regarded as the first large-scale demonstration against segregation in the United States.</p>
<p align="left">On December 1, 1955, four days before the boycott began, Rosa Parks, an African-American woman, refused to yield her seat to a White man on a Montgomery bus. She was arrested and fined.</p>
<p align="left">The boycott of public buses by Blacks in Montgomery began on the day of Parks’ court hearing and lasted 381 days. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system. One of the local leaders of the boycott, a young pastor named Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a prominent national leader of the entire American civil rights movement in the wake of the action. Rosa Park sparked a new movement. The economic boycott buried Jim Crow.</p>
<p align="left">The Magnificent Mile Black Friday Protest March hit Chicago in the pocketbook. It will get the attention of the Fathers of the City. Change is in the air. The body politic is challenged. Black people are under attack. Racism is challenged. Change is in the air. And the protests will continue.</p>

<p align="left">I wish I knew one word to describe <strong>Spike Lee’s</strong> new movie Chi-Raq, but I don’t. It is a little documentary, as it opens with statistics of the killings in Chicago outnumbering those of the real wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p align="left">It is a lot of reality show. It is social/political satire. It is stereotypical and it is the new real. It is hip hop. It offends and fully displays a youth culture that suffers from violent lifestyles that include young men living with gunshot wounds that have left them paralyzed in wheel chairs or in caskets.</p>
<p align="left">The star of the movie is sex. It is raw. Spike takes sex and makes it a weapon. The gangbangers are fighting. They are killing the children on the South Side of Chicago, for no apparent reason. Many of the children seen on the protest signs are children who have really been murdered in the streets and their suffering mothers. There is one scene where <strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong> plays a mother who has lost her 10-year-old little girl, and she is scrubbing her daughter’s blood off the sidewalk. It is a real scene.</p>

<p align="left">Chi-Raq’s girlfriend, <strong>Teyonah Parris</strong>from the movie <strong>Dear White People,</strong> plays Lysistrata, named after the Greek heroine on which this movie is based.

The gang rivalry is everyday life for young Black men in the hood with no jobs and nowhere to go.</p>
<p align="left">Spike’s creativity comes from a Greek mythology line where the original Lysistrata convinced the women of the time to withhold sex from their men to help end the Peloponnesian War. Spike has updated it to contemporary Chicago and the Englewood community.</p>

When former Cook County Board President Todd Stroger raised county taxes a penny on the dollar to help

balance his budget, he was portrayed as a political monster in the press. He received front-page stories and made headline news.

His election opponent and now Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle ran on the promise that she would repeal Todd’s tax. Truth be told, Todd did the right thing in raising the tax to balance the budget. He was as frugal as possible, a penny

on a dollar. Todd was disrespected.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-3685 alignright" alt="ct-preckwinkle-jpg-20150714" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/ndigo-chit-chat-all-that/files/2015/10/ct-preckwinkle-jpg-20150714-300x168.jpeg" width="300" height="168" />

It is one thing to run for office, it is another to sit in the seat and face the issues after the election. Preckwinkle won and did repeal the tax. However, realizing the economic necessity, Preckwinkle pushed hard to get the 1 percent tax increase reinstated. It barely squeezed by the county board back in July and will take effect January 1, 2016.

taxes
And now here we are again with Preckwinkle at the helm an

d she has proposed increasing the amusement tax by 3 percent to capture revenue from golfers, bowlers, people who subscribe to cable TV and folks who buy sports tickets from secondary outlets like Stub Hub.

That’s in addition to the existing 9 percent amusement tax, which targets theater, musicals, and other live cultural performances and sporting events.

This is too too too damn much, all for a relatively paltry $22 million the expanded amusement tax is expected to bring in, though every penny counts when you’re trying to provide service for people in Cook County.

But people are stressing and straining to keep up with the necessities of life and it’s going a bit too far to tax everyday people trying to find escape in something as simpl

e as bowling with friends or watching a good show on cable.

The County could find other things to tax.

How about adding tax to luxury items like liquor, furs, tobacco,

fine jewelry, luxury cars, boats, electronics, and the like. Commissioner Steele has a good idea, which is to have Cook County Fairs like Taste of Chicago.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3686" alt="taxes-1" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/ndigo-chit-chat-all-that/files/2015/10/taxes-1-300x212.jpg" width="300" height="212" />

The expanded amusement tax will make Chicago a very expensive place for entertainment and sports. In a minute we will have taxes on water, and air and walking on the lake front. But what happens to the politicians that misused

the money. What happened to them? Its shameful the politicians can misuse dollars and then the next group simple tax us some more to make up for the deficit.

In light of this, we see some of the best land in the city gifted to Mr. George Lucas for his Star Wars museum for $10 for a 90-year lease. He will build at his own expense. Why not tax the museum build?

Indeed, taxes probably need to increase, in that it is the most likely way to meet budget expenses, but I hope the public responds and reacts to the proposals to give perspective to the increases and the impact on a public that is struggling as it already is.

the money. What happened to them? Its shameful the politicians can misuse dollars and then the next group simple tax us some more to make up for the deficit.

In light of this, we see some of the best land in the city gifted to Mr. George Lucas for his Star Wars museum for $10 for a 90-year lease. He will build at his own expense. Why not tax the museum build?

Indeed, taxes probably need to increase, in that it is the most likely way to meet budget expenses, but I hope the public responds and reacts to the proposals to give perspective to the increases and the impact on a public that is struggling as it already is.

<p align="left">Our politicians are failing us and America is living in the political basement. Mass killings are occurring in this country every other week on average – in schools, at the movies, on the streets, in church, at the shopping center, on the job.</p>
<p align="left">The profile of the mass shooter is White, male, young, societal reject, failure and most of all, angry loner. Their parents are usually surprised by their actions. Their neighbors usually say they were nice quiet young men. Sometimes those around them miss their troubled souls because they are quiet.</p>
<p align="left">The shooter in Roseburg, Oregon went to the Umpuqua Community College and shot his teacher and other students. Before killing, he asked his victims if they were Christians and if they answered yes, he said, “You are about to meet your God” and shot them in the head. If you answered differently, he shot you in the leg.</p>
<p align="left">This was a religious killing, a hate crime, without dispute. He admired former mass killers and thought the more you kill, the more notable you would become as the news media reported your name.</p>
<p align="left">The police chief of Roseburg said he would not call the shooter’s name. This is a good practice, so as to curtail the notoriety the killer gains from his despicable actions. In the case of the Roseburg killer, the thought of his name being on the news was inspiration.</p>

<p align="left">The politicians debate gun control. Should we or shouldn’t we? The gun lobbyists come forth to fight and always win. There is a mixed emotion. What is often overlooked is that these murderers usually have done all of the proper procedures to obtain their guns. So the strict gun controls might not help in all cases, but how about a dose of common sense?</p>
<p align="left">The murderer in Roseburg had 14 guns and lived with his mother. Did she notice the weapons? If so, didn’t she think something was unusual? Is she guilty of something?</p>
<p align="left">Profiles of these young angry men show that they are mentally disturbed. How do you prevent the mentally ill from getting a gun? How do you prevent the societal reject from being able to obtain a gun? How do you detect the angry young male? How do you identify the hater?</p>
<p align="left">America is raising a violent generation. The young men, Black and White, are angry. Watch what they do. They consume video games, television shows and movies that not only promote violence, but moral corruption as well.</p>
<p align="left">Facebook allows negativity. The more negative you go on Facebook, sometimes the more friends you get. The negative behaviors are encouraged. The video games played say shoot somebody in the head and get more points. Kill somebody and make your mark. Shoot somebody in the leg and get fewer points. The games are gateways to real killing. Parents are not always monitoring and generally oblivious to it, though teachers hear it the classroom.</p>

<p align="left">This is a real question. Many do. In another career, I was a community college professor. After the Oregon shooting, I thought back to my days of teaching. I taught sometimes in all-White male catholic schools and I had a couple of incidents.</p>
<p align="left">The most memorable was in a seminary. My father overheard me discussing the situation, in which I had felt threatened. The young men in a joking fashion engaged in some obscenities with racial overtones in the classroom and on a cold wintry day, they physically picked my car up and moved it to demonstrate their strength. I was supposed to be afraid and I was.</p>
<p align="left">I had another incident at a Black school, where gang activity was talking place in the classroom. I was nervous. My father picked me up one day to take me to the shooting range. Afterwards he gave me a small gun to keep in my purse or pocket. It was registered. I was nervous.</p>
<p align="left">My father was a hunter and a marksman. He enjoyed big game hunting. He explained that a classroom is close quarters and gun violence in a classroom would probably render death – because of close range, not necessarily sharp shooting.</p>
<p align="left">He commented that he would rather get the call that I had shot somebody than from the hospital telling him I was dead because I could not defend myself. He said that if I felt threatened and someone walked up on me in close quarters to start shooting and empty the gun and that would probably stop the aggressor. He said, “You have one question, ‘is it them or is it me?’ I choose you.”</p>
<p align="left">I was uncomfortable carrying the gun, but his point was made and I eventually stopped teaching in the classroom. I just felt that if I had to pack to teach, I should exercise other career options.</p>
<p align="left">Many teachers are afraid of their students and most teachers you speak with can cite violent classroom incidents.</p>
<p align="left">I once had a college student approach me from behind, while I was at the blackboard, with a knife. The students tackled her and probably saved me from a stabbing. The deranged student claimed she had not taken her medicine for the day. I found out she was a student known to have mental issues.</p>
<p align="left">Because of the rules of the institution, the student was readmitted to the class. This was a crazy ruling to me and I took a couple of days off in protest mode.</p>
<p align="left">Should teachers be armed, though, in these days of the heinous school shootings, when a policeman on the grounds is not always enough? The policemen down the hall may not or cannot act soon enough if a crazy with a weapon opens fire in a classroom. A teacher with a gun can at least defend themselves and the class. Maybe. And now along with the fire drill we have kids having shooting drills, too.</p>

<p align="left">My doctoral thesis was way ahead of its time. While teaching, I could see the decline of reading. Book reports were often fabricated with a movie. I saw college students reading less and less. I saw TV dominating and students sometimes confusing TV with a book story. I saw violent behavior being developed.</p>
<p align="left">I recognized the correlation between the hours watched on TV and aggressive behavior. After a while, after a brief conversation with students, I could tell how many hours a person watched TV versus reading. Cognition was being formed, or not being formed in these cases.</p>
<p align="left">And today, with social media and the dominance of the Internet and mobile platforms, it is even more so. Attention spans are very short. Immediate gratification, no matter what, dominates. I observed a lack of patience, more aggression and violence as a means of conflict resolution.</p>
<p align="left">Our educational system is failing. We are raising robotic people with artificial intelligence minus the ability to reason. Intellectual comprehension is challenged as exposure to violence increases.</p>
<p align="left">Our politicians are focused on gun control, but we need to also be watchful and concerned with what our youth are consuming as entertainment.</p>
<p align="left">White young males are killing en mass and Black young males are killing individually, claiming territory. We read about the mass murders and react strongly for the moment, then that subsides until the next incident.</p>
<p align="left">President Obama makes what he is now calling his “routine” speech, but he does not sound presidential. His presidential office could be more authoritative with solutions. Begin the discussion. How about no guns in urban America? That’s a bold move. How about bring your hunting license when you register your gun?</p>

<p align="left">We overlook or seemingly have grown accustomed to the murders in Chicago that are occurring at record levels on the weekends.</p>
<p align="left">Last month was the most violent month in the city since 2002. In the last week of September, 14 people were shot, six fatally. Between January and September of this year, 2,329 men, women and children have been shot in Chicago. The news media reports the weekend murder and shooting statistics like they are giving the score for a sporting event, and it’s become “just another bloody weekend in Chicago.”</p>
<p align="left">The gunfire has spread from struggling neighborhoods long plagued by poverty and violence to so-called “safe” areas of the city, such as Hyde Park-Kenwood, the Chicago home of the President of the United States.</p>
<p align="left">Some of our communities are war zones, yet we embarrassingly deride movie producer Spike Lee for making a movie called Chiraq. Chicago has become a dangerous place; it does not matter the neighborhood.</p>
<p align="left">Police Supt. Gary McCarthy speaks of his former New York efforts and sounds as though he has forgotten REAL TIME in Chicago. Sophisticated police methods are not working on the streets. The police are not fully responsible; neither is the mayor or the aldermen. It’s time for parents to assume responsibility for their children.</p>

<p align="left">As citizens, we should be able to live normal lives. However, this epidemic of street violence is the cocktail discussion in about 15 minutes, no matter what the occasion. As Rev. Jesse Jackson says, “The public space has become Russian roulette – every place is a potential risk.”</p>
<p align="left">People are afraid. Seniors end their days early. If you have to go into certain neighborhoods, it’s a beeline straight in and out, no dallying. Teachers are considering carrying guns, “just in case it’s my classroom.” People are going into extreme mode to protect themselves.</p>
<p align="left">Parents are afraid to let their children grow up normally – playing ball with the guys or going to the playground, or riding the bus, or going to the party, or sitting on the front or back porch with friends. Parents are watchful and think before saying yes to their children’s most mundane outdoor activities.</p>
<p align="left">Families are on watch control, waiting for the call that Johnny or Jill got home safely. Families are having discussions on which family member will take the kids to the show, the party, or the shopping center.</p>
<p align="left">Fear approaches. The violence has metastasized and the terror is expanding. We need solutions. We can’t keep lighting candles, flying balloons and bringing stuffed animals to the site of the crime. It’s time for the political class to engage the people they represent.</p>
<p align="left">When a pregnant mother and grandmother are killed and an 11-month old boy is wounded in an early evening attack on a single family on the streets of the South Side, it’s time for Chicago to bring in the National Guard and to admit that the violence is beyond our capability.</p>

He said that if I felt threatened and someone walked up on me in close quarters to start shooting and empty the gun and that would probably stop the aggressor. He said, “You have one question, ‘is it them or is it me?’ I choose you.”</p>
<p align="left">I was uncomfortable carrying the gun, but his point was made and I eventually stopped teaching in the classroom. I just felt that if I had to pack to teach, I should exercise other career options.</p>
<p align="left">Many teachers are afraid of their students and most teachers you speak with can cite violent classroom incidents.</p>
<p align="left">I once had a college student approach me from behind, while I was at the blackboard, with a knife. The students tackled her and probably saved me from a stabbing. The deranged student claimed she had not taken her medicine for the day. I found out she was a student known to have mental issues.</p>
<p align="left">Because of the rules of the institution, the student was readmitted to the class. This was a crazy ruling to me and I took a couple of days off in protest mode.</p>
<p align="left">Should teachers be armed, though, in these days of the heinous school shootings, when a policeman on the grounds is not always enough? The policemen down the hall may not or cannot act soon enough if a crazy with a weapon opens fire in a classroom. A teacher with a gun can at least defend themselves and the class. Maybe. And now along with the fire drill we have kids having shooting drills, too.</p>

<p align="left">My doctoral thesis was way ahead of its time. While teaching, I could see the decline of reading. Book reports were often fabricated with a movie. I saw college students reading less and less. I saw TV dominating and students sometimes confusing TV with a book story. I saw violent behavior being developed.</p>
<p align="left">I recognized the correlation between the hours watched on TV and aggressive behavior. After a while, after a brief conversation with students, I could tell how many hours a person watched TV versus reading. Cognition was being formed, or not being formed in these cases.</p>
<p align="left">And today, with social media and the dominance of the Internet and mobile platforms, it is even more so. Attention spans are very short. Immediate gratification, no matter what, dominates. I observed a lack of patience, more aggression and violence as a means of conflict resolution.</p>
<p align="left">Our educational system is failing. We are raising robotic people with artificial intelligence minus the ability to reason. Intellectual comprehension is challenged as exposure to violence increases.</p>
<p align="left">Our politicians are focused on gun control, but we need to also be watchful and concerned with what our youth are consuming as entertainment.</p>
<p align="left">White young males are killing en mass and Black young males are killing individually, claiming territory. We read about the mass murders and react strongly for the moment, then that subsides until the next incident.</p>
<p align="left">President Obama makes what he is now calling his “routine” speech, but he does not sound presidential. His presidential office could be more authoritative with solutions. Begin the discussion. How about no guns in urban America? That’s a bold move. How about bring your hunting license when you register your gun?</p>

<p align="left">We overlook or seemingly have grown accustomed to the murders in Chicago that are occurring at record levels on the weekends.</p>
<p align="left">Last month was the most violent month in the city since 2002. In the last week of September, 14 people were shot, six fatally. Between January and September of this year, 2,329 men, women and children have been shot in Chicago. The news media reports the weekend murder and shooting statistics like they are giving the score for a sporting event, and it’s become “just another bloody weekend in Chicago.”</p>
<p align="left">The gunfire has spread from struggling neighborhoods long plagued by poverty and violence to so-called “safe” areas of the city, such as Hyde Park-Kenwood, the Chicago home of the President of the United States.</p>
<p align="left">Some of our communities are war zones, yet we embarrassingly deride movie producer Spike Lee for making a movie called Chiraq. Chicago has become a dangerous place; it does not matter the neighborhood.</p>
<p align="left">Police Supt. Gary McCarthy speaks of his former New York efforts and sounds as though he has forgotten REAL TIME in Chicago. Sophisticated police methods are not working on the streets. The police are not fully responsible; neither is the mayor or the aldermen. It’s time for parents to assume responsibility for their children.</p>

<p align="left">Nationally, every year, the epidemic of gun violence is responsible for 10,000 homicides, 70,000 wounded, 18,000 suicides, 2,000 accidental deaths, and costs the country around $230 billion.</p>
<p align="left">As citizens, we should be able to live normal lives. However, this epidemic of street violence is the cocktail discussion in about 15 minutes, no matter what the occasion. As Rev. Jesse Jackson says, “The public space has become Russian roulette – every place is a potential risk.”</p>
<p align="left">People are afraid. Seniors end their days early. If you have to go into certain neighborhoods, it’s a beeline straight in and out, no dallying. Teachers are considering carrying guns, “just in case it’s my classroom.” People are going into extreme mode to protect themselves.</p>
<p align="left">Parents are afraid to let their children grow up normally – playing ball with the guys or going to the playground, or riding the bus, or going to the party, or sitting on the front or back porch with friends. Parents are watchful and think before saying yes to their children’s most mundane outdoor activities.</p>
<p align="left">Families are on watch control, waiting for the call that Johnny or Jill got home safely. Families are having discussions on which family member will take the kids to the show, the party, or the shopping center.</p>
<p align="left">Fear approaches. The violence has metastasized and the terror is expanding. We need solutions. We can’t keep lighting candles, flying balloons and bringing stuffed animals to the site of the crime. It’s time for the political class to engage the people they represent.</p>
<p align="left">When a pregnant mother and grandmother are killed and an 11-month old boy is wounded in an early evening attack on a single family on the streets of the South Side, it’s time for Chicago to bring in the National Guard and to admit that the violence is beyond our capability.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>What’s In A Name?</strong>
<strong>By Hermene D. Hartman</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>“If you want the Hope Diamond, you have to buy the Hope Diamond.”</strong></p>
<p align="left">This is a direct quote from Michael Jordan’s attorney, Frederick Sperling. And he is only serious. Michael is the Hope Diamond in the field of endorsements, so says his attorney. Mr. Jordan, as you probably know by now, just won $8.9 million from Dominick's, because they didn't have permission to use his likeness.</p>
<p align="left">Watching the court case of Michael Jordan is a world-class lesson on branding. Jordan, of course, is the former Chicago Bulls basketball player and the greatest NBA player ever. He retired from the game twice and Number 23 is now the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
<p align="left">His agent, David Falk, says, Jordan “is the best known celebrity in the world.” Falk’s job is to promote the Michael Jordan brand, sell the Michael Jordan brand, defend the Michael Jordan brand and protect the Michael Jordan brand.</p>
<p align="left">Jordan’s price tag for an endorsement begins at $10 million. He has made far more money off the court in endorsements than playing on the court with his positive, all-American branding. In this court case against Dominick’s Foods being held in Chicago, it has been revealed that Nike paid MJ $480.7 million, Gatorade $18 million, Hanes $14.5 million and Upper Deck $14 million. Last year, Big Mike took in over $100 million in product endorsements.</p>
<p align="left">So, there is a lucrative life after the basketball court for Mike. The popularity of fame, the popularity of celebrity, pays. Solid, clean images pay big. The “Mike” name means something. It stands for something. It represents quality, winning and being a champion. This is contrary to many of the names we see today endorsing products, which is one reason Michael pulls in such big bucks.</p>
<p align="left">Michael has protected his good name in his endorsement enterprises. Lending his name commercially to sell consumer products is big business. Usually, his name is bigger than the company itself, so his name becomes a real asset for them. He is paid handsomely for the use of his name. Whatever Michael Jordan said, or Michael Jordan did, or Michael is wearing, or Michael is holding, results in sales.</p>

<p align="left">Jordan has been very careful over the last 31 years as he has “sold” his name and perfected his brand to be very clear on the companies he has aligned himself with. He is the perfect athlete and has represented exclusively “all American brands.”</p>
<p align="left">No liquor. No cigarettes. No hot dogs. The Jordan endorsement with sports giant Nike is classic advertising representation. Look at McDonald’s, Nike and Hanes. Michael and company is protective of his brand, because it is valued. He has sued other companies before who have misused his name on watches and colognes.

<p align="left">I was sorry to see Dominick’s go out of business. It was a nice company that employed local residents, supported local events and was an overall good Chicago corporate citizen.</p>
<p align="left">Somebody in Dominick’s advertising ranks, probably in a moment of celebration intending to express goodwill and cheer, used Michael’s reputation incorrectly. In a 2009 print ad in a Sports Illustrated issue commemorating Jordan’s selection to the basketball Hall of Fame, they used Jordan’s likeness and his magic number 23 to sell steaks.</p>
<p align="left">They attached $2 off coupons to the ad that said “Michael Jordan…you are a cut above.” Jordan’s suit says the ad basically used his name, likeness and jersey number without his permission or payment. Only two coupons from the ad were redeemed, which is an advertising failure, especially for a big company using a big name.</p>
<p align="left">Jewel-Osco did a similar thing in an ad in the same issue of <em>Sports Illustrated.</em>Both companies were offered free ads by the magazine in return for agreeing to stock the issue of the publication in their stores. It, too, used Jordan’s likeness to insinuate he endorsed Jewel-Osco, and Jordan is suing them, too, in a case set for December.

<p align="left">The lesson of the story here is to protect your good name. What does your name mean, becomes a quality question. What does your name mean and what does it translate to? What is the value of your name and what can your name produce?</p>
<p align="left">This is the brand, the quality, that Jordan is protecting. In this digital age, where tweets, Facebook postings, photos and the like are instant and constant on the Internet, have the rules changed?</p>
<p align="left">Some of the pundits have criticized Jordan’s team over this suit, saying it is much ado about nothing and that Jordan should either ignore it or spank their hands, but not sue them since he already has so much money.</p>
<p align="left">Jordan went to court seeking $10 million in damages from Dominick’s and his reps said all that money would go to charity. The point, here, Mike’s agent David Falk says, is that Team Jordan doesn’t agree to or allow small, one-time deals because they weaken his value and would erode what he gets from the big boys.</p>
<p align="left">Dominick’s lawyers, by the way, say the “23 steak ad” was not worth $10 million. Regardless of how much they think it was worth, they were wrong to use his brand incorrectly and he has to protect it.</p>

<p align="left">The lesson of the story here is to protect your good name. What does your name mean, becomes a quality question. What does your name mean and what does it translate to? What is the value of your name and what can your name produce?</p>
<p align="left">This is the brand, the quality, that Jordan is protecting. In this digital age, where tweets, Facebook postings, photos and the like are instant and constant on the Internet, have the rules changed?</p>
<p align="left">Some of the pundits have criticized Jordan’s team over this suit, saying it is much ado about nothing and that Jordan should either ignore it or spank their hands, but not sue them since he already has so much money.</p>
<p align="left">Jordan went to court seeking $10 million in damages from Dominick’s and his reps said all that money would go to charity. The point, here, Mike’s agent David Falk says, is that Team Jordan doesn’t agree to or allow small, one-time deals because they weaken his value and would erode what he gets from the big boys.</p>
<p align="left">Dominick’s lawyers, by the way, say the “23 steak ad” was not worth $10 million. Regardless of how much they think it was worth, they were wrong to use his brand incorrectly and he has to protect it.</p>

<p align="left">What do you do with a fallen hero? Do you toss him out as trash? Do you give him the benefit of the doubt? Do you forget about him? Do you beat him up while he’s down? Do you remember his good deeds and forget his bad? Do you stand still?</p>
<p align="left">These are questions we face regarding <strong>Bill Cosby</strong>, who has been accepted as “America’s Father” for decades and upheld as a paragon of virtue during that time.</p>
<p align="left">That’s what makes Cosby’s fall from grace so astounding, because he was at the peak of the moral mountaintop and we accepted all his chiding about the proper way to raise families and conduct ourselves – especially the Black community – because, after all, Father Knows Best. But obviously, in Cosby’s case, what you see is not what you get.</p>
<p align="left"><em>New York Magazine’s</em> July cover story features the personal stories of 35 of the 46 women who have come forth accusing Cosby of sexual assault and rape, with most of the incidents occurring after Cosby had allegedly drugged them. The women appear on the cover of the magazine in individual seats, with one seat left open, signifying that there may be others who received the alleged Cosby treatment.</p>
<p align="left">Their stories are all pretty similar, with Cosby allegedly drugging the ladies and having his way with them in some form or fashion – that is, he did something sexual with them, and they may not have been fully conscious of their actions at the time – in acts that certainly did not seem to be consensual, since the drugged victims were in no condition to really consent to anything.</p>
<p align="left">These women in their collective did not come forward at the time of their incidents with Cosby for fear that no one would believe them and that their truth might be harmful to them. This is a common sentiment among women who have been rape victims, especially when rich, famous, and powerful men have been the perpetrators.</p>

<p align="left">Cosby obviously lead a double life from the time he first gained celebrity, even before his I Spy days. On one hand, he was the man we saw on TV and America grew to love. He raised the bar, presenting a new image of the middle-class Black American family – a wholesome picture.
He was funny, witty and gave us family stories that all could relate to. He became quite wealthy and donated significant dollars to Black institutions like Spellman. He became an art collector, recognizing the talent of Black artists, and was a strong supporter of the Black culture community.</p>
<p align="left">He supported Black causes. He did it right. He didn’t forget his roots, his community, his people. He began to address the social ills of Black America and went on tour to say straighten up to a generation that he thought was not on par. He was even funny in his preachiness.</p>
<p align="left">But then there was this other side that was not so funny. I am sure that being on top of the world like Cosby was with his Dr. Huxtable weekly TV show – around the period when most of these incidents are alleged to have happened – he could have had, sexually and consensually, almost any woman who orbited his sphere.</p>
<p align="left">He probably did not have to drug anybody to have sex, and yet he did. What kind of man is this? One of the women who came forth said she was a long-time associate of Cosby’s whom she trusted implicitly and that he had never remotely tried anything with her. But one day, he gave her pills and when she came to, she was naked in bed with a friend of Cosby’s next to her, with Cosby in the room. Realizing what happened, she said she screamed, “Do you like eff-ing dead people?” before she left.</p>

<p align="left">Cosby took advantage of women. He worked his casting couch on false pretense. He solicited the pretty ones from the modeling agencies and the Playboy clubs. They came in all shapes, colors and styles. They were models, writers, actresses and the like.</p>
<p align="left">They maybe wanted a shot at show biz and Cosby was willing to mentor, or they liked being in the limelight, or they maybe wanted something he had to offer and it’s possible they may have been more than willing to barter sex to get what they wanted from him.</p>
<p align="left">But no matter what their reason for being around him or willingness or eagerness even to have sex with him, it’s quite another thing to wake up from a drug stupor with someone inside you or other obvious signs that you have been unconsciously molested. No one deserves that, no matter what their intentions might have been. That’s a crime.</p>
<p align="left">What kind of man seeks drugged women for his sexual pleasure anyway? She cannot respond or responds slowly. She does not remember or has vague memory. Is this really pleasurable?
One of the most unnerving aspects of the New York magazine story as the women share their tales, is the number of them remembering the look on Cosby’s face at the time of the alleged sexual encounters. It seems that his Dr. Jekyll side came out.</p>
<p align="left">Apparently, Cosby did not seek real relationships with these women; they were simply, for the short term? Why didn’t he go to prostitutes? Why didn’t he just pay them for sex? What’s wrong with this picture? He used his power wrongly. He punished women if they did not cooperate. He banned them from career moves or bad-mouthed them to his peers.</p>
<p align="left">I didn’t want to believe the Cosby mishap, but when you see all these accusers on the cover of a magazine and hear their similar stories, the denying is over.</p>
<p align="left">I keep waiting for someone to explain, but no one can explain. His testimony in the deposition from a decade ago that appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>involving the young woman from Temple University reveals Cosby’s devilment in his very own words. Who or where was his lawyer?
He talked about his sexual conquests in the deposition like he was reciting his memoirs. Was this arrogance or pathology? Is Bill Cosby a psychopath? He most certainly seems to be a serial sexual predator who got thrills from drugging and assaulting women. What if one had died from the drugs; what if one of the women had committed suicide over the incident?
Cosby has disgraced himself, his family and his fame. He probably won’t go to jail or be tried in the court of law for his bad deeds because of the statue of limitations. Most of his raping was done 20 to 30 years ago. But he has been sufficiently tried in the court of public opinion and found guilty.</p>
<p align="left">And he has been ordered to give another deposition on October 9, related to a lawsuit filed by a California woman who claims Cosby molested her in 1974 when she was 15.
This is the legacy that now comes with Mr. Bill Cosby. What do you do when a hero has fallen?</p>

<p align="left">She was smoking in the privacy of her vehicle. Smoking in your car is not a crime and does not merit severe police treatment. Why did the cop throw her to the ground?

<p align="left">For the past few weeks, I have watched the news on <strong>Cecil</strong> the lion.

<p align="left">Black America has got to face reality. The most dangerous person in America is the officer with the gun. When he stops you, be polite, watch your tone, watch your words, and watch your mouth.</p>
<p align="left">Note that they don’t care who you are – the minister, the president, the government official, the church lady, the teacher, the businessperson, the doctor, the lawyer, or the bus driver. It is open season on Black people doing ordinary things. We are under attack.</p>
<p align="left">An officer stopped me recently. I was turning in downtown Chicago and the sign indicated that turning was permitted after 6 pm. My watch had 6 straight up. The patty wagon officer said it was not six. He asked for my driver license and insurance card. I politely complied. I was quite conscience of my tone. I showed him the time on my watch. He showed me the time on his. He asked, could I be fast. I asked, could he be slow? He smiled, and said move on, but remember the six o’clock rule. Politely, I thanked him. I couldn’t believe my heart was beating so fast.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot get justice on the street when the police stop you, for one simple reason. He has the gun and his decision rules. His split-second decision rules. You might get to court, you might not…the objective is to get home.</p>
<p align="left">The troublesome part is that they kill with no responsibility. It is the cop’s word against yours and the system supports him or her. He might be disciplined, only to return to the street again.</p>

1. Make no false moves.
2. Do not get out of your car unless the police asks you to.
3. The officer is in charge; let him tell you what he wants you to do.
4. If asked for your license or insurance card, tell the officer where it is and that you are going for it. If you are male and your papers are in the glove compartment, be extra careful and reach slowly.
5. Do not raise your voice.
6. Be polite at all times.
7. Do not argue with the police. If a confrontation is brewing, try to get in the middle of the street, to attract public attention or request going to the station.
8. Watch the tone of your voice.
