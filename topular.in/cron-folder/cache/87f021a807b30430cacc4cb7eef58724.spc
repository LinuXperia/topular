<p>I'm the idiot who waits until the year actually ends before rolling out my Best Of... list every year, and that's because I'm often able to squeeze in a dozen or more films in the last couple weeks of December, mostly stuff that others have told me is worth checking out that I either missed when it came out in Chicago or titles that simply never came out locally.</p></p>

<p>By my count, I saw 455 films in 2015 (10 less than last year &mdash; I'm slipping!), either in a theater or via screener &mdash; from <em>Paddington</em> to <em>Point Break</em>. This number does include a few vintage titles, but only if I saw them in a theater (often as a restored print, but not always). If I simply watched an older film at home, that doesn't make the list. As I do every year, I've separated out the documentaries because I want an excuse to call extra attention to a whole other batch of worthy films (20 this year) that might go unnoticed on my main list. Plus, it's always seemed strange to me to mix docs and features; the same way you don't usually see fiction and nonfiction books shelved together in a bookstore.</p>
        <p>I was genuinely shocked at how many great movies didn't make my Top 10, or even my Top 20, as I was assembling this list. I often feel that after the first 10, the numbers don't mean much, and that's never been more true. Of my top 15, I saw 12 of them more than once, many of them three times just to help me finalize this list.</p>

<p>I say this every year, but I'll say it again anyway: If you think a list of 50 films is an annoyingly huge, feel free to stop reading at 30, or 20, or 10. Of course 50 is indulgent; you'll find ways of dealing with it, I have faith. I've included sections of my original reviews for my Top 10 films, with the exception of <em>Anomalisa</em>, the review for which will run next week. Hope you dig the list and that it gives you some ideas for purchases, streaming, rentals, going to the theater and actually checking them out the old-school way. A few of these are still in theaters, and if they are, that's where you should view them. A couple of them will make their way to you in January. Alright, enough preamble. Here is my humbly submitted Top 50 best features and Top 20 best documentaries of 2015. Please enjoy and discuss.</p>

<p><strong>1. <em>Ex Machina</em></strong><br />
The film is not a film about whether the AI known as Ava (Alicia Vikander) is good or evil; it's about whether she could ever become aware. It's less about whether she likes or loves someone; it's about whether she fully grasps what those concepts are. Writer-director Alex Garland is far more interested in capturing subtle acts of manipulation and the consequences of such actions rather than seeing what Ava's reaction times are. There's a metaphor brought up more than once in the film about the magician's assistant being a distraction so that the magician can perform an illusion. There's a lot of that at play here, and having seen the film several times now, I can see that <em>Ex Machina</em> is a very different, though no less fascinating, work with each viewing.</p>

<p>Watching Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac converse and move around each other is endlessly entertaining. But Vikander is the real discovery here. Every move, intonation, and expression is carefully calculated. She moves fluidly but also as you'd expect an advanced robot might. And don't fool yourself for a second, she's working us as an audience just as much as she is Gleeson's Caleb in the film. She wants us to fall under her subtle spell, and we do. <em>Ex Machina</em> is a masterfully constructed work &mdash; an exercise in complex thought and visual simplicity. And we come to realize that the real danger of AI is how its existence reflects upon us. When we start treating machines like feeling creatures, what does that say about humanity? Yes, you should see this film, but then you should see it again and again.</p>

<p><strong>2. <em>Anomalisa</em></strong><br />
I'll have a full review (as well as an interview with co-directors Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson) next week, but I can say that this film is, all at once, heartfelt, disturbing, funny, romantic, and emotionally complex. It's ripe for interpretation and conversation, and the lead character is both a tragic character looking for connection and a selfish being that fears commitment. The fact that Anomalisa also happens to be a stunning technical achievement in stop-motion animation is almost secondary, except it isn't because it never wants us to forget that so much about the film feels quite real but isn't. Another true master stroke from Kaufman that, once again, gives us a story about characters in search of their unique version of reality.</p>

<p>I should mention that, to celebrate the upcoming release of <em>Anomalisa</em>, Landmark's Century Centre Cinema is proud to present an exclusive Charlie Kaufman Retrospective, featuring the work of the Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The four-day retrospective will run January 4-7, 2016 at 1pm with special screenings of four of Kaufman's most critically acclaimed films: <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, Jan. 4; <em>Adaptation</em>, Jan. 5; <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, Jan. 6; and <em>Synecdoche, New York</em>, Jan. 7. Tickets for all of these shows are now on sale at the <a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/chicago/century-centre-cinema#upcoming" target="_blank">Landmark Theatres website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></strong><br />
This film is not a two-hour chase scene &mdash; not even close. There are plenty of breaks in the action &mdash; and you'll probably need them just to catch your breath and figure out what the hell is going on. But it's more than just about taking a moment to decompress. Writer-director Geroge Miller's pacing is remarkable, and what happens during these pauses in the action are important to the bigger picture and messages of the film. When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and her crew get where they're going, it opens up the truer meanings of <em>Fury Road</em> in remarkable ways. The practical stunts are like nothing you've ever seen, both as pure cinematic violence eruptions and from a purely technical standpoint. Miller has turned car crashes, people getting sucked under the wheels of a semi, and fiery explosions into works of art that will stand up against anything hanging in The Louvre. Yeah, I said it. Now go have yourself a destructive good time.</p>

<p><strong>4. <em>Inside Out</em></strong><br />
A friend of mine said something interesting after watching the latest understated Pixar masterpiece, <em>Inside Out</em>: "This film could actually help people." And I don't think he meant that the emotion-based story might brighten people's day. I didn't give his prediction much thought until many hours later, after hearing the many children in the audience talk to their parents about who their favorite emotion character was and why. But when I considered it, I realized that with just one screening, I could imagine kids opening up about and understanding their feelings, giving them a visual representation of what goes on in their heads when they get mad at a situation or person. I envision a 9-year-old noticing that Lewis Black's Anger character or Bill Hader's Fear is getting the best of them, and maybe allowing it to happen or making sure that Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) wins the day.</p>

<p>But the more I thought about it, I realized that the film might also inspire adults &mdash; particularly parents &mdash; to reconsider they way children's minds operate. As simple as the Pixar team (led by director and co-writer Peter Docter, who also helmed <em>Up</em> and <em>Monsters Inc.</em>) make the processes of the brain appear, there's also a great complexity and occasional darkness at play. Examine the brilliant trip that Joy and Sadness (Phyllis Smith of "The Office") take into 11-year-old Riley's mental room containing Abstract Thought. I can't think of a single moment in any Pixar movie that has approached getting that obtuse. Or take a look at Riley's closely guarded prison of the Subconscious, where all of her deepest fears are housed. Docter and his team fill every corner of the frame with gags and bits of brilliance that demand you check out the film two or three times at least. It's that joyous and worthy of celebration.</p>

<p><strong>5. <em>The Martian</em></strong><br />
No one involved in the story of <em>The Martian</em> or the audience watching it is more aware of how ridiculous the situation is that astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself than Watney. And we know this because Watney jokes about it constantly, turning what is a certain-death scenario into a story that celebrates and encourages unparalleled hope, bravery, creativity, intelligence and camaraderie. It's science fiction that puts nearly all of its emphasis on science, that isn't afraid to bombard us with formulas, geometry and physics as well as those who excel at figuring stuff out. Hell, Watney is a botanist, so we get a few lessons about growing things on a planet where nothing grows, mainly because there's no water (oops!). We seem to live in an age where certain groups see science and using one's brain as untrustworthy notions, and it would break my heart if audiences stayed away from this film for that reason. But <em>The Martian</em> has filled me with hope, so I'm going to just assume all of you have already purchased your tickets and are lining up as you read this. Enjoy this one immensely. </p>

<p><strong>6. <em>Sicario</em></strong><br />
Easily one of the finest films you'll see all year, director Denis Villeneuve's (<em>Prisoners</em>, <em>Incendies</em>) <em>Sicario</em> is so good for so many reasons that to break it down into its elements seems sacrilegious, since the complex ways the pieces interconnect is the largest part of its perfection. On the surface, the film is a cynical yet authentic look at the state of the ongoing, bloody drug war happening on a daily basis along the border between the U.S. and Mexico. But what's going on under the surface of <em>Sicario</em> is what makes it so damn sinister and brilliant and soul crushing. The film will absolutely be part of the end-of-year conversation and rightfully so. If you are a sucker for a happy, neatly tied up end, look elsewhere. Go back the kids' table and finish your juice box. This film is for grown folks who enjoy using their brains while watching movies and have a clear sense of the dirty world around them. If that sounds like you, you're in for a hell of a time at the movies. </p>

<p><strong>7. <em>Spotlight</em></strong><br />
My greatest fear when it comes to easily one of the finest-made films of the year, director Tom McCarthy's <em>Spotlight</em>, is that the unsavory nature of the story may keep people from checking it out. If that's currently your line of thinking, congratulations, you don't give a shit about quality movies. The film is not about the uncovering of pedophile priests per se, since vague allegations and accusations had been rumbling throughout Boston for years. What made the Spotlight team's year-long digging and resulting stories so important was the depth of the cover-up, which extended far into the legal community and the local government, in addition to ranking members of the Vatican, including Boston's Cardinal Law. What McCarthy as director and co-writer (along with Josh Singer) does with his film is painstakingly reveal the journalistic process that went into this Pulitzer Prize-winning series, resulting in one of the most breathtaking thrillers in recent memory. <em>Spotlight</em> a magnificent achievement in storytelling and pure filmmaking. </p>

<p><strong>8. <em>Brooklyn</em></strong><br />
Working from an elegant Nick Hornby adaptation of the novel by Colm Tóibín, director John Crowley takes his time building up a sense of time and place, without rushing us through the story or getting us buried in the politics or events of the time, which have little bearing on this very personal story. <em>Brooklyn</em> allows us to share in Eilis' longing for both country and love, but she also makes it clear that she doesn't need either to feel fulfilled. This is a film about the tribulations of the heart that manages to stay unsentimental by simply laying out the dilemma and allowing our heroine a few extra moments to contemplate her options as well as her desires. This is a nice little cheek pinch of a movie that has a full appreciation for what a love story should be. </p>

<p><strong>9. <em>Phoenix</em></strong><br />
One of the most talked about films on the festival circuit since last year's Toronto Film Festival is the latest collaboration between writer-director Christian Petzold and actress Nina Hoss. <em>Phoenix</em> is an entirely different piece of magic and represents a truly brilliant bit of cinematic unfolding that will have your mind racing and expectations shattered by its jaw-dropping conclusion. The piecing together of a life and of a country after traumatic events are two very different journeys, but somehow Petzold makes them feel similarly painful as they desperately want to emerge for the better. The film is easily in the running for one of the best films you'll see all year. </p>

<p><strong>10. <em>It Follows</em></strong><br />
In 2010, writer-director David Robert Mitchell gave audiences a peek inside the lives and minds of teenagers in a quaint Michigan suburb with <em>The Myth of the American Sleepover</em>, for which he was rightfully applauded for presenting these pre-adults with a certain amount of accuracy, dignity and maturity, while still making it clear that these kids were still kids. Shifting genres, but without abandoning his gift for painting young people as fully realized people, Mitchell has developed one of the truly creepiest films in years. The plot and execution of <em>It Follows</em> are so deceptively simple that one almost wonders why other horror filmmakers rely so much on computer-generated special effects, often with meager results. Many of the creeping evil's nuances, weaknesses and limitations ("the rules," if you will) are left for us to discover as we go, making the entire experience that much more terrifying. Mitchell's sidestep into horror feels more like the continuation of a natural, confident evolution in his filmmaking. Let's hope we don't have to wait another four years for the next step in his journey.</p>

<h3>Best Documentaries of 2015</h3>
<p>Every year, I separate out documentaries, not because I feel they should be judged differently than feature films, but because I want to put as many great doc titles in front of you as I possibly can, and trying to do that and still limit my main list to 50 films is an impossibility. I get such a wonderful charge from a great documentary, whether it's on a subject I know something about or it covers ground I'd never even considered in terms of perspective, information, or sources of outrage. Sometimes, it's just the sheer beauty of a subject that movies me; often times, it's something quite ugly and worth despising. It's tough catching docs in theaters these days (for example, <em>Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief</em> didn't make my list because I saw it, like many of you, on HBO and not in a theater), and someday soon, I may have to rethink how I compile this specific list &mdash; considering films that originated on the festival circuit but never got even an art-house release, instead landing on cable, PBS, etc. While I figure that out, this list of 20 should keep you busy for time.</p>

<p><strong>1. <em>Call Me Lucky</em></strong>
To label director Bobcat Goldthwait's <em>Call Me Lucky</em> as simply "inspiring" doesn't begin to explain how good it is or how stirring comedian Barry Crimmins' journey has been (and still is). The film received a double standing ovation (rightfully so) at Sundance, and I have continued to mull over and contemplate certain aspects of it in my mind on an almost daily basis. In a just, sensible world, Crimmins would have statues erected to him as well as his own national holiday; he would hate that, of course, but at the very least, do what you can to see this remarkable film.  The film is far more than the sum total of its shocking moments, to be sure, but when it takes the unexpected turn into Crimmins' dark, pre-comedy history, it elevates the movie to such a degree that you feel like you're watching the most vivid confessional ever committed to film.

        <p>I think I'll take the plunge and write the last post on Gapers Block before it goes on hiatus in an hour or so. I've been A/C page editor for a year and theater/arts writer for almost three years. Shorter tenure than many of the veteran GB writers, but I have written 284 posts during that time. I'm going to miss Gapers Block very much. It has been invigorating intellectually and emotionally to have a place to write regularly about the arts I love--theater, art, design, architecture, sometimes books or music.</p>

<p>My first <a href="http://gapersblock.com/bookclub/2013/05/07/richard_hell_revisits_his_life_in_punk_rock/">post</a> was in May 2013 for the Book Club page. It was a feature on Richard Hell, the punk rock performer of the '70s, best known for his "Please Kill Me" shirt. He talked, answered questions and signed copies of his new book (<em>I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp</em>) at the Book Cellar on Lincoln Avenue and I felt fortunate to see the bass player and singer with the Voidoids, Television and the Heartbreakers. The fact that the Book Club editor let me write a feature about him made it even more rewarding. </p>
        <p>And I want to thank Andrew Huff and LaShawn Williams, former A/C editor, for helping me learn the ropes of writing for GB and using our creaky content management system. </p>

<p>My GB articles have been mostly theater reviews--I have made an effort to cover a lot of smaller, storefront theaters because they don't always get the visibility they deserve. But i've also written about productions at the larger Equity houses. Writing about theater and working to become a better reviewer and critic have been my constant goals. </p>

<p>I have also written on many other arts subjects. My last <a href="http://gapersblock.com/ac/2015/12/28/at-the-mca-pop-art-design-gives-us-a-refresher-course-on-the-60s-and-70s/">article</a> was a review of the Pop Art Design exhibit at the MCA, posted a few days ago.</p>

<p>We have also had an amazing array of other writers on the A/C page. Nicole Lane is an artist and an arts journalist who writes interesting interviews with artists and reviews of exhibits beyond the mainstream. Adam Morgan is a fine theater and literary reviewer. Kim Campbell loves to write about circuses, puppets and many offbeat art forms. Jeanne Newman often takes a skewed personal perspective (when the production demands it) and she also likes to write about food. Her article on Chicago's Italian beef tradition received many comments. Miriam Finder has written about dance with skill and feeling. Sarah Brooks, the Transmission editor, has also written about theater and other A/C topics. Steve Prokopy can be depended upon to give a zing to his film reviews. </p>

<p>Those writers plus Emma Terhaar from Book Club and eight to ten other GB writers are joining me in creating a new website to cover Chicago arts and culture, which, of course, includes food. Our new website, <a href="http://thirdcoastreview.com" target="_blank">Third Coast Review</a>, should launch officially in about 10 days. It won't be Gapers Block, and it can never replace Gapers Block, but we'll cover our part of Chicago with as much love, passion and crankiness as we did while writing right here. So bye bye, Gapers Block, it's been fun and I wish it could have lasted longer. But nothing lasts forever, or so I'm told. </p>

        <p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/GB-MCAPopArt_exhibitview-leadimage.jpg" width="560" alt="Pop Art Design at MCA Chicago" /><br /><span class="s"><em>Pop Art Design exhibition view. Photos by Nathan Keay.</em></span></p>

<p>It may be your father's pop art, but the work shown in the new exhibit at the <a href="https://mcachicago.org/Home">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> is still fresh and fun. The art that shocked the elite art world 50 years ago still has a story to tell today. </p>

<p>The new <em>Pop Art Design</em> exhibit at the MCA pairs 150 art works and design objects in an exhibit that sparkles with wit and irreverence. And it reminds you of how Andy Warhol's "Campbell soup can art" was first received with ridicule...by non-connoisseurs. That was just about the time that the elite collectors woke up and began buying Warhols. </p>
        <p>The exhibit, which originated at the Vitra Design Museum in Germany, is paired with <em>The Street, the Store and the Silver Screen</em>, a companion exhibit of seminal works of pop art drawn from the MCA's own collection, along with some local loans. Some of these works haven't been seen in years or have never been displayed.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/GB-MCA-Marshmallow_Sofa.jpg" width="560" alt="Pop Art Design at MCA Chicago" /><br /><span class="s"><em>George Nelson, Marshmallow Sofa, 1956.</em></span></p>

<p>The original pop art works are still brazen, vivid and just a little outrageous. Michael Darling (the MCA's chief curator) has organized the exhibit into mini-themes such as Reality as Collage, the Female Fetish, Clichés of Modern Life and Everyday Heroes. The paired exhibits make clear how pop art influenced the look of furniture, architecture, consumer products, typography and graphic design. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/GB-MCA-PopArt_installationview-paschke-elcina.jpg" width="560" alt="Pop Art Design at MCA Chicago" /><br /><span class="s"><em>Ed Paschke, Elcina, 1973, and James Rosenquist, Woman I, 1963. </em></span></p>

<p>George Nelson's "Marshmallow Sofa" from 1956 still looks good enough to eat or sit on. Claes Oldenburg's "Green Beans" (1964) are surely ready to cook and Studio 65's "Bocca" (red mouth) is cushy and welcoming. Two whimsical pieces by Niki de Saint Phalle are included in the Female Fetish section, reminding me of the fabulous exhibit of her giant sculptures at <a href="http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=418341">Garfield Park</a> in 2007. Ed Paschke is represented by several works, including Casey (1975) and Elcina (1973). </p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/GB-MCAS-Bocca.jpg" width="560" alt="Pop Art Design at MCA Chicago" /><br /><span class="s"><em>Studio 65, Bocca, 1970</em></span></p>

<p>Those two exhibits fill the museum's fourth floor. On the second floor, another exhibit provides insights from surrealists of several eras. Some 100 paintings, sculptures, drawings and photos from the MCA collection are shown in <em>Surrealism: The Conjured Life</em>. The exhibit is in a large freestanding spiral in the center of a gallery on the second floor, with the inner gallery walls devoted to "classical" European surrealists such as Yves Tanguy, Rene Magritte and Jean Dubuffet. The outer spiral walls display international contemporary artists with an affinity to surrealism. Here we see works by artists like Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman, Lee Bontecou and Gabriel Orozco. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/GB-MCA-PopArt-Surrealism-Magritte.jpg" width="560" alt="Pop Art Design at MCA Chicago" /><br /><span class="s"><em>René Magritte, Les merveilles de la nature (The Wonders of Nature), 1953.</em></span></p>

<p>The gallery walls outside the spiral feature artists associated with Chicago including members of the Chicago Imagists (Jim Nutt, Gladys Nilsson and Ed Paschke) and those earlier artists known as the "Monster Roster" (Don Baum, June Leaf and Leon Golub). There's also work from a diverse group of recent Chicago artists such as Henry Darger, Patty Carroll and Marcos Raya.</p>

<p>The <em>Surrealism</em> exhibit adds an element of classicism to the <em>Pop Art Design</em> exhibit; it puts those repetitive silkscreened images, soup cans, green beans, and giant mouths into historical context. </p>

<p>The MCA security guards even have clever new t-shirts as part of the museum's new <a href="https://mcachicago.org/Stories/Blog/2015/11/New-Identity">"grid" identity.</a> The front of the black shirt trumpets "Avant" in large white letters, while the back reminds you he is in fact a "Guard." </p>

<p><em>Pop Art Design</em> continues at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 220 E. Chicago Ave., through March 27. <em>Surrealism: The Conjured Life</em> will be on display through June 5. Hours are 10am to 8pm on Tuesdays and 10am to 5pm Wednesday through Sunday. (They'll be closed on New Year's Day.) Admission is $12 and $7 for students and seniors. Members are admitted free. </p>

<p>For more than a few raving cinephiles, watching a Quentin Tarnatino film is a bit like going on a scavenger hunt through the filmmaker's personal movie library. It's a history lesson where the students (i.e. the audience) must teach themselves enough about a certain type of film history to catch all of the references. The danger of watching any movie this way is that some may get so excited about identifying the references that they mistake this sense of accomplishment for the film actually being good. </p></p>

<p>Fortunately for us, Tarantino cares more about creating richly drawn and downright freaky characters just a little bit more than he does trying to play guessing games. He's also become something of a master at crafting stories that not only make it damn near impossible to predict the ending, but the journey itself is an intricately woven garment made of stitching that never quite goes in a straight line and is just as much of a mystery.</p>
        <p><em>The Hateful Eight</em>, Tarantino's eighth feature, is a true and proper Western (<em>Django Unchained</em> is arguably more of a Southern), set in Wyoming a short number of years after the end of the Civil War. The timeframe is vague, but it's clear that those members of the titular eight who served during the battle between the North and South still harbor old grudges and bear old wounds &mdash; physical and otherwise. The details of the vast landscape are obscured by deep, blinding snow. As the film opens, we see a stagecoach racing across the screen, toward the town of Red Rock where one of the coach's passengers, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is being delivered to the local law to be tried and hanged by her neck, courtesy of the other passenger, bounty hunter John "The Hangman" Ruth (Kurt Russell). The two are handcuffed together, presumably until death they do part.</p>

<p>The coach, driven by the purposeful O.B. Jackson (James Parks and not officially one of the Eight), is just barely staying ahead of a nasty blizzard that will likely force it to stop before Red Rock. Making this all the more likely are two unplanned stops the carriage makes to pick up stranded bystanders on the road. The first is Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a black former union soldier (still in uniform), who is also a bounty hunter, with three dead bodies stacked up (each worth a pretty penny) and a horse, dead from exhaustion; the other stranger is Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), about as nasty a southern cracker as there ever was, who says he's the new sheriff of Red Rock, and that unless they take him, Ruth will have no one to turn Daisy in to and get paid.</p>

<p>Tarantino's writing is so carefully paced and his reveals so perfectly timed that he could have made a 90-minute film about these four people in a stage coach, and that would have been a hell of an experience. Just enough of each one of their lives is revealed that we get a sense of both their shared and dissimilar histories. Mannix is the son of a known scoundrel and was a member of a notorious gang of killers during the war, while Warren was a legend and is said by many to have been a personal pen pal of President Lincoln himself (he carries one of the many letters from Lincoln to prove it).</p>

<p>On the other side of the coach are the shackled captor and captive, with Daisy being one of the nastiest, most racist pieces of work you'll see in a movie this year. For a film with only one prominent black character in it, a certain racial slur gets tossed around rather freely and frequently by all. It's a Tarantino film, so this isn't exactly a surprise. Leigh is like a wild animal, cursing, lying, thrashing and occasionally taking a punch with the best of them.</p>

<p>The film expands its scope upon the arrival at Minnie's Haberdashery, at which we are introduced to the other half of our Eight &mdash; three wayward travelers, including Tim Roth's Oswaldo Mobray, a British-born hangman by trade, who just happens to be headed Red Rock as well; Michael Madsen as cowboy Joe Gage, headed to see his ailing mother near the town, who also seems to be penning his life story to kill the time; and Bruce Dern as General Sandy Smithers, a southern officer known for killing black soldiers rather than taking them captive during the war &mdash; a fact Warren is all too familiar with. Rounding out the eight is Bob (Demian Bichir), a Mexican whom the absent Minnie left in charge of the cabin/general store. Not long after their arrival, Ruth makes it clear to Warren that he's certain one or more of these men is not who he claims to be and that likely there is a plot afoot to spring Daisy from her chains. He's not wrong.</p>

<p>Despite a great deal of talking, double dealing, shocking reveals, and a tremendous amount of blood, the rest of the film is a surprisingly faithful remake of John Carpenter's <em>The Thing</em>, right down the presence of Kurt Russell, a lot of snow, and a wonderfully retro-sounding new score by Ennio Morricone (Tarantino also uses a section of Morricone's music from <em>The Thing</em> in this film, as if to acknowledge the homage). More specifically, the writer-director recreates Carpenter's feeling of dread, claustrophobia and paranoia from that film, as Russell attempts to figure out who among them is genuine and who are harmful. Each character is asked to reveal their personal story and what brought them to Minnie's, and Ruth judges their believability accordingly</p>

<p>If he'd set his mind to it, Tarantino could have staged this tale as a theater piece, since most of the film takes place in one of two settings. But if he'd done that, audiences would have missed out on <em>The Hateful Eight</em>'s most prized asset &mdash; its presentation in Ultra Panavision 70mm. There's no reason to miss this impossibly rare opportunity to see the film projected this way, as wide and breathtaking as it gets, courtesy of Tarantino and Scorsese favorite, cinematographer Robert Richardson, who captures the expansive, desolate Wyoming terrain with such detail, you feel you can dive headfirst into the endless snow. It's almost humorous that so much of the film takes place in cramped quarters (either in the coach or the cabin), yet somehow the Panavision still does its job &mdash; in this case, you can practically fit the entire room in the frame, so there's a great deal to look at and pay close attention to. Set aside the better part of three-and-a-half hours for the full-length roadshow version of the movie, which includes introductory music, an intermission, and three hours of movie.</p>

<p>At a certain explosive moment in <em>The Hateful Eight</em>, the film's timeline jumps back to earlier in the day (the entire film takes place in less than 24 hours) to the couple of hours before the stagecoach arrived at Minnie's, and before long, most of the film's big secrets are revealed in what appears to be an entirely different film set at the same cabin. We meet Minnie (Dana Gourrier), as well as some of her employees, including one played by Zoe Bell (best known for her work as Uma Thuman's stunt double in the <em>Kill Bill</em> films, as well as for riding the hood of a car in <em>Death Proof</em>). We also meet a character played by Channing Tatum, and the less known about him, the better.</p>

<p>During the bloody final act of <em>The Hateful Eight</em>, enemies become allies, partners consider jumping ship on each other, and hell is unleashed in the close quarters of the haberdashery. We may have come to expect this from Tarantino at this point, but it's also exactly what we need in movies right now. No lives are beyond ending, no sacred-cow actor is too legendary to Tarantino that he/she can't be murdered (special recognition must go out to Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, whose blood-and-guts make-up work is so grotesquely splashy, their names come immediately after Tarantino's in the end credits). The director refuses to sit back and adhere to conventional storytelling, and modern filmmaking is all the better for it.</p>

<p>It's no accident that the only character who never lies holds a special place in the final moments of <em>The Hateful Eight</em>. This is no morality tale, and you may not like that it's this particular person who reaches this pinnacle, but you can take some comfort in the fact that the story's most honest creation will likely be the person to retell the tale down the line. Tarantino has birthed a down-and-dirty, snow-blasted, leathery tall tale, and he's presenting it in a way that hides nothing and gives audiences a screen size finally large enough to hold one of his wonderfully realized stories. It's a perfect storm for movie lovers, Tarantino admirers, and those who appreciate a bit of spectacle with their gun play.</p>

<p><em>The Hateful Eight</em> is opening Christmas Day at select theaters around Chicago, but the only place worth seeing it is <a href="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/hateful-eight" target="_blank">the Music Box Theater</a> (it will open in a couple other Chicago-area theaters shortly thereafter), where it will be presented Ultra Panavision 70mm on a new 40-foot screen (double the size of the theater's previous 70mm presentations) specially installed for this film. The Music Box is also installing a new 7.1 channel sound system for the occasion. In other words, this is the Chicago theater where you want to see this movie.</p>

<h3>Concussion</h3>
<p>A feature film that examines the very serious issue of the long-term dangers of repeated head trauma in sports (especially football) seems like it's long overdue, even though the condition has only really been in the public eye for less than 15 years. When high-profile former players suffering from extreme brain dysfunction started killing themselves in relatively large number by shooting themselves in the heart so that their brains might be used for research purposes, the National Football League had an impossible time keeping the research quiet about the condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) ...not that it didn't try.</p>

<p>According to the new film <em>Concussion</em>, Pittsburgh-based, Nigerian-born forensic neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (played with a dignified strength by Will Smith) accidentally discovered the condition in football players (decades-old studies existed about CTE in boxers) when former Steeler Mike Webster (David Morse) died, raving about hearing voices, having paralyzing headaches and experiencing delusions. Omalu is established early on as a coroner who takes an nontraditional approach to autopsies &mdash; he talks to the corpse, as if coaxing the cause of death from it rather than simply tearing into the body for answers. Expecting to find the damaged brain of a crazy person in Webster, the doctor finds nothing noticeable to the naked eye, and he orders a more detailed brain analysis that reveals what would eventually be called CTE.</p>

<p>Omalu's pronouncement of his findings and declaration that Webster died from playing football sends minor shockwaves through both the Pittsburgh sports world and the NFL, causing both to act defensively and attempt to discredit the highly educated pathologist. As strange is it sounds, Omalu's research is sound enough that he doesn't have much trouble convincing any medical professional not working for the NFL that CTE is a real threat. His boss (Albert Brooks) and noted medical researcher and Alzheimer's expert Dr. Steven DeKosky (Eddie Marsan) are among early converts to his findings. </p>

<p>Unexpectedly, also in his corner is the Steelers' former team doctor Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin), who saw symptoms of this condition when he worked for the team, and he tells Omalu about research conducted by the NFL to examine the effects of concussions on players &mdash; shockingly, the league (officially) found no connections to any long-term medical issues.</p>

<p><em>Concussion</em> attempts to establish itself as a thriller of sorts, but other than a few vaguely threatening phone calls to the doctor's house and a free-floating sense of paranoia by the doctor and his new wife, Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw from last year's <em>Belle</em> and <em>Beyond the Lights</em>), there's nothing really to substantiate the amped-up sense that they are in any real danger, beyond the doctor having his reputation attacked by medical professionals working for or hired by the NFL. Writer-director Peter Landesman (<em>Parkland</em>) also wrote last year's grossly overlooked <em>Kill the Messenger</em>, which did a far better job at capturing that feeling that someone is out to get you &mdash; probably because, in that film, someone was.</p>

<p>Some of the supporting players in <em>Concussion</em> are quite nicely drawn, including Luke Wilson as NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who calls for a special committee on players' health and then soundly rejects any idea that brain injuries result from repeated blows to the head. I also liked the rather brutal portrayal of former Chicago Bears player Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who has a great role in the recent release <em>Trumbo</em>, as well), who went from player to management and was forced to ignore the concerns of fellow former players about their symptoms.</p>

<p>I'm always up for a good David vs. Goliath story, but <em>Concussion</em> is missing something vital, something that fills us with a sense of good and proper outrage. I've heard stories about the distributor being concerned about placing the full blame of how bad this epidemic became on the NFL, but that's exactly what this movie should do to give us a focal point for our frustration and anger. The movie takes its medical science and public health messages seriously (bludgeoning us with them at times), but it couches them in this story of corporate intrigue and public demand for an even more violent level of football, including in games played by kids (a scene in which Omalu pulls his car over to watch a high school football game seems a little bit too on the nose).</p>

<p>Based on Jeanne Marie Laskas's GQ article "<a href="http://www.gq.com/story/nfl-players-brain-dementia-study-memory-concussions" target="_blank">Game Brain</a>," <em>Concussion</em> is a closer call than you might think, but it still ends up feel like artificial drama and preachy dialogue built up around an incredibly serious subject. Throw in a troubled pregnancy for Prema, and you've got yourself a based-on-a-true-story movie that feels like selective and false memories, which is a shame because I'm guessing something closer to the truth would still be far more interesting, informative and human. </p>

<h3>Joy</h3>
<p>The men and women in David O. Russell's films are often damaged goods from way back. They all have their reasons for having major personality defects, but there's no getting around the fact that most of us would have a hard time dealing with them in the real world. But Joy Mangano (a real-life and highly successful inventor/entrepreneur), the subject of Russell's latest work <em>Joy</em>, doesn't quite fall into that category. Her greatest shortcoming is her family, but to be fair, their appallingly bad advice and unconditional lack of support of and confidence in her (crossing into outright betrayal, at times) is what likely drove her to succeed. Joy (played with just the right levels of exasperation and charm by Jennifer Lawrence) is someone we might call "too good" &mdash; too forgiving, too ready to give those who would allow her to fall flat on her face a second or third chance, and it makes her absolutely frustrating and fascinating all at once.</p>

<p>Ironically, one of the most supportive people of her dreams and goals to better herself is her ex-husband Tony (Édgar Ramírez). More than once, they make the observation that they are far better at being friends than they were at being husband and wife, which is handy when Joy needs him to help out with their three young kids while she deals with the mess that is her life. Joy shares a home with Tony (who lives in the basement), their kids, her mother Carrie (who almost never leaves her bed and is addicted to soap operas, played by an almost unrecognizable Virginia Madsen), and loving grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), so it's no surprise that their Long Island home feels claustrophobic. Things are not made better when her freeloading father Rudy (Lawrence's <em>Silver Linings Playbook</em> and <em>American Hustle</em> co-star Robert De Niro) shows up and must share the basement with Tony. Bonus points: the two men hate each other.</p>

<p>In flashbacks, we learn that, since Joy was a child, she was always coming up with inventions, one of which was a fluorescent flea collar that also kept dogs from choking on their leash. She swears that Hartz stole the idea, and her interest in inventing waned. But one night when she is mopping up a broken glass, she cuts her hands trying to wring out the mop and comes up with the idea of a mop offering hand-free wringing that also is infinitely more absorbent and has a cotton-made head you can throw in the washing machine, making it the only mop anyone would ever have to buy. As difficult as it is to believe, <em>Joy</em> will make you care about the fate of this Miracle Mop and its creator more than just about any other character or inanimate object you'll see in any movie this year.</p>

<p>The film tracks the slow and painful process of getting a prototype of the mop made, securing a patent, getting financing for the business, finding a small assembly plant to mass produce them affordably, and figuring out exactly how and where to market and sell them. None of these steps comes easy to Joy, and her family fights and contradicts her every step of the way, including her envious sister Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm), whose belief that she has better ideas than Joy makes her think it's okay to sabotage Joy's business. One of the most horrible creatures in the film is Rudy's new girlfriend, played by Isabella Rossellini, a rich widow who puts in a the seed money for Joy's business, but insists on hiring a lawyer to take care of her patent, who in turn screws them up and puts Joy is a position where she might lose everything.</p>

<p>There are more than a few moments where you truly wish Joy would abandon her family wholesale, take her kids and go hide out until these jackals disappear, but she's not built that way and somehow has the strength to use their derision to fuel her drive and keep her eye on the prize. And apparently, the prize is QVC, which is where Joy found her early success, in the cable channel's early days. As good as the first part of <em>Joy</em> is, the scene in which she enters the QVC studios and gets her first crack at selling the Miracle Mop is the dramatic turning point in the film. She (and we) can see the prize, and the fact that it still seems so close but so out of reach will make your head spin.</p>

<p>She's given a tour of the QVC studios by an executive for the company (played with just the right blend of soothing guru and sleazy corporate goon by another frequent Lawrence co-star, Bradley Cooper), and he makes big promises about exposure and sales. (Keep an eye out for a wonderful cameo by early QVC celebrity salesperson Joan Rivers, played by her daughter Melissa.) After the mop makes a botched first appearance on the channel (hosted by a "professional" host who never bothered to test the product first), Joy convinces QVC to allow her to host her own segment, and the resulting segment nearly brought me to tears when it was over, for so many reasons &mdash; the first of which is that it's one of the few times where something goes right for Joy. It's the emotional highlight of <em>Joy</em>, and I love when a film manages to surprise me so completely and unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Sadly for Joy, this victory is fleeting, and the remainder of the film involves more fighting on her part for what is right and what is hers, both against her family and outside forces that threaten the production and ownership of the Miracle Mop. Even in victory, she isn't allowed complete peace or piece of mind. There are a few final moments in <em>Joy</em> that are set closer to the present day (most of the film is set ind the early 1990s), and it's clear that the lessons she learned about being allies in business have isolated her and made her less trusting. At the same time, she's protective of others who come to her with great ideas to make certain they have their patents and designs in order, so no one can steal from them.</p>

<p>Russell never allows any of his characters to have it easy in any of his works; let's face it, they would be fairly dull films if he did. His screenplay (from a story idea credited to him and Oscar-nominated <em>Bridesmaids</em> screenwriter Annie Mumolo) is said to be partly fiction, maybe more so than the typical biopic. But the one thing I'm convinced of is that Lawrence captures the everywoman quality that Mangano brought to a network whose on-screen faces were empty-headed celebrities, spokesmodels, and camera-ready hosts (sorry, Joan). Joy was also the type of person who might leave a particularly nasty family exchange, go fire off a couple rounds at a nearby shooting range to blow off some steam, and get right back to the task at hand. Welcome to America, folks.</p>

<p>Russell and Lawrence are a remarkable team who seem to bring out the best in each other, without ever getting overly sentimental or ridiculous (even the portrayals of Joy's extended Italian-American family are mild). I've seen <em>Joy</em> described as a "comedy," which may be a way of conveying that the folks using that word don't think it's possible that the subject could be at the center of anything but. But this film is both a family drama and a character study of people we rarely get to see on the big screen, and that might be its greatest accomplishment of all.</p>

<h3>Carol</h3>
<p>There's a scene in the new Todd Haynes's film <em>Carol</em> that we actually get to see twice &mdash; once to open the movie and once very close to the end. It's a scene of two women in a quiet restaurant, eventually interrupted by a friend of one of the younger of two, who has no idea what exactly he's interrupting, but he's on his way to a party and wants his friend to join him, which she does. The first time we see the sequence, we're scrambling in our heads to figure out what we're seeing. Both women look anxious (as in, full of anxiety), and this is clearly a big moment for both of them. I was even fairly certain that there was a shift in the dynamic of their relationship happening before our eyes, but it's not exactly how that shift is materializing. It isn't until we see the scene again, in its proper context, that we understand just how drastic the transition of power between them is. It seems like a simple choice in the editing, but the result is powerfully dramatic and emotionally riveting.</p>

<p>The setting of <em>Carol</em> is 1950s New York City, as we meet 20-something department-store clerk Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), who is dating Richard (Jake Lacy of <em>Obvious Child</em>) but seems somewhat hesitant to get serious enough to marry him &mdash; a source of constant frustration for the young man. Her indecision could easily be chalked up to her youth and wanting a different life than the one marrying this man would oblige her to. Then one day at work, Therese meets an elegant older woman named Carol (Cate Blanchett), who seems right out of a women's magazine filled with idealized images of the perfect big-city wife, combining a camera-ready style and fashion sense with a near-royal persona. Therese is instantly drawn to Carol (although she probably isn't aware why at this point), and Carol damn well knows it, conveniently leaving behind a glove at the the girl's counter, giving her an excuse to deliver it to her home shortly after their first meeting.</p>

<p>The two are instantly drawn to each other, and soon we find out that Carol and her husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler) are on the verge of divorce, partly because Carol seem to prefer the company of women lately, including her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson), a similarly aged woman who seem more open about her companions than anyone else in the movie. The way people talk around what they're actually talking about in <em>Carol</em> is remarkable, and Phyllis Nagy's adaptation of Patricia (<em>The Talented Mr. Ripley</em>) Highsmith's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0486800296/?tag=gapebloc07-20" target="_blank"><em>The Price of Salt</em></a> does a beautiful job of capturing the specific language used at time to discuss the unspeakable. The way to deal with a problem in this era, apparently, was to never mention it.</p>

<p>The pacing of <em>Carol</em> and the way in which Haynes slowly reveals how desperate the title character's life has become as a result of wanting to leave her husband is the key to its dramatic success. There's a sense that she is throwing herself into this new would-be affair with Therese to escape, and eventually the two just pack up their bags and drive out of the city headed west (including an overnight stay at the Drake Hotel in Chicago). Along the way, Therese meets a handsome young man named Tommy (Cory Michael Smith, in a very different role than he plays as the future Riddler on "Gotham"), and we begin to suspect that Therese is still questioning the degrees of her sexual preferences. But that storyline takes a decidedly unexpected turn.</p>

<p>Nothing about <em>Carol</em> &mdash; from the acting to the costumes to the makeup decision &mdash; is an accident. Director Haynes (<em>Safe</em>, <em>Far From Heaven</em>, <em>I'm Not There</em>, HBO's <em>Mildred Pierce</em>) has practically color coded the film to give us cues about the nature and inner feelings of the characters, and it's a stellar manipulation that's easy to give into. Therese wears boxy, uncomfortable layers of clothes &mdash; something of a precursor to the beatnik look &mdash; while Carol is more about a flowing elegance that is really about playing a part. Even the film stock in <em>Carol</em> conveys a tone. The very first thing I noticed when I saw the movie was the hint of grain in the print that made the film feel lived in, classic, while still allowing the warm colors to pop. I've seen recent films shot in 35mm and never noticed grain in the finished movie, so I wasn't surprised to learn that Haynes and cinematographer Edward Lachman went with Super 16 stock.</p>

<p>The trip is clearly an escape, and a particularly poignant and beautifully shot love scene seals the deal that this is not strictly friendly cross-country drive. But it doesn't take long for reality to come crashing in on this new love, and before long Carol is forced to drag herself back to New York and her husband to face the very real possibility of completely losing custody of her children. Harge is so determined to retain the sanctity of the family that he doesn't care that his wife is a lesbian, as long as she puts on the appearance of being his devoted wife. Chandler's performance isn't being talked about much, but he's a fantastic blend of desperate and angry, which combines to make him strangely sympathetic.</p>

<p>In films like <em>Far From Heaven</em> and <em>Mildred Pierce</em>, Haynes has often centered on female characters who discover a hidden strength after a major, life-changing event, and <em>Carol</em> slips easily into that category. Mara's Therese is a young woman still figuring herself out, but fairly certain she's about to enter unchartered territory in her relatively sheltered life to date. But Blanchett is the truly transcendent performer here, as the title might suggest. She somehow manages to be as complete and fully drawn a characters as I've seen in a film all year, yet maintain a mysterious, impenetrable quality that leaves us wanting to know more about her. She pulls us into Carol's heart and mind, but leaves portions of herself only to herself. In all likelihood, you'll fall deeply in love with her as well. Considering Blanchett has literally never been bad in a film, she might top everything she's ever done with this role.</p>

<p><em>Carol</em> is about as perfect a movie as you're likely to see this year. The temptation is to say there isn't an agenda with the film, but the mere fact that Haynes has decided to tell this story now means something. The attitudes toward the central relationship make the film feel even more dated than it already is. As much as period clothing, cars, and music might inform us of the year a story takes place in a period film, the prejudices that prevail really do the heavy lifting and tell us exactly when we are with this story. It's as melancholy as it is hopeful; it's a magnificently lush visual piece that never lets us forget what's at stake for these two women. I can't wait to see this one again. <em>Carol</em> opens today in Chicago at the Landmark Century Center Cinema.</p>

<h3>Hitchcock/Truffaut</h3>
<p>Arguably one of the most important books about film in the last 100 years is François Truffaut's 1967 long-form interview with Alfred Hitchcock, <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>, in which the master and hero to many in the French New Wave at the time goes film by film with the French upstart in such a way that, at times, it feels like you're listening in a private conversation between two kindred spirits of great filmmaking and storytelling. It's a rare film interview book that is both inspirational and educational. Director Ken Jones (who has previously made the terrific docs <em>Val Lewton: The Man in the Shadows</em> and <em>A Letter to Elia</em> about Elia Kazan) has made a documentary by the same name that not only goes through the process that resulted in the book, but the impact the book has had on generations of future filmmakers who read it at critical times in their lives.</p>

<p>Currently director of programming of the New York Film Festival, Jones has been a longtime staple of the film community, has incredible access to a host of directors willing to speak at length about the significance of <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> as a guide to style and the visual language of film. Interviews with the likes of Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, Peter Bogdanovich, Olivier Assayas, James Gray, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Richard Linklater, Paul Schrader, and Arnaud Desplechin, are all enlightening, especially since many of these folks are as known for their knowledge of film history as they are for being great directors. The biggest surprise for me was listening to David Fincher absolutely geek out about the book as a key component of his filmmaker soul. Fincher isn't even a fan of talking about his own work, so to see him talk at length and so passionately about anything is a real treat.</p>

<p>But the most compelling element of <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> is going through the interview itself, with the help of the archival audio tapes and photos taken during the interview. One can't help but notice how loose and open Hitchcock becomes with Truffaut, revealing decisions and secrets that went into the making of some of his most beloved works. Jones opts to narrow his focus occasionally on a few choice works, like <em>Vertigo</em> and <em>Psycho</em>, as they were discussed during the original interview and with his esteemed panel of present-day experts.</p>

<p>It's easy to forget that Truffaut was only 30 years old when he did this interview, but by being a filmmaker as well (he was also a critic for a time), Hitchcock opens up to him in ways I don't think he would have in a more traditional promotional-style interview. Truffaut digs deep, and presents a frame-by-frame analysis of certain sequences. His eagerness to have all of his greatest questions answered is barely containable, and you can't fault him for it in the slightest.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the film, much like the book, is to remind us that there was a time when the word "auteur" was a good thing and not something to be feared in cinema. More importantly, <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> works as a gentle but necessary reminder that Hitchcock was and remains an absolute master, despite also being a filmmaker who was commercially successful and a pop culture icon. His works stand the test of time and are a constant source of inspiration for many of the directors whose works I most look forward to seeing year after year. The film isn't necessarily seeking to be a standard-issue lecture on the techniques of Hitchcock (although that's certainly a part of it); it works best as a refresher on what a complete craftsman he was in every aspect of his movies. For film buffs, this doc is required viewing. The film opens today in Chicago at the Music Box Theatre.</p>

<h3>Man Up</h3>
<p>When I first heard about the British romantic-comedy <em>Man Up</em>, starring Lake Bell (fresh off her impressive writing-directing debut <em>In a World...</em>) and Simon Pegg, I was justifiably excited about the idea of these two funny folks combining their talents and perhaps turning the run-of-the-mill rom-com into something subversive and grown-up, while still being funny. I was surprised and concerned when the film didn't get a mainstream release in the United States, but that didn't stop me from being quite eager to check it out. And as I watched it unfold before my eyes, my heart sank little by little over the course of its under-90-minute length.</p>

<p>If you put a gun to my head, I suppose the biggest difference between <em>Man Up</em> and every other rom-com is that Bell's Nancy is actually slightly more mentally unstable than your typical character in one of these films. Not only does she hijack another woman's blind date with Jack (Pegg), but she invents fiction after fiction about her fake self to such a degree that the person she's pretending to be is far more interesting and enjoyable than the real her. Nancy is a perpetually alone 34-year-old woman whose family is putting constant pressure on her to find the right man, and she sees qualities in Jack that her family might like. Their date goes rather well, although her wacky lies are neither clever nor funny, and he's walking around with his signed divorce papers in his man purse, so good times!</p>

<p>If anyone (and I include writer Tess Morris or director Ben Palmer, a veteran of British TV) had bothered to dial back the attempts at humor just a touch or done anything to make these two characters act remotely like real people, the film might have amounted to something genuinely charming. Instead, <em>Man Up</em> is one long example of people trying too hard to be entertaining rather than honest and human. Everybody is so "on" here that it becomes exhausting. There's a supporting part played by the great British theater actor Rory Kinnear (<em>The Imitation Game</em>, "Penny Dreadful") as a stalker-ish former school chum of Nancy's, whom she stumbles into on her date and threatens to blow her cover unless she performs a sex act on him. Classy, people, real classy. I don't think I've ever disliked a character played by this actor more, and the same goes for ones played by Olivia Willaims (as Jack's ex) and Ophelia Lovibond (as Jack's much younger intended blind date).</p>

<p>There are montages galore (set to pop songs, of course), lots of drinking, theories on relationships, sharing about how they thought love was supposed to work when they were younger, and of course, grand gestures made in front of large groups of strangers, which still passes for humor in certain circles apparently. I'll admit, I liked the idea of setting an actual unstable person at the center of one of these stories, and I thought that might be the film's twist. But, big shocker, <em>Man Up</em> doesn't commit to anything remotely that edgy, and by the end of the film, everything works out for everyone. The end. There's a lot of discussion about taking chances, being spontaneous and putting yourself out there, but this film does none of those things. It's limp as a source of laughs or emotions, and it reminds us why the rom-com is an endangered species on movie theaters right now. Until someone reinvents the formula, may it rest in piece. The film opens today in Chicago for a weeklong run at the Gene Siskel Film Center.</p>

<p><em>Dynamite Divas</em>, <a href="http://www.blackensembletheater.org/">Black Ensemble Theater</a>'s contribution to holiday celebrations, is subtitled "A Tribute to Women of Soul." And it's a worthy tribute to those talented and charismatic singers, with performances of songs of the '60s and '70s by Roberta Flack (Melanie McCullough), Nancy Wilson (Rhonda Preston), Gladys Knight (Rashada Dawan) and Aretha Franklin (Shari Addison). The four performers sing powerfully and create realistic personas of their characters. Their songs alone would have earned four stars for the musical aspect of this show.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that fine music is layered with a silly plotline about a billionaire inventor (Mr. Maurice, smarmily played by Rueben Echoles) and his worldwide telecast of the dynamite divas. Echoles, a multitalented artist, also directed, choreographed and designed costumes and wigs. The production, written and produced by BET's founder, Jackie Taylor, would be better off with less of Mr. Maurice and his story. </p>
        <p>The four divas arrive on the pretext of Mr. Maurice paying each a healthy fee to rehearse and appear on the telecast. Over the course of Mr. Maurice's "three stages," they exchange memories of their life journeys, hardships, loves gained and lost. Preston recreates Wilson's silky jazz stylings in "You Don't Know How Glad I Am," McCullough's Flack does a lovely rendition of "Killing Me Softly," and Dawan's Knight brings the audience "Letter Full of Tears." Addison's Franklin, the queen of soul, ends act one with powerful versions of "Freedom" and "Respect." </p>

<p><em>Dynamite Divas</em> features appearances (via Mr. Maurice's "Assimilator") by soul singers of the past such as Nina Simone (performing "Mississippi Goddam" and "Young, Gifted and Black"), Dinah Washington ("This Bitter Earth"), and film excerpts of sensational older divas. There's even a cameo by a Beyonce impersonator, asking "Why Not Me?"</p>

<p>The singers are backed up by an outstanding seven-member band, directed by musical director, arranger and drummer Robert Reddrick. The band is perched on a platform above the stage.</p>

<p>Originally staged by BET in 2001, the current version of <em>Divas</em> is updated to include some of today's divas and the use of electronic handheld devices by Mr. Maurice and his staff. Echoles has created spectacular evening gowns for all the divas and ensemble members. The sparkling stage set and lighting are designed by Denise Karczewski and enhanced by Aaron Quick's sound and projections design. </p>

<p><em>Dynamite Divas</em> runs about 2.5 hours with one intermission. It continues at the Black Ensemble Theater, 4450 N. Clark, through Jan.24. Performances are Thursday through Sunday with two shows on Saturday.

        <p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/domesticated.jpg" width="560" alt="Domesticated" /><br /><span class="s"><em>Mary Beth Fisher and Tom Irwin in Steppenwolf Theatre's</em> Domesticated.</span></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.steppenwolf.org/Plays-Events/productions/index.aspx?id=640">Domesticated</a></em> opens with an all-too-familiar press conference you've seen both on cable news and in TV dramas: a middle-aged politician apologizing (or trying to, anyway) for a sex scandal as his wife looks on. Can Steppenwolf's Bruce Norris, the Pulitzer-winning playwright of <em>Clybourne Park</em>, turn one of our oldest tropes into an edgy conversation starter?<br />
</p>
        <p>He certainly tries. The original production at the Lincoln Center in New York, featuring Jeff Goldblum as the philandering Bill Pulver and directed by current Steppenwolf artistic director, Anna Shapiro, opened to good reviews. But despite Norris's audacious structure and a trio of fiery performances from Tom Irwin, Mary Beth Fisher and Beth Lacke, Steppenwolf's <em>Domesticated</em> is often aimless and oblique.</p>

<p>Here's the setup. Bill has been cheating on his wife Judy for years with prostitutes barely older than their eldest daughter, but he's been able to keep it a secret. That is, until one of them winds up in a coma. What happened is unclear. Bill says she fell and hit her head on the hotel bedpost, but the victim's mother thinks Bill pushed her. An investigation is ongoing, Bill doesn't have a job any more, and his family has had enough.</p>

<p>Now for Norris's stylistic innovations. First, he attempts an avant-garde framing device between scenes, where the politician's adopted daughter, Cassidy (Emily Chang) projects a multimedia presentation about sexual dimorphism in the animal kingdom. It's supposed to be a funny, postmodern riff on human gender relations, but it comes off as a string of lazy metaphors.</p>

<p>Second, Norris structures the play so that the cheating politician--Bill Pulver--doesn't speak a single word until Act II (except for that opening press conference). It's a bold move, and it gives the production's talented female actors time to shine, but the script still manages to fail the Bechdel test: all the women ever talk about is Bill.</p>

<p>In fact, an alternative title for the play could well be <em>What We Talk About When We Talk About Bill</em>. Bruce Norris has always been a talky dialogue writer who enjoys monologues, but <em>Domesticated</em> is the most plotless play I've ever seen. Scenes do not move the story forward in any linear sense. Characters, including Bill himself, just continue to talk (and talk and talk) about Bill's off-screen behavior. There's far too much summary and allusion, far too little dramatization.</p>

<p>Ensemble member Tom Irwin's performance does manage to wrench some nuance out of the one-dimensional, misogynistic politician in the script. Mary Beth Fisher deserves all the attention she'll undoubtedly receive for her spirited turn as Bill's spurned wife Judy. The most lively performance, however--the sole character I actually enjoyed seeing on stage--is Beth Lacke as the Pulver family lawyer. Other supporting characters are purely archetypal, especially Bill's children: the insufferable teenage daughter and the silent/agentless adoptee from a foreign country.</p>

<p>Finally, the climactic arguments between Bill and Judy clearly meant to shock and provoke those "dinner table conversations" feel tired and predictable. I'm glad playwrights continue to combat outdated attitudes and gender roles through dramatized misogyny, but <em>Domesticated</em> too often feels like a conversation we've already had.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.steppenwolf.org/Plays-Events/productions/index.aspx?id=640">Domesticated</a></em> runs through Feb. 7 at the Steppenwolf Theatre (1650 N Halsted).

<p>A lot can be said about the current film culture's emphasis on leaning heavily into the realm of nostalgia &mdash; not story, not character development, but simply giving audiences flashes of what we're familiar with and allowing that to pass for something new. Say what you want about his take on the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise, but I was at least happy that, by creating a time travel understory, J.J. Abrams effectively let it be known that anything could happen from this point forward. The possibility of opening up entirely different paths for the crew of the Enterprise was there, even if that's not exactly how it panned out.</p>

<p>In this retro climate, it should come as no surprise that the year's biggest box office hit (and one of the biggest of all time) is <em>Jurassic World</em>, which is so devoted to the original film, <em>Jurassic Park</em>, that it effectively pretends that the two other sequels simply never happened. And perhaps you noticed that <em>Creed</em> is also doing very well with fans of the original <em>Rocky</em>. Hmm... </p>
        <p>Which brings us back to Abrams, who has always been devoted to recapturing the experience many of us used to have going to the movies in the 1980s, when you'd typically get a poster, one trailer, a couple TV commercials (none of which were available to watch repeatedly online, mind you) and little to no information about the film beyond the official synopsis. Abrams dares to ask us "Why do you want to know everything before you see the finished film?" A fair question, and he does everything in his power to suppress information leaks. Good for him. But even if you've sequestered yourself for the past few months from all manner of <em>Star Wars</em> details and images and are able to go into the seventh chapter, <em>The Force Awakens</em>, relatively untainted, it doesn't mean the final film is going to be a triumph. I'm guessing most devoted fans' worst nightmare isn't that the film is going to be bad, but that it's not going to be <em>great</em>.</p>

<p>Working from a script by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> has moments of greatness; it approaches greatness at times, but it is not a complete success, largely because it becomes a constant barrage of the familiar that goes well beyond simply having a few of the same characters from the original trilogy. I suppose that since the <em>Star Wars</em> films are technically a single story in serialized form, some will think it's okay for characters to still be dealing with the aftermath of the events of episodes IV, V and VI, even though this film takes places 30 years later. </p>

<p>But even outside of specific plot points, this new chapter is structured in such a way that so much of it feels like direct callbacks to specific scenes in Episode IV in particular. We're dealing with yet another planet/moon-sized battle station, with a single weak point; there's another desert planet open; a droid is entrusted with invaluable plans; familial links play a key part in the conflict; there's a brilliant, reckless pilot; a noble heroine; a masked villain dressed in black who reports to a deep-voiced higher power; a diminutive alien creature that has a special connection to the Force that it's willing to share with one of our new heroes; there's even another cantina scene. Make sure to let your eyes wander around the corners of the Millennium Falcon, and you'll see a few familiar objects. It's actually bizarre how little has changed in 30 years.</p>

<p>The more traditional Empire, despite being decimated in <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, has somehow reformed under the new name The First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (voiced by Andy Serkis) and his primary underlings: the power-mad General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson in full Hitler Youth mode) and the Sith-like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, especially effective here as the agent of the Dark Side who is still somewhat drawn by his roots in the the Light Side). I was especially drawn to this character's warped vision of the universe. He's a Vader wannabe, with a makeshift mask that he wears for no particular reason other than to give himself an artificial voice that kind of sounds Vaderish. If you examine his mask closely, you'll see it looks like it was slapped together with rivets and poor welding, as it should be. Ren has backstory that I'm not going to dive into, but it deepens his internal crisis in a very necessary and vital way.</p>

<p>I was surprised that the first human face we see in <em>The Force Awakens</em> belongs to Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a masterful pilot working for the Resistance who has a map that is said to be the key to finding the long-lost Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, who is absolutely in this film and in the trailer), who went into self-imposed exile after a group of young Jedi trainees was killed by a rogue student, an incident that scarred Luke deeply and drove him to drop out completely. Poe is captured by Ren, but is soon set free by a stormtrooper named Finn (John Boyega), who is appalled by the mass killings of innocents in the hunt by the Order for this map. Before Poe is initially captured, he deposits the map in his droid BB-8 ("voice consultant" credit is given to comedic actors Bill Hader and Ben Schwartz), whom he instructs to find his way to the Resistance. </p>

<p>Poe and Finn manage to escape in a TIE Fighter, but crash on the desert planet of Jakku and are separated, with Finn retreating to a nearby town where he meets a scrap dealer named Rey (newcomer Daisy Ridley), who is now in possession of BB-8. Without going into anymore detail, from this point forward in <em>The Force Awakens</em>, Finn and Rey essentially enter into an intergalactic road movie, getting to know each other, traveling to strange new worlds, and meeting all manner of interesting creatures, including Han Solo (Harrison Ford, slipping right back into it) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), who have returned to a life of smuggling and dirty deals after a falling out with Leia (Carrie Fisher) drove him away from working with the Resistance. But Solo eventually agrees to help the young pair deliver BB-8's map to the former princess.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, everything is building to big conflicts both in the air (the Resistance is attempting to destroy this new Starkiller Base using X-Wings) and on the ground (heroes both old and young clash with Kylo Ren, other First Order soldiers, stormtroopers, you name it). We get brief visits from old friends &mdash; R2-D2 and C-3PO show up briefly, feeling slightly wedged into the story &mdash; and new acquaintances, including the badass stormtrooper superior Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), who is only on screen a couple of times briefly, but makes an impression that leads me to believe we'll be seeing more of her in upcoming segments. I love that Phasma is at her angriest when she catches Finn without his helmet.</p>

<p>I was so impressed with the new performers in this film that I believe it wouldn't have been crazy to try and make <em>The Force Awakens</em> without any old characters on hand. I'm not saying that's a better idea, but Ridley, Boyega, Isaac and Driver are so good here, they could have carried a film on their own steam (with a little kick in the pants from John Williams' still-inspiring score). But of course, we need our old friends on hand to make the transition, to pass the torch onto the new generation. Ford is the primary member of the old guard on screen here, and he slips right back into Han Solo so easily, he really makes its seem like no time has passed at all. The hair is a little lighter and the wrinkles a bit deeper, but it's the same scoundrel who absolutely would have and does shoot first.</p>

<p>Also impressive is how Abrams' film doesn't really look like any other <em>Star Wars</em> film. While it has its glossy moments, most of <em>The Force Awakens</em> is told from the perspective of an outsider looking in. It's rougher around the edges, dustier, more banged up. The use of hand-held cameras at times adds an immediacy to the battle sequences and fight scenes. It feels more like real war. And I believe for the first time, we see a stormtrooper bleed after being shot by a blaster (no, not Finn). I love the Rey and Finn are so young that names like Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are almost mythological to them, and they aren't even sure these people are real. They are of a generation that was raised on tales of war and bravery and sacrifice. It's a adds a completely different tone to the storytelling, one that is, at once, lived in and like something born out of a book of legend.</p>

<p>The simple truth is that <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> has too many references &mdash; specific and big picture &mdash; to what came before for its own good. It doesn't kill what is so damn good about it, but it tarnishes it a bit, only because it isn't necessary. And after about a dozen of these in the first 30 minutes, I started to wince as they continued to roll in. I realize for some fans, there can never be enough, and for those of you who think that way, you'll be crying and shaking and visiting your therapists by the millions. That being said, it's still a terrific film that keeps things moving, forwards a story I'm still very much interesting in continuing, and sets up what could easily be an even better sequel in the hands of writer-director Rian Johnson. I'm rather desperate to see where this ship takes us.</p>

<h3>Sisters</h3>
<p>I know it seems unfathomable that you would see anything but the new <em>Star Wars</em> movie this weekend, but on the off chance that you didn't buy your tickets early enough, all the shows are sold out, and you are committed to seeing something new this weekend, the other big studio option is <em>Sisters</em>, the latest pairing from perpetual awards show hosts and former "Saturday Night Live" co-stars (as well as <em>Baby Mama</em> leads) Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Directed by Jason Moore (<em>Pitch Perfect</em>), this is the story two dysfunctional adult sisters, Maura (Poehler) and Kate Ellis (Fey), who discover that their parents (James Brolin and Dianne Wiest) are about to sell their childhood home in Florida and decide to throw one last bash, as they regularly did in high school.</p>

<p>As shocking as it might seem, apparently the Ellis sisters are the only ones from their high school who moved away, so when they send out invites to their "Ellis Island" party (that name seems so wrong for some reason), all of their old high school pals all still live close enough to make it. Of course, the more things change, the more they stay the same. While the lives of these once party-centric friends have slowed down considerably, once the party gets rolling, the old self-destructive behaviors come right back out, as one might expect. In fact, the screenplay from longtime SNL writer Paula Pell is about the dangers of nostalgia for bygone times (which seems appropriate this weekend especially) and reminds us that sometimes the past wasn't as much fun as we remember.</p>

<p>When we meet Maura, she's continuing a life of attempting to help others in the most misguided way possible as a nurse. When she was younger, her drive to be a caregiver meant that she always had to be the designated adult at her sister's parties, which meant she couldn't drink and had to make sure the house and those in it stayed more or less in one piece. Kate was the wild child, sleeping with a long list of boys and living only for the moment, a trend that continues into adulthood. She now has a college-age daughter (Madison Davenport) who can't stand her and is secretly spending the summer living with her Aunt Maura.</p>

<p>The excursion to Florida is just what the family needs. In a twist the girls didn't see coming, their parents have actually already sold the house and moved into a retirement community that seems to have rekindled their sex drive. So the house is mostly empty (except for their rooms, which they have been charged with cleaning out), and so naturally the party idea arises, only this time Kate agrees to be the sober one for the evening, and you can probably guess how that turns out.</p>

<p>Sisters is far more hit and miss as a comedy than you might expect. Making Poehler the square doesn't seem like much of a stretch from her days on "Parks and Recreation," and seeing Fey attempt to play and talk like a sex-crazed, irresponsible woman just stretches the limits of my imagination more than it's willing to go. She doesn't wear the tropes of that persona convincingly, which impacts the rest of the film. That's not to say that hearing her swear like a sailor isn't funny at times (this is, without a doubt, an R-rated movie).</p>

<p>Much of the funniest material comes from the film's long list of supporting players, most of whom are quite strong here, including Maya Rudolph, John Leguizamo, Bobby Moynihan, Kate McKinnon, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch and Samantha Bee. Fresh from his very funny work in <em>Trainwreck</em>, John Cena is also on hand as a drug dealer who Kate is undeniably attracted to despite his clear preference for freaky sex stuff. The wonderfully charming Ike Barinholtz ("The Mindy Project") is more or less the film's sole straight man, playing a friendly neighbor who Maura is nervously drawn to, so much so that she can barely put two words together to talk to him.</p>

<p>With all of these smart and funny people, <em>Sisters</em> resorts a bit too often to really obvious jokes and gross-out humor. Still, the very funny cast elevates the material and pushes it in directions that extract laughs where once they may not have existed. Also, Poehler and Fey have a partnership that is so strong, it would be funny during a plague. They have throwaway lines that are funnier than some of the more drawn-out, physical-comedy bits here, and I wish there had been more of that. </p>

<p>It's likely a foregone conclusion that many of the conflicts brought up during the film resolve themselves nice and tidy-like by the end, which is slightly annoying. But there's an underlying thread of regret and sadness that permeates a great deal of this movie that, believe it or not, makes it a much more enjoyable viewing experience overall. I'm more torn about <em>Sisters</em> than I'd hoped I'd be, but for the most part, I think there's more here to like than dismiss, so a mild recommendation, especially if you need a break from lightsabers and Wookiees.</p>

<h3>Flowers (Loreak)</h3>
<p>The first of many unusual things you'll notice about Spain's official submission for Foreign Language Film consideration is that it's not in Spanish. For reasons are never explained and don't really matter, <em>Flowers</em> is in the Basque language, spoken primarily in a small quadrant of Spain and even smaller piece of France, and while the area on display in this movie is quite lovely in a melancholy way, the choice of filming in a place where Basque is still spoken is a nice surprise, courtesy of directing team Jon Garaño and Jose Mari Goenaga (<em>For 80 Days</em>).</p>

<p>The film opens with Ane (Nagore Aranburu) in her doctor's office receiving word that she has prematurely hit menopause, which both shocks and saddens her. Upon returning home, she finds a lovely bouquet of flowers waiting for her, she things coming from her husband (Egoitz Lasa), whom she has not told about her diagnosis. But the flowers aren't from him, and a mystery begins in Ane's life. The film moves on to another family in the same area, where we meet Tere (Itziar Aizpuru), an elderly woman who wants her son Beñat (Josean Bengoetxea) and his wife Lourdes (Itziar Ituño) to have a child before she gets too old. Even more intriguing, a new bouquet arrives every week, with no note or sense of why they are coming. Ane's husband begins to get jealous, when he can pry himself away from the television, so Ane starts hiding the flowers and taking them to her office job for a construction company.</p>

<p>The way the film is cleverly constructed, the audience is the only possessor of the entire truth, and we soon find out that Beñat, who happens to be a crane operator at the same company where Ane works, is the one sending the flowers, and she only figures this out after a terrible roadside tragedy occurs, and the flowers stop coming as abruptly as they started. In the wake of this accident, the deeply mourning Tere awkwardly attempts to bond with the daughter-in-law Lourdes in ways they never did before, and it backfires to a degree that Lourdes insists they never speak again.</p>

<p>Ane is left mournful for a different reason. The fact that this relative stranger was so kind to her for no particular reason has opened her eyes to just how empty and painful her marriage has become, and she reconciles her brand of grieving by going to put flowers every so often on the spot in the road where Beñat accident occurred. It takes Beñat's widow and mother years to figure out just who this mysterious person is leaving arrangements, but they both set out to discover just who she is.</p>

<p><em>Flowers</em> is partly about the way we grieve, but it's more about the way we keep ourselves from grieving so we don't have to accept that a loss has occurred. But it's also about making connections with other human beings who are clearly in need. The filmmakers make the point that Beñat was not a particularly special man by showing us the jarringly bleak path his dead body takes after it's donated to science. Most of the characters are in desperate need of kindness in their lonely lives, but it really would have helped if the filmmakers had made it clearer why these people were so listless and abrasive in the first place.</p>

<p><em>Flowers</em> is a minor work that takes full advantage of the gloomy natural setting of its location. The performances are all quite good, with Aranburu being especially poignant as Ane, probably because she rises out of her funk and her bad marriage. The mystery of Beñat as a secret admirer is curious to because I'm fairly certain we're meant to assume that he was never going to do anything beyond flower giving, which makes him a bit of a coward, and the least interesting of all the characters (the fact that he's dead for most of the film probably contributes to that as well). Still, the film is a leisurely stroll through hard times for people who eventually find ways to improve their lives in small but meaningful ways. The film opens today in Chicago at the Music Box Theatre.</p>

<h3>Noma My Perfect Storm</h3>
<p>I'll admit, I don't track the world of high-end food and restaurants, which makes this essential documentary about the eatery known as Noma in Copenhagen no less interesting, since the venue has frequently and repeatedly been called the Best Restaurant in the World since 2010 &mdash; with a traumatic year off in 2013, when it was only No. 2, and this year, when it tumbled to No. 3 &mdash;  by San Pellegrino (for comparison's sake, Chicago's Alinea often ranks in the Top 10 of this Top 50 list). The fascinating journey of getting Noma off the ground and fine tuning its Nordic locavore cuisine is the subject of the documentary <em>Noma My Perfect Storm</em>, both about the reputation-building process for the restaurant and its chef, René Redzepi, who is shown as both a caring and nurturing craftsman and an occasional tyrant in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Chef Redzepi is great about discussing how his many failures early in creating Noma helped shape what they are today and how he and his partners came up with the idea of creating dishes made entirely of ingredients that are found in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Åland Islands, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland. Now just because the ingredients can be found in these places doesn't mean they were purchased there, a fascinating point of contention for some. Apparently, Noma would go broke trying to purchase only locally grown and harvested components to its dishes, and the local versions of these ingredients aren't always the best. The distinction is small but a great source of debate.</p>

<p>We get to see Redzepi at his lowest points, as he's contemplating losing a Michelin star one year, or dropping from the No. 1 spot for a year, or accidentally food poisoning dozens of patrons one day. But we also get to see him soar and celebrate being a trailblazer in the gastronomic arena, where he is considered the reigning king. We see him berate and belittle his underlings, but they seem to take the verbal beating and come back stronger and sharper and ready to celebrate by Redzepi's side when the honors and accolades return. Redzepi is as much a motivator as he is a dictator.</p>

<p>For someone who knows little about how these dishes are created and composed, the most hypnotic part of <em>Noma My Perfect Storm</em> is watching the intricate experimentation with subtle flavor variations. The cooking and plating of food seems like the easy part compared to the weeks Redzepi spends in his laboratory that resembles a kitchen. The access granted over three years to first-time director Pierre Deschamps (also a chef) is extraordinarily detail oriented, and through that he gives us the opportunity to understand a bit of the complex process involved in the search for perfection. It's an engaging doc for the foodie and non-foodie alike. The film opens today in Chicago for a weeklong run at the Gene Siskel Film Center.</p>

<p><a href="http://neofuturists.org/">The Neo-Futurists</a>, Chicago's acclaimed experimental theater group, closed out their second and final weekend of Best of 2015 shows on Sunday and they're getting ready for New Year's Eve with a special <a href="http://neofuturists.org/toomuchlight"><em>Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind</em></a> performance.</p>

<p>Their 27-year-running late night show, <em>Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind</em> is seemingly as relevant and cutting edge as ever. Several of their Best of 2015 performances sold out and last week it was announced that the Neo-Futurists' Neo-Access Program and Neo-Futurist Kitchen Festival would receive grant funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
        <p>The Neo-Access Program is a three-part initiative that includes:<br />
<ul><li><p>Providing more scholarships for artists of color</p></li><br />
	<li><p>A partnership with Victory Gardens Theater to increase theater opportunity and accessibility for individuals with disability</p></li><br />
	<li><p>A partnership with Alternatives, Inc to provide theater teachers for their Urban Arts Program</p></li></ul></p>

<p>The NEA funding will also support the Neo-Futurist Kitchen Festival, a micro-arts festival hosted in late July. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/neo-futurist-performance.jpg" width="560" alt="Neo-Futurists performance" /></p>

<p>If they didn't have enough upcoming programming, the Neo-Futurists are hosting a New Year's Eve <em>Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind</em> performance party. The event begins at 9:30pm (a pretty early hour for the historically late night show) and includes beer from Metropolitan Brewery and hors d'oeuvres. The performance begins at 11pm, pausing 10 minutes before midnight for a countdown, and finishing the last mini-plays in the early moments of 2016. The $50 ticket price includes a champagne toast. </p>

<p>For those who haven't attended a Neo-Futurist performance before, the show features 30 sketches and a lot of audience involvement. Sure to hit every emotional note, <em>Too Much Light</em> typically explores non-fictional elements of the performers' lives, current political and social issues, and recent news events. Sketches often rely on word play, physical humor, music, dance, light play, and sometimes small amounts of fire. The sketches are performed in an order determined by the shouts of the crowd, and therefore no two shows are entirely alike. </p>

<p><a href="http://neofuturists.org/events/newyears/">Tickets</a> to the New Year's Eve Performance should be purchased beforehand. The NeoFuturarium is located in Andersonville at 5153 N. Ashland Ave.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hubbardstreetdance.com">Hubbard Street Dance Chicago</a> presented a holiday treat this weekend with its Season 38 Winter Series, performed Thursday through Sunday.  </p>

<p>The show consisted of two world premieres and one US premiere, as well as a Hubbard Street favorite. </p>

<p>The show featured the US premiere of Crystal Pite's <em>Solo Echo</em>, created for Nederlands Dans Theater in 2012. The piece is inspired by Mark Strand's poem, <em>Lines for Winter</em>.</p>

<p>The piece "presents a man reckoning with himself at the end of his life," said Pite. "The character is echoed--copied, reiterated, by seven different dancers. He is portrayed through both male and female bodies, and through various physiques and strengths. Each performer is a distinct and nuanced version of the character, and the connections between them evoke a man coming to terms with himself."</p>
        <p>Pite's choreography is spellbinding. It runs the emotional gamut, and the dancers hit the mark.The entire piece is exceedingly expressive. The dancing is quick paced and captivating.The piece is expansive and intricate, yet accessible, danced before the backdrop of a steady snowfall. They danced with such awareness of each other, such tenderness and beauty.</p>

<p>At times both serious and playful, Pite puts up a mirror to life: the triumphs, the turmoil, the mundane, and the work of coming to terms with it all as the end closes in. This piece is stark and beautiful. Pite's ability to evoke complex emotions in such a beautiful way is incredible. </p>

<p><em>Solo Echo</em> was not only my favorite piece of the night, but perhaps my favorite piece of the year.</p>

<p>The show opened with <em>A Glimpse Inside a Shared Story</em>, a world premiere by choreographer Yin Yue performed by members of Hubbard Street 2, joining the main company for the series. Yue is the artistic director of Yun Yue Dance Company and was part of Hubbard Street's International Commissioning Project.</p>

<p>The choreography was athletic, exciting, fast-paced and unique, set to pulsating music. The partnering was especially enjoyable. Viewers get the feeling the dancers are melting into each other in a new and unusual way. It is visually delightful.</p>

<p>The piece felt that, instead of dancers moving to music, the music was infused with the movement in a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>The high energy of the piece started to falter in the second half. There was a pair of excellent solos, but the final minutes of the piece had less energy and movement. </p>

<p>The show continued with <em>Waxing Moon</em> by Robyn Mineko Williams, a former Hubbard Street dancer. The three-person piece is her fourth Hubbard Street work. </p>

<p>The choreography is innovative, purposeful, beautiful and elegant. The central figure contemplates his future with the help of two other figures. You feel the tension and dueling parts of self exhibited in this piece as movement mirrors internal battles and contemplations. The dancing is visceral and raw. </p>

<p>Jacqueline Burnett is captivating as one of the outside forces, both alone and when dancing in partnership. With her entrance, the dancing shifts to ethereal as she floats through the piece in grace and strength. </p>

<p><em>Out of Keeping</em> was choreographed by current Hubbard Street dancer Penny Saunders, in the night's second world premiere. The choreography felt somewhat disjointed and chaotic. The dancers, usually so in sync it seems as though they are telepathically connected, seemed a bit off. The piece did flow as one unit, but the movement and the music lacked cohesion.</p>

<p>As the piece went on, it found its stride, like a puzzle coming together. It broke into a series of duets, with the female duets the most dynamic element of the piece. While perhaps not particularly unique, the duets--especially the first--were beautiful, graceful and seamless. </p>

<p>The piece ended with the same feeling of disjointedness it had in the beginning, without a central theme or emotion to anchor itself around. However, given the talent of Hubbard Street's dancers, the piece was still enjoyable to watch.</p>

<p>"Two of my core missions as Hubbard Street's artistic director have been to bring the best choreography from the world's stages to our audiences and dancers here in Chicago," said Artistic Director Glenn Edgerton. "This Winter Series program is a great example, with two terrific contributions coming from longtime associates Penny Saunders and Robyn Mineko Williams, alongside a brilliant work created by a Canadian choreographer in the Netherlands and the exciting new voice of an artist who divides her time between New York City and Nanchang, China."</p>

<p>A music festival--or any concert, for that matter--is a conversation between the musicians on stage and the vast array of fans before them. But to this point, that conversation has really only been explored from the artists' perspective. There's a certain mystique that accompanies the art of live performance and garners the lion's share of critical attention, but much of that mystique stems from the electric energy generated by the crowd itself. <em>FESTIVAL</em>, a documentary produced and directed by <a href="http://www.northcoastfestival.com/">North Coast Music Festival</a> co-founder Mike Raspatello, delves into this side of the live music story and successfully captures the essence of the festival experience. I was fortunate enough to attend a pre-screening of the film at the <a href="http://www.thenew400.com/">New 400 Theaters</a> in Rogers Park, and it made a powerful impression.</p>
        <p>The film opens cold on Travis, a 24-year-old man in a wheelchair, reading a poem from his phone about the visceral effect of EDM on his body. In a number of ways, the opening scene sets the stage supremely for what follows. For one, <em>FESTIVAL</em> is, above all, a story about people, namely seven concertgoers who attended North Coast in 2013. Travis and his friends Austin and Jill are three of these seven, and their backgrounds are intensely compelling: Travis has been paralyzed after a botched surgery a decade previously, Austin has spent over three years in jail for dealing LSD, and Jill has suffered through heroin addiction before sobering up. Even more compelling is the fact that they are each able to talk about their dark pasts with such candor and matter-of-factness--but that, in part, speaks to the healing power of the music that brings them together with the thousands of other festival attendees. Travis, Austin, and Jill are full of life, they act wonderfully naturally throughout their North Coast experience despite the cameras (especially Travis, whose upbeat snark is a joy to behold), and they collectively represent the spirit of the film. Every moment when they're on screen is a highlight, particularly Jill's interaction with a man dressed as the green Power Ranger, an absurdity that she just accepts at face value because this is a festival and anything goes.</p>

<p>The other characters vary in their effectiveness at transmitting <em>FESTIVAL</em>'s message. Barbara, a Polish immigrant, is the definition of a free spirit, coming to the concert alone, receiving a flower bracelet, and befriending a random guy while chattering away in an accent that makes her all the more lovable. It's stunning, therefore, when we find out in the film's epilogue that she is now married with a child (and her out-of-concert screen presence isn't quite as radiant). Meanwhile, Tracy, a PLUR enthusiast who attends the festival with her boyfriend, serves as a quasi-narrator, hammering home a number of global statements that give her a sort of omniscience that makes up for her lack of memorable in-concert moments. Really the only character who feel out of place is Kenneth, aka "Cobweb." His encyclopedic knowledge of hip hop doesn't really contribute to the story, and his time at the festival is spent almost entirely in a tent conversing with a rapper--it doesn't seem like he's there at all. There's also another young woman featured in this version of the film who just isn't terribly interesting, either in her background or in her festival experience. According to Raspatello, though, she has withdrawn her participation in the project and won't appear in the final cut. Here's hoping that her vacated screen time will be spent on Travis, Austin, and Jill.</p>

<p>Weaving in and out of the narrative of <em>FESTIVAL</em>'s main subjects is an oral history of the music festival itself, as told by three industry experts: Rolling Stone's Steve Knopper, Bonnaroo founder Rick Farman, and Jeff Shaw, Live Nation's Senior Vice President of Strategic Alliances. Together, they tackle everything from the origins of the festival and its revival after the failure of Woodstock '99 to the rise of EDM as a dominant force on the scene. Simultaneously witty and informative, the experts put the characters' experiences into context and remain interesting throughout the film. At times, the integration of the exposition segments with the in-concert footage feels a bit choppy--transitions, on the whole, are a weak point of <em>FESTIVAL</em>--but each individual scene is well-chosen, and when everything is cobbled together, the film's combination of armchair history and field research provides a neat look at the fans' side of the concert festival story.</p>

<p>If there's a singular reason to go see <em>FESTIVAL</em>, it's the footage gathered by Raspatello and his team at North Coast 2013. The subjects of the camera are clearly the fans and not the artists, with very little time devoted to the live sets and a correspondingly large swath of the film focused on the holistic experience: wandering through a crowd on the phone, making new friends, searching for water, having nonsensical, pointless conversations, standing with bobbing head as an electric beat racks the body. These are moments to which every music fan can relate, moments that will generate the same sort of "I've been there" response from general audiences that <em>This is Spïnal Tap</em> elicited from rock stars. </p>

<p><em>FESTIVAL</em> is choppy at times, and a few of its storylines are mundane, but isn't there always choppiness and mundanity at concert festival? With a little tweaking, this film could be a truly special, groundbreaking musical documentary.</p>

<p><em>*FESTIVAL is currently being re-cut and prepared for a spring 2016 film festival premiere, followed by wider release later in the year.</em></p>

<p>In many ways, this unbelievable story about a vengeful whale attacking a vessel designed to kill it belongs in the hands of a director like Ron Howard, who is a master at always finding the right tone for a story rather than imposing the same style in every movie he makes. I might even argue that if you didn't know you were watching a Ron Howard movie, you might never figure it out until the end credit begin to roll. I certainly don't mean to imply that Howard has no distinguishing characteristics as a director. Quite the opposite: his finest trait is that he doesn't smear his fingerprints across every film he makes, he lets the subject matter dictate every aspect of his movies, and he usually gets it right.</p>
        <p>With <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>, Howard tells the tale simply and quietly for most of the running time, because he knows every so often, there will be an explosion of violence either aimed at whales or caused by a rather large one. The film opens with a squirrelly young man named Herman Melville (a nice turn by Ben Whishaw) seeking out the last living survivor of the notorious Whaleship Essex, which in the winter of 1820 met an unlikely fate. The always-reliable Brendan Gleeson plays the former crewman, Thomas Nickerson, who was only a boy when the ship left New England, and after a bit of poking from his wife (Michelle Fairly), he breaks his long silence about the incident to Melville. Their conversation (which Howard cut back to every so often during the course of the film) feels more like a unburdening confession than simply storytelling, and Melville eats it up as he scribbles down notes with the desperation of a writer who senses he's about to be inspired to write something remarkable.</p>

<p>If you were to subscribe human traits to a whale (or any animal), it might be said that the massive white whale at the heart of this story was taking its revenge on the Essex for killing so many of its smaller brethren by smashing the ship to pieces in a series of calculated attacks. The screenplay by Charles Leavitt (based on the book by Nathaniel Philbrick) does a great job explaining the importance of the whale oil industry in the world and how powerful and ruthless the leaders of that industry could be (at this point in history, there were only rumors of oil found beneath the ground as well).</p>

<p>Before the whales even come into the pictures, another fiery battle is under way, between the newly appointed captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker of <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>) and his first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth), who had been promised the job of captain until nepotism intervened, allowing Pollard to take over. Needless to say, their leadership styles clash almost immediately, and Pollard makes a series of novice mistakes early on that prove to the crew just how green he is. Watching Hemsworth scale the masts of the Essex in a flash makes him seem like a period superhero. But when they come under attack by the whale, the two put aside their differences and attempt to save as many crew members as possible.</p>

<p>Left only with the far smaller boats used to row out to whales to hunt them, the surviving crew members continue to be attacked by the white whale in a relentless and exhausting pattern of abuse. Among the crew members are Cillian Murphy's Matthew Joy and the young Thomas, played by Tom Holland (soon to become our latest Spider-Man). The survivors do eventually find land on a small, empty island with very few resources, so they must set out again in hopes of being discovered. Some of the revelations Nickerson makes to Melville about what the crew had to do to survive probably wouldn't be fit for a PG-13 film, but Howard finds a gruesome-free manner to get the point across; needless to say, it's about the worst thing you can think of, but after months at sea, there was little choice.</p>

<p>As typically beefy and bulky as Hemsworth is at the start of <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>, he manages to push his performance away from larger than life and gives us Chase as a man possessed with his own type of revenge against the white whale. His eyes of full of rage and obsession, even if his body is a fraction of its former self due to starvation and fatigue. The film is a physically exhausting experience.</p>

<p>The final minutes of the story are a bit of a letdown, but compared to what comes before it, that's hardly surprising, nor does it destroy what is so good about the rest of the movie. The captures of the life of a whaler quite convincingly &mdash; the months of boredom when no whales are found, leading to desperation, and the sudden burst of frenzied activity when the creatures are spotted. Howard turns this singularly inexplicable incident into its own kind of fable, some that bear a striking resemblance to <em>Moby Dick</em>, and some that are uniquely emotionally devastating in a way only this specific story could be.</p>

<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>Around this time of year, I get a lot of people come up to me before of after screening to ask what they should look forward to as the holiday movies quickly approach us. Since I've seen a lot of the end-of-year offerings, I try to drop hints about two or three title to keep an eye out for that they might not be aware of, including this last-minute drop in from director Adam McKay (the <em>Anchorman</em> movies, <em>The Other Guys</em>, <em>Step Brothers</em>, <em>Talladega Nights</em>). In what I can only describe as a completely unexpected coincidence, nearly everyone I've told about this film has asked, "Is that the film from the guy who made <em>Moneyball</em>?" I'm not sure if they're asking about director Bennett Miller or writer Aaron Sorkin, but either way, the answer is an emphatic "No."</p>

<p>But in a strange way, I understand the confusion. Like Moneyball, <em>The Big Short</em> is a story about outsiders who become successful insiders by knowing how to read and play the numbers. Only instead of baseball, these men are betting in the mid-2000s that the credit and housing bubble was going to collapse in on itself. They stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars if the American economy fell apart in unprecedented ways, ways we're still recovering from in many places. In case you haven't figured it out, McKay is exploring a new type of filmmaking with this movie, not leaving comedy entirely behind but creating extraordinary levels of heightened drama about the deeply corrupt banking system. You've never seen anything pieced together quite like this one.</p>

<p>Our guide through the complicated and labyrinthian plot (from a screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph, based on the book by Michale Lewis) is investment guru Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling, in full slickster mode), who introduces us to Michael Burry (Christian Bale), a hermit of a man who just happens to a be a doctor and one of the most perceptive investment advisors on Wall Street. Burry is the one who figures out that the housing market in on the brink, and he pumps millions of his clients dollars into a type of fund that will capitalize on such a colossal failure. He's immediately perceived as crazy; the fact that he walks around the office barefoot, in shorts, cranking heavy metal music doesn't appear to contradict that diagnosis. </p>

<p>A select few other investors take note of what Burry is doing and follow his lead with their fingers crossed Mark Baum (Steve Carell, who is exceptional as the angriest investor you'll ever meet), and a pair of young bucks that include Finn Whitrock (a favorite on "American Horror Story"), who in turns must ask for help from retired investment whiz Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) to get their foot in the door of this opportunity. Got it? Me either, but you will.</p>

<p>McKay is smart enough to know that this overwhelming amount of data being thrown at his audience is too much to comprehend, let alone retain, so he finds clever ways to relay the information, such as cutting to Margot Robbie in a bubble bath drinking champagne as she explains some financial bullshit or another. I don't know how much more of the information sunk in as a result, but I like the method of delivery. But most of the time, it's Gosling who walks us through the details, in one of the single most charming performances of his career. But he makes it clear that he isn't necessarily a good guy in this story.</p>

<p>Going any deeper into the story seems unnecessary, but as a result of the investors poking around, doing their due diligence on this crazy scheme, a pattern of banking and oversight corruption is uncovered that is truly shocking. Other films have been made about the post-collapse bailout, but <em>The Big Short</em> is razor sharp, lazer hot and will violate every sense of right and wrong you hold dear. The film is designed to make you laugh, learn and get angrier as it progresses to a collapse we all know is coming. </p>

<p>And as this small handful of investors eagerly await their big payout, Rickert delivers a crucial and brilliant monologue reminding them that they need to temper their enthusiasm and remember that when this happens, people's lives will be devastating and ruined. (I urge you to seek out <em>99 Homes</em> from earlier this year to see a personal account of the consequences of the housing market imploding.)</p>

<p>With a supporting cast that includes Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, Max Greenfield and Karen Gillan, <em>The Big Short</em> will grab hold of your world, shake the hell out it, and put you back down in your seat pissed off, grieving for our nation, and wondering what the government or any regulatory agency is doing to make certain this never happens again. You won't like the answer to that question either. This is a powerful film that sneaks up on you and leaves you spent and wounded. You'll love the filmmakers for it, believe me.</p>

<h3>Macbeth</h3>
<p>This frustrating adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most famous works, <em>Macbeth</em> may go down in film history as a footnote attached to write-ups about star Michael Fassbender and director Justin Kurzel's next collaboration, the video game-turned-movie <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. As it stands, <em>Macbeth</em> is something of a well-staged, beautifully shot mess with whispered dialogue standing in for actual dramatic reading. The story of the man who would be the King of Scotland is one of the finest in history about ambition and paranoia poisoning the mind of a powerful man who is still grieving after losing his beloved son.</p>

<p>Hi wife, Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) is a frayed bundle of raw emotion, and she pushes her husband to suspect new potential rivals and dispose of them. Both in its depictions of the assassinations and the wartime sequences, Australian-born Kruzel (<em>The Snowtown Murders</em>) opts to go particularly brutal and bloody, all in glorious slow motion, so we don't miss a precious drop of blood exiting the body. The decisions of what to leave out, leave in and add to the original text are key to this telling. Actually shot in the misty Highlands of Scotland, the location seems to lend itself to the more ghostly, supernatural elements.</p>

<p>While the key performances &mdash; which also include Paddy Considine as Banquo, David Thewlis as the previous king, Duncan, and Sean Harris (most recently seen as the villain in the latest <em>Mission: Impossible</em> film) as Macduff &mdash; are all strong, there is something strangely distancing about the film overall. Since we never get a hint of what Macbeth was like before his mind snapped, we don't get to feel the great loss he suffers in the film's opening sequence. And while the same might be said for Cotillard's work, she somehow manages to inject more empathy and suffering into her character, and the result is maybe the best performance of Lady Macbeth I've ever seen.</p>

<p><em>Macbeth</em> is an ugly, aggressive story by nature, and Kruzel doesn't miss an opportunity to underscore that in scene after scene. Nearly every frame of the film is flush with tension and the threat of violence, characters are caked in blood or filth &mdash; usually both &mdash; with an alarming frequency. And Fassbender's delivery is sometimes so menacing as to be villainous (as opposed to just misunderstood and easily manipulated). This is a mixed bad of an interpretation, but when it comes to Shakespeare, I tend to value bold adaptations more than routine, faithful ones. The film opens today in Chicago at the Landmark Century Center Cinema.</p>

<h3>The Danish Girl</h3>
<p>Director Tom Hooper (<em>The King's Speech</em>, <em>That Damned United</em>, <em>Les Misérables</em> and HBO "John Adams" miniseries) gets a lot of grief, admittedly some of it warranted, but not all of it. And there's really no arguing that more often than not, he gets some of the best work out of the very talented actors he gets a chance to work with, some of whom go on to win Oscars. With this latest work, <em>The Danish Girl</em>, he's certainly keeping his cast members in the awards conversation as he tells the story of married couple and artists Einar and Gerda Wegener (last year's Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne and the busiest woman in film this year, Alicia Vikander), the former of which went on to become one of the first-ever recipients of gender reassignment surgery circa the 1920s.</p>

<p>Einar was the more famous and successful of the two, but Gerda was on the verge of a breakthrough in modern Copenhagen. The Wegeners were clearly a happy couple, very much in love, but, as portrayed in this film, anytime Einar was complimented on his more feminine features, he would blush but clearly take some pride in the recognition as well. When her female model fails to show up one day for posing, Gerda asks Einar to slip on some stockings and hold up a frock to the torso to pose, and something seems to click &mdash; a recognition, an acceptance, an awakening. And things are never quite the same in him again.</p>

<p>Einar decides he'd like to dress up in Gerda's clothes, wear make-up and even go out in public like this under the guise of Einar's cousin, Lili. And he pulls it off without being recognized, more or less. Gerda is supportive when she begins to realize that this is something more than just Einar playing dress-up, but when she catches Lili kissing another man, Henrik (Ben Whishaw), she draws a line that she must know will be crossed. Further complicating things is that Gerda's paintings of Lili are her breakthrough moment in the city's art world, and she's offered a show of her own, featuring nothing but Lili paintings. Her success is now tied to her husband's slowly but surely becoming a woman.</p>

<p>As an actor, Eddie Redmayne has grown on me over the years, and while he does make for a convincing and attractive women in <em>The Danish Girl</em>, he also wonderfully captures the feeling that must accompany the need to transition, that startling realization that you are in the wrong body and you're driven like an addiction to present yourself in a way that feels most natural. It's all there on Redmayne's angular face. Still, he's not the most interesting or emotionally charged character in this film, especially since once Einar makes his decision, he rarely looks back or acknowledges those he's leaving in his wake. Vikander's Gerda is the character with the most important story arc; she is torn between wanting this man she loves to be happy and losing him once he decides to take on the Lili identity permanently. Vikander's (also seen this year in <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Testament of Youth</em> and <em>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</em>) is the most fully realized character in this film, and it's through Gerda that we are able to enter this story and understand her struggle.</p>

<p>One interesting side story that becomes more important as the film goes on is Einar/Lili's recognition that he felt these feelings back in school when he was best friends with Hans Axgil, whom he tried to kill, with humiliating results. Gerda tracks down Hans (Matthias Schoenaerts, recently seen in <em>Far From the Madding Crowd</em>) in hopes of sparking some emotional trigger in Einar. And while their reunion is quite cordial, it doesn't have quite the desired impact, but it does strike up a friendship between Hans and Gerda that indicates she may have a way of buffering her loss. It doesn't turn out to be quite that simple, thank goodness, and I like the way screenwriter Lucinda Coxon (adapting the novel by David Ebershoff) doesn't make things easy for anyone. Everyone must suffer a little if they hope to come out the other side stronger and closer to their true self.</p>

<p><em>The Danish Girl</em> seems remarkably timed in terms of the world we live in today. Discussions about sexual identity and gender confirmation procedures are far more commonplace today but there's still something of a stigma attached. The story of Einar/Lili and Gerda reminds us that every shift in the world that reconfigures what is the norm can be hardest on those taking the greatest risks. When we get the portion of the film that deals with the actual surgery, I'll admit, my aversion to all thing surgical kicked in and my stomach jumped a few times, but that didn't stop me from really falling into this film and embracing it, even in those awkward moment when Redmayne is admiring himself in the mirror just a little too much. The film opens today in Chicago at the Landmark Century Center Cinema.</p>

<h3>Theeb</h3>
<p>To fully understand Jordan's submission for next year's Best Foreign Language Oscar, <em>Theeb</em>, you have to imagine a version of <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> in which Lawrence is a minor player, with one of the many locals featured in the background has been elevated to the lead character. Set in the early 1900s during the height of war in the Ottoman Empire, a young man named Hussein (Hussein Salameh Al-Sweilhiyeen) is effectively raising his younger brother Theeb (or "Wolf," Jacir Eid Al-Hwietat) in a Bedouin community in an extremely isolated area of the desert. But changes are coming in the form of a railway built by Ottoman troops, one which the Brits are especially upset by and would like to destroy.</p>

<p>A British officer (Jack Fox, son of the great actor James Fox) comes to their village to hire Hussein as a guide to a difficult-to-find well, found along an old pilgrim's path on the road to Mecca. Fearful of being alone, Theeb secretly follows the small party headed to the well, but they eventually spot him, and he becomes a part of their team. It isn't long before the group is attacked by various hostile groups, including revolutionaries who want to kill anyone associated with the British, as well as Ottoman mercenaries and bandits from their own Bedouin brotherhood. After one such particularly brutal attack, Theeb ends up being forced to join forces with one of his attackers (Hassan Mutlag Al-Maraiyeh) in order to survive, and he begins to understand that many of these Arab groups have many of the same goes in mind for the way they'd like to live.</p>

<p>A first feature for director Naji Abu Nowar, <em>Theeb</em> is a desperate, sometimes terrifying film about a boy using his instincts and training from this brother to survive all manner of attack and treachery. He makes it clear that the landscape as well as some dwelling within it are equally dangerous. The film is also quite specific about cultural practices, differences and similarities, and seems embittered about how little the occupying Brits know about Arab culture and rightfully so. The film was shot in super 16, and you can almost feel the grit on the film during some of the more perilous wind storms and brutal battles. Young Theeb is both an active participant in this cultural battle and a keen observer of behavior, knowing full well that if you act you belong somewhere, most people won't question you being where you don't belong.</p>

<p>Theeb moves along at a tight clip, and features a great deal of violent action that gives the work just enough of a modern, Western touch to keep everyone watching keenly interested in the proceedings. The young actor playing Theeb is so good, and he's required to carry a great deal of not just the film's running time, but the emotional weight, when he and his brother are separated. The film is ragged along its edges, but is beautifully shot (by cinematographer Wolfgang Thaler) and carefully drawn out of everyday existence in a harsh environment. It's unlike anything you're likely to catch this month and well worth seeking out. The film opens today in Chicago at the Music Box Theatre.</p>

<h3>Paradise Is There: A Memoir by Natalie Merchant</h3>
<p>In an interesting choice for a musician who has spent a career trying to make an album better than her first solo project in 1995, Natalie Merchant decided to re-record the songs of her debut record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UXLY2S/?tag=gapebloc07-20" target="_blank"><em>Tigerlily</em></a> using alternate arrangements and musicians, ones she says she might have used 20 years ago if she'd known anything about how a studio worked. <em>Tigerlily</em> went on to sell millions of copies and became a pillar of strength for those who hold it dear. An examination of both the original album's construction and the reworking of it that was released ecently under the name <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B013USK9TA/?tag=gapebloc07-20" target="_blank"><em>Paradise is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings</em></a> is the subject of this documentary, directed by Merchant, who treats the entire project like an intimate personal memoir.</p>

<p><em>Paradise Is There</em> (the film) dabbles a bit in Merchant's personal history and childhood growing up in western New York in an area of the country known as the Rust Belt (due to it once being a center of industry that now lies largely dormant) and into her early years as a singer, which led to her becoming the singer of 10,000 Maniacs through the 1980s until 1993, when Merchant left the group. It's one thing to listen to talking heads discuss a person's career, but to have these events presented first hand by the subject of the film makes an important and fascinating difference. Merchant doesn't hold back about the reasons for joining and leaving the band, and while it appears the split was relatively drama free, the upheaval to her personally was immense.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of the documentary is that, in addition to Merchant talking about the individual songs that make up <em>Tigerlily</em>, she also interviews fans of the album or particular songs, all of whom have such intensely personal connections to her music that you feel like you're hearing the private thoughts of a few of these folks. There's a surprisingly amount of footage of Merchant and her group of players making <em>Tigerlily</em>, and they make it seems like it was just about the most casual process ever invented. We don't get as much about the recording of the new album, but we do get largely complete live performances of nearly all the songs on the album, including lovely versions of "Carnival," "Wonder," "Jealousy" and "Beloved Wife." Before each song, Merchant goes into a bit about the inspiration for the original track, and it's clear that there are no throwaway songs in this collection. Merchant feels every note, even today, and it's unmistakeable how much rediscovering them has meant to her.</p>

<p>Is there a degree of self-seriousness to Merchant laying out each song? Oh, absolutely. But eventually you just understand that she doesn't know how to be any other way. I'd rather have an artist care too much than not enough. She directed the film herself (a copy of which is included when you buy the re-recorded album), so what do you honestly expect? As a fan of music documentaries in general, when I watch one about an artist or album I don't know much about, I need the film to convince me the music/performer is worth building a doc around. In the case of Merchant and this album, it's clear that <em>Tigerlily</em> touched so many lives by zeroing in on the emotional components of life and hurt and love. It's an impressive presentation of new and old material, and it seems I need to invest in one or two new albums very soon.</p>

<p>The film will play in Chicago at the <a href="http://www.siskelfilmcenter.org/paradiseisthere" target="_blank">Gene Siskel Film Center</a> on Saturday, Dec. 12, 8pm; Friday, Dec. 18 at 8:15pm; Monday, Dec. 21 at 8pm; Wednesday, Dec. 23 at 8pm; and Saturday, Dec. 26 at 6:30pm. On Saturday, Dec. 12 at the 8pm screening, Natalie Merchant will be present for audience discussion. Attendees will be eligible to win signed posters and DVDs.</p>

        <blockquote><p><em>"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you"</em> -- Maya Angelou </p></blockquote>

<p>Exposing truth, sharing untold stories, and releasing traumatic adversity can serve as a mental and emotional cleansing. In <a href="http://www.cdpeterson.com/GalleryMain.asp?GalleryID=146528&AKey=SWEBNRTZ">The Cairn Project</a>, by <a href="http://www.cdpeterson.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=25271&AKey=SWEBNRTZ">Corinne Peterson</a>, participants from the Chicago area are invited to join in workshops where they handle clay and porcelain, and share their trauma in order to see their light. Individuals are instructed to create a "rock" from clay to represent their inner darkness or trauma, and then create a small token of light, which is made from porcelain. Once the workshop is finished, Peterson displays a mound from the clay "rocks" and installs the porcelain tokens as a cloud of hope above the cairn. </p>

<p>Currently at the Lillstreet Art Center, Peterson's exhibition, <a href="http://lillstreetgallery.com/cairn-cloud-a-collective-expression-of-trauma-and-hope/">"Cairn & Cloud: A Collective Expression of Trauma and Hope"</a>,  was created with participants from 60+ workshops and includes various clay sculptures which entice meditation and reflection. </p>

<p>I sat down with the artist on two of her meditation seats in the exhibition space and discussed the ideas behind The Cairn Project and the universality of trauma and hope. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://gapersblock.com/ac/00/Image-1-Corinne-Peterson.jpg" width="560" /><br /><span class="s"><em>Installation View, Zhou B Art Center, courtesy of the artist</em></span></p>
        <p><strong>Can you talk to me a little bit about the Cairn Project?</strong></p>

<p>It's an installation of work done by people taking workshops. In the "making" and in the "exhibiting," it's meant to help people relate to their compassion and their suffering. We all suffer, we all hope, we all have had some type of trauma in our experiences. We all have that indestructible core and the light within us. </p>

<p><strong>Are the same clay pieces included in every exhibition? </strong></p>

<p>Each exhibition has everything that was in the previous one plus whatever has been made in a workshop since then. This has at least 100 more rocks than the previous exhibition did. It's about 300 people that I've had workshops with at this point. </p>

<p><strong>Can you talk about the particular groups that you work with in the workshops?</strong></p>

<p>It's lots of different groups. The very first one was with a group of friends. It was a pilot workshop to see whether what I had put together was something that people would want to do. I had the idea of doing the cairn where people would be making a rock form that expressed their suffering. I thought to myself, "Who's going to want to take a workshop like that?" I didn't know if people wanted to do that. </p>

<p>I thought about the cloud part, the tokens of light, as showing why this could be a good experience because people are bringing their light and their compassion to it. The workshop with my friends was a profound experience. All of us have had some kind of trauma. I think a kid doesn't grow up in the culture to be taught to not feel what they feel, or express what they really feel. Since then I've done the workshops with blind and visually impaired, a group called NAMI, which is composed and run by people who have mental illness, Mexican immigrants, Iraq refugees, Burmese refugees, Burundi refugees, nurses, two sibling support groups for kids whose sibling was sick with cancer, and another for kids who had actually lost a sibling.</p>

<p><strong>What is the feedback like for the workshops? </strong></p>

<p>Thankfully I get a lot of feedback because I have a response form so I have a long list of their comments. The bereavement group had a lot of positive feedback. They commented on the safe place, the quiet, the calm, the sensitivity of the workshop. I did one workshop with 27 transgendered youth. We divided into three groups. Many of them commented on how great it was to not have to talk and to be quiet. In each workshop, when they are making the rock form about their trauma, or making the porcelain token of hope, we introduce it with a guided meditation and ask them to not talk with each other. I'm encouraging them to have an inner conversation. For the transgendered group, it was a relief for them. They were ages 12-20. This was a good thing for them. </p>

<p><strong>Where did the original idea for this project come from? </strong></p>

<p>Several different things came together to give me this idea. I was a psychotherapist and a social worker before I began creating art. I had dreams about clay and I was in the midst of my own Jungian analysis. It was a way for me to heal some of my trauma and discover what it was. It was an extremely informative and healing experience for me. In the last 2-3 years, I've been especially interested in reading about how trauma affects the brain and causes it to split and also how meditation is a means of healing. There is so much research now about how the brain can change and what you can do to it to change it, for the better. I had been actively meditating and reading about all of this. </p>

<p>Then I went on a trip to Sweden and Norway where I was going to visit different places that had ancient standing stones because they were an influence on my making sculpture. When I was there I saw a lot of different kinds of tombs and among them was this huge cairn, 5,000 years old, that for centuries had been used as a burial cairn. That was pretty impressive. After I came back to the US, I realized that I didn't want to make any artwork that wasn't fueled by my authentic self. I didn't want to thoughtlessly continue with what I had been doing. I had an <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130318/andersonville/swedish-american-museum-presents-entangled-routes">exhibition</a> between me and my kids and I thought, "Now what?" </p>

<p>I started to make small stones. I made 36 stones and I made them because I had a dream that I was putting them up on a wall, arranging them in a grid. I thought, "I don't know what this dream is about, but I should make them." As I worked on them it seemed like alchemy, like they were the nigredo, the dark matter. Each one represented some experience of suffering. I had a realization that to work authentically was to look honestly at your experience in a deep way. Then, I was in the Accelerator ArtSpace at the Elmhurst Art Museum and they have a real accelerator from the atom-splitting days at the University of Chicago and I thought, "I should have a show here because all of my work is about splitting and healing." I thought of the cairn I saw in Sweden and the pieces that I had made. So I thought, "I could make a cairn." I almost immediately thought about how I could incorporate my own social work self together with my art self and hold workshops and invite people to make pieces for this. I thought, "I have to do this." And I did. That was in February and my mind was on steroids all spring. In June, I had the first workshop. </p>

<p><strong>When did you decide you wanted an aspect of hope with the cairn?</strong></p>

<p>Almost immediately. Definitely in meditation which I was involved in, there is the idea of equanimity where you're aware of all of the raw things in life. </p>

<p><strong>Hope and trauma are both always together and present. </strong></p>

<p>Exactly. This was bringing compassion and light to the trauma experience. We have within us the ability to bring comfort to ourselves. In the workshops, the other people in the group don't necessarily know anything about what your story is. Everyone is invited to share their story but nobody has to say anything if they don't want to. The group where people shared the most deeply and most freely was with the Iraqi refugees. The pieces that they were making were very much about their deepest traumas. They started talking to each other about what they were making, like the cave they had hid in, or being at the top of the mountain and leaving behind their home. They all talked and it became a really free conversation. </p>

<p><strong>What have you gotten out of the entire project? Hearing all of these people's stories and talking to all kinds of groups that you might not normally be around must really have an impact on you. How has it affected your practice? </strong></p>

<p>Right, right. First of all, I would say that my default way of being, the way I grew up, was to dissociate away from my feelings. This project is a big opportunity to not do that. Every time I get ready for a group, or I'm meeting with a group, it's pointless if I'm dissociated from myself. I have to call myself back and be present. It's been a stretching process for me. Whenever you think about a group, you think about a particular kind of experience they have had. It makes me think more deeply about experiences. </p>

<p>When I did the workshop for the blind, I had to think about how we would adjust the workshop. At first, I could only think about the limitation of not being able to show them things. Then I thought, their hearing and their tactile sense is stronger than mine. It was terrific. I want to help people recognize that stones are like a metaphor for life, there is no such thing as a stone that isn't formed or changed apart from trauma. At the beginning of the workshop, people choose a stone and they use it to introduce themselves. For the blind group, that was a very tactile connection with the project from the start. The other overwhelming thing is that I have an expanded sense of human suffering and of hope. </p>

<p><strong>Could you talk a little bit about your idea of "splitting." You briefly mentioned it before but I would like to hear the background a little more in depth. </strong></p>

<p>It's very much about the kind of amazing experience of not having any feeling and knowing that you have a feeling about it. For me, sometimes it's like being on the outside of myself and looking in on myself where the real life is -- I'm kind of separated. I first became aware of this years and years ago when it was Christmas. I had three wonderful kids and I realized I felt no excitement about anything. It's like a depression. </p>

<p><strong>...like a numbness. </strong></p>

<p>Yeah, yeah. I think it's pretty common in one way or another for people. It's become more and more of a mission for myself to be fully connected. I'm always afraid to be open. When I first started doing art I became connected to the part of me that I was in therapy about. I was able to put what I feel inside into a concrete form. I realized that even though I was experiencing the split, there was a united base. </p>

<p><strong>What is the future of this project? </strong></p>

<p>In reality, it's open ended right now. The plan is that I'm carrying this though 2016 and the plan is to end with a two-month exhibition at Citlalin Gallery. It's a large space and I like the feel of it. They have a whole extra room so the thought is to accompany it with other events -- dance, poetry readings, some people's responses to the work. I want to find a permanent place for the cairn to be exhibited. Some place that is related to trauma, whether it's a hospital, or a school of some sort. I may have more exhibitions. Sarah Gottlieb has <a href="https://vimeo.com/112508130">BodyCompass Dance Project</a>, who specifically focus on the body, and the memory of trauma, and respond to that. They have accompanied the project at every exhibition. They would certainly accompany the final exhibition next year. My friend <a href="http://ginnysykes.com/home.html">Ginny Sykes</a> is probably going to join in with some of her work and she may develop a performance for it. We may have a call for dancers and try to get short pieces from a variety of different artists involved during the opening night. </p>

<p><em><a href="http://palaceoftheoccult.com">Palace of the Occult</a></em> takes place at a 1933 Berlin society gathering and tells the story of the popular psychic, Erik Jan Hanussen, who later became Adolf Hitler's psychic adviser. The production is based on the life of an obscure <a href="http://www.salon.com/2002/02/27/hanussen/">character</a> who may have played a significant role in World War II. </p>

<p>Neil Tobin, a Chicago performer, magician and psychic, wrote and performs <em>Palace of the Occult</em>, which takes place at the opening of the venue. He presides as Hanussen, the Jewish clairvoyant whose prophecies of victory gave Hitler confidence in his war strategy. Hanussen tells stories and performs magic and psychic demonstrations, some of which involve audience interaction. Jack Dryden, Carter Petray and David Weiner play other roles. </p>
        <p>Tobin was magic consultant for <em>The Addams Family</em> and <em>Barnum</em>, both at the Mercury Theater. He performed as the necromancer in the solo show <em>Supernatural Chicago</em>, which he presented weekly at the Excalibur nightclub for 10 years.</p>

<p>David Belew directs the production, presented by <a href="http://www.eclectic-theatre.com/">Eclectic Full Contact Theatre</a> at Prop Thtr, 3502 N. Elston Ave. The show runs 105 minutes, including an intermission. Performances are Fridays at 8pm, Saturdays at 4pm and 8pm and Sundays at 7pm through Dec. 20. <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1691768">Tickets</a> are $30-35 and seating is limited to 75 at each performance.

<p><em>Maul Santa (The Musical)</em>, with book by Ricky Glore and music by J. Sebastian Fabal, is a cross-genre production that plays until Dec. 19. Featuring a "real life" Santa and Mrs. Claus (and their two-elf entourage), <em>Maul Santa</em> seeks to answer the question, "What if the legendary gift-giving figurehead of Christmas got trapped in a mall with a bunch of zombies during a zombie apocalypse?"</p>

<p>Funny idea. But as with most new productions, the devil is in the details, and the details here fall short.</p>
        <p>Were there some good moments? Sure. I enjoyed Kyle Encinas as Barry (the comedic elf). He brought charm and humor to the role. And the switch in Mrs. Claus (played by Ali Delianides) was hysterical when she switched from mealy and subservient to kick-ass zombie slayer. There were also some winning numbers. "Zombie Killer Santa" was particularly funny with its classic heavy metal riffs. And the last number in the show, "Really Freaking Awesome," was catchy. </p>

<p>But overall, this production was uneven and lacked polish. The book wasn't very strong--the story had many holes and felt rushed. (The production only clocked in at 55 minutes with an intermission, so that wasn't my imagination.) The zombie cast repeated--I watched the same zombie (played by Noah Arnold) die five times as did his best to represent different random zombies. The prop guns and the fake blood were not convincing. A bullet belt was worn upside-down. The list goes on.</p>

<p>This production takes place at the Public House Theatre, which has a bar, so if one had a few drinks and had a large group of friends with them (and it were a late night show),  these flaws could be ignored. But overall, the production was uneven and lackluster and could have benefited from some more attention to detail. Not really what you want from a holiday show, when the idea is to either get in holiday spirit or forget the season altogether.</p>
