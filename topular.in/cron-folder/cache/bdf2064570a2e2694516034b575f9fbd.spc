With a devout following that numbers in the hundreds of thousands, people who have no interest in fashion at all know Prada. At times, one might question whether this is a fashion brand or a religion, and in some ways, there are some similarities. Its followers are devout and at times even evangelistic. There is a very tightly held calendar between when fashions appear on the runway and finally make it to stores. There is even a sense of liturgy, a kind of fashionista mass that takes place at each fashion show. Most seasons, one may need to call upon the divine interpretation of an intermediary, a Prada priest if you will, to interpret the meaning of a collection.</p>
<p>Every Prada collection is unique, a time capsule of its own that dates each season before it ever hits store shelves. There&#8217;s no questioning whether a piece was from last season or the season before. If one is a disciple, one knows when Miuccia used color blocking and when she used prints and when she resorted to peplum. We show up to Prada&#8217;s fashion week presentations prepared to need to think. What was her influence? Where was she going?</p>
<p>When today&#8217;s collection hit the runway, it was on a set constructed to look like a post-WWII agora, painted red, wood benches that might seem to have no order (though, they actually did), a PJHarvey soundtrack given a dreamy, trance-like mix. Photographer Nick Knight complained the whole thing was too dark, didn&#8217;t click, was void of a sense of life, but perhaps Nick wasn&#8217;t drinking the Prada grape juice so much this season. If anything, this is a collection that exists in that narrow gap of consciousness between being awake and being asleep, where one is not entirely sure what is real.</p>
<p>What is definitely real is a marine theme, complete with sailor hats and pea coats. Think mid-1940s, after the war, probably Paris though that was never actually expressed. The pieces are there, but they&#8217;re not in the right place. Lace-up waist cinchers are worn on the outside of dresses and coats. Detachable white collars are askew with one side undone. For many of the pieces, there is a large, bulky necklace that resembled an oversized charm bracelet. Severely oversized. There are no pants, only leggings.</p>
<p>Quilted jacquards, embroidered velvet, incredibly detailed brocades, coat sleeves made of fur, floral prints and embroidery, and large blue capes like those worn by military nurses came down the runway one after the other, leaving us somehow disconnected from a sense of place and time. A large number of purses were worn over the over the opposite shoulder, the straps crossing the chest, is a pseudo-military illusion. Some shoes laced straight up the leg while others were big and clunky. There&#8217;s no slipping through the house quietly in either.</p>
<p>Often, we are left to speculate just how much will be watered down in commercial versions of the clothes, but for this collection one can&#8217;t expect much change. While there is no shop-the-runway feature from Prada, the collection is already 90 percent commercial. The faithful will be proud. The faithful will be happy. The faithful will be trying to figure out how to keep that sailor&#8217;s hat on their head in a stiff wind (bobby pins, girls). There&#8217;s no deterring the faithful and this could be a collection that helps convert the cynical doubter. Don&#8217;t forget to leave your offering at the door on your way out.</p>

Generally speaking, I&#8217;m not interested and truly don&#8217;t care, except for that one time Anna Wintour was accidentally placed on the second row. The Fendi show had some special guests sitting front row this morning that helped set the tone for the entire show: The Kigurumi. What&#8217;s a Kigurumi? It&#8217;s a furry little creature from Japan that most notably tends to hang off the end of a Fendi handbag. They were introduced a couple of years ago with a likeness of Karl Lagerfeld and have since become so popular they&#8217;ve literally taken on a life of their own. The Kigurumi have become a central part of Fendi&#8217;s marketing toward new, younger customers and not only were they live and sitting front row this morning, but their tiny likenesses are the one thing from this runway that is for sale right now.</p>
<p>This was a noticeably lighter and friendlier face of Fendi as the collection was lighter on leather, heavier on silk and fur, and spreading ruffles everywhere. The collection starts with fairly classic silhouettes from the 70s. Trouser legs are full and flared, skirts are short, colors are bright, and there are plenty of stripes that soon enough becomes the waves that dominate the rest of the show. Knits dominate this section, if you can find them under the voluminous coats, and one will want to especially pay attention to the skirts that have broad, flat panels in front and back with sharp-creased pleats along both sides. The look is understated a bit the first few times we see it, but really becomes powerful when used with silk.</p>
<p>As the collection grows, we get more of an Asian influence to the collection, which is totally understandable given the brand&#8217;s popularity in both China and Japan.  Embroidered flowers are more prevalent here as is the use of silk with silhouettes that make maximum effect of straight lines and careful folds. If one can sneak a peek under the gigantic full-length fur coat, one see the final dress is a beautiful silk kimono-style dress with a ruffled tie and embroidered flowers.</p>
<p>Ruffles are the dominant element, though, and what one cannot help but notice is the legwear. From any distance, this looks like a thigh-high boot of some kind, but it&#8217;s not. These are thigh-high stockings with ruffles at the top with identically colored shoes that are also ruffled. The color matching creates a unified look that is stunning, but only works if one buys both the stockings and the shoes.</p>
<p>There are also ruffles on purses, fur on purses, embroidery on purses, and, of course, Kigurumi on purses. The purses this season are especially light-hearted, which might be a challenge given the normal Fendi woman is more professional in her tastes. But again, the brand needs to appeal to a younger audience and given the limited budget of millennials, purses are a good place to start.</p>
<p>One final observation comes as Sylvia Fendi and Karl Lagerfeld stepped to the top of the runway to take their bow. Ms. Fendi had started to take a couple of steps out of the doorway when Lagerfeld reached out and pulled her back. He then seemed to teeter and stumble just the slightest bit as he turned and made his exit. Let&#8217;s remember that Karl is 82 and while he&#8217;s always been careful to keep any infirmity or physical challenge very private, it is inevitable that sooner or later he will begin to falter. One cannot help but wonder if we accidentally caught just the slightest hint of frailty from the storied designer.</p>
<p>This was the most fun I&#8217;ve seen in a Fendi show and the attitude was quickly catching among guests who rushed to take selfies with the Kigurumi and, I would imagine, are buying up those purse fobs as quickly as possible. Appealing to a younger generation looks good on this brand. We&#8217;ll see if it actually works for them.</p>

Peter Dundas finally gets Roberto Cavalli. I was worried for a moment last season when Cavalli first introduced Dundas as his successor. Last season&#8217;s collection was very much out of character for the house and strayed from what we know Dundas is capable of doing. This season, though, Dundas not only nailed the Cavalli look, he may have presented his best collection ever.</p>
<p>For starters, Dundas got us out of that dank, damp basement he was in last September and into the more opulent, luxurious setting of the Palazzo Spinola, complete with crystal-laden chandeliers, candlelight and quiet harp music playing gently as guests entered. Settings can say a lot about a collection before it even hits the catwalk and this was one that was more like something Cavalli himself might have chosen.</p>
<p>The styles were straight up 1970s rock and roll. Think Mick Jagger&#8217;s wardrobe from about 1976 and you already have a good feel for where this is going. Necklines plunge as low as they dare go. Plants legs are flared. Silhouettes run lean and trim. Coats are long, luxurious, and covered in fur. There are long scarves with almost every ensemble, dashes of paisley and psychedelia, and even references back to classic rock such as the Beatles&#8217; Seargent Pepper album.</p>
<p>Fabrics were full of texture with enough crushed velvet to create a shortage in the market, plenty of leather and animal print, and a sufficient helping of gold lamé just in case one happens to run across a random disco. Where Dundas kept things contemporary is with a tremendous amount of sheer, mostly in tulle and chiffon, but with occasional forays into clear beaded sheer that might have been the only hiccup in the collection. I don&#8217;t know if there was a problem with the dress or the fact that she was, for all intents and purposes, bare ass naked on the catwalk, but the poor model wearing the first sheer beaded dress stumbled a bit as she made her entrance and looked absolutely mortified through the entirety of her walk. I can&#8217;t say I blame her in the least. Saran wrap would have hidden more. The dress itself is beautiful, but the model was obviously self-conscious.</p>
<p>Oh, but the mustard colored ruffles, the brocade, the incredible amount of bead work, the washed denim, and the heavy eye makeup were so spot on that I almost felt as though I were 20-something again. In fact, this was one of those collections that might inspire one to go out dancing were it not for the fact that this has been an incredibly long day. It was nearly 11:00 PM before everything was said and done which is extremely late even by fashion standards. Getting up in the morning is going to be a challenge for those of us who can remember the 70s the first time they came around.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see Peter Dundas adapting so well to his appointment to Roberto Cavalli. The old man wasn&#8217;t in the building tonight, but I&#8217;m sure he was keeping track of events from his yacht or something. This pairing looks as though it could go better than I had expected.</p>

I&#8217;m hearing that Cameramoda, the Italian agency responsible for putting on Milan Fashion Week, may have adjusted the schedule. I wouldn&#8217;t mind so much except for the fact that if another correction is not made Roberto Cavalli is likely to not start until 10:00 PM tonight! Fortunately, Allesandro Dell&#8217;Acqua started promptly at the new time, which is a bit of a rarity.</p>
<p>No. 21, or Numero Ventuno if you want to get picky, takes a bit of a turn toward grunge/punk with this collection, but does so in the nicest of ways. Everything is layered well, the looks are solid, and if one doesn&#8217;t glue their hair next to their head, which is apparently yet another global trend this season, then one might not be sure if this is really grunge or maybe just a dressed-up country feel. Sure, it had that grunge feel coming down the runway to a percussion-heavy soundtrack, but strip away the show and several of these looks might have just as easily come from the farm.</p>
<p>Central to this look is a large-checked red and black gingham that later moves into the brown/yellow variety.This is a look that is practically ubiquitous on farms from New England to Oregon during the winter. Whether Dell&#8217;Acqua was aware of that connection I don&#8217;t know, but it is a look that is very familiar to those of us who grew up in rural areas. There&#8217;s even lambswool lining on the coats. All that was missing was a John Deere ballcap and one goes from runway to rows of corn rather quickly.</p>
<p>Not that everything is gingham, mind you. He does mix the print with different floral patterns and the enlarges leopard print works better than one might have expected. The slouching cut of the silhouettes helps reinforce the grunge look a little and touches such as a single shoulder cutout on one piece, or trailing yellow straps on another keep the look contemporary. Hemlines on some of the longer dresses are politely asymmetrical, which is nice, but on the shorter dresses, we get a more plain, simple look.</p>
<p>What is big in this collection are the coats and the handful of sweaters. These have comfort written all over them as they&#8217;re all big enough to wrap around a time or two. The sweaters are multi-colored in a dark hue and especially attractive and snuggly.</p>
<p>There are some tastefully sheer elements here and there and lace along the sleeves and bottom of skirts is a nice touch. One will also notice the dark-toned patterned hose all the women are wearing. These do an excellent job of drawing attention to one&#8217;s legs should they be a dominant physical feature.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the collection, about the same time he also introduces the red/black gingham, Dell&#8217;Acqua tosses in a colorful tropical photoprint. While attractive, especially when used on a coat, the element is significantly brighter and more colorful than anything else in the collection and seems rather at odds. The contrast certainly gets one&#8217;s attention, though, and the pieces are well done enough to likely sell well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, how one interprets this collection is likely to depend on where one lives. For those who are urban in their taste and lifestyle, then this can be a grunge collection. If one is rural, this can be a very contemporary farm collection, complete with denim skirts. Make of it what you will, this is a very versatile, very wearable collection that isn&#8217;t nearly as tough as the attitude with which is was presented.</p>

That&#8217;s not a negative comment on the presentation, mind you, but simply a statement of how visually intense the experience was. Okay, so it started more than an hour late. We had warning early this morning when Gucci reset the clock on their website. Most people seem to adjust their schedule accordingly, though I feel a bit sorry for those who might have also had tickets to Fay. We were also warned at the door with a photosensitive seizure alert. I didn&#8217;t see anyone turning around at that point, but there were plenty of people popping some manner of medication on their way out the door.</p>
<p>In fashion, there are clothes made for wearing and there are clothes made to be seen. This collection falls fully in the latter category with an esoteric line that has influences from the 1960s, Spain, China, and the Victorian era. One doesn&#8217;t wear these clothes, one inhabits them. There were 70 ensembles in today&#8217;s show and finding cohesion between any of them is a challenge.</p>
<p>Even trying to decipher Alessandro Michele&#8217;s designer notes was impossible. Titled &#8220;Rhizomatic Scores,&#8221; the brand&#8217;s creative director babbles through four paragraphs before ending with a music score that looks like something from the archives of P.D.Q. Bach. In fact, the more I look at it, I&#8217;m pretty sure it <em>is</em> from the fictional composer. Yet, in a strange way that is difficult to describe, such randomness fits this Gucci collection quite well.</p>
<p>When the lights go down, a wall full of digital video screens lights up and flashes through a number of light patterns before showing time lapse video of flowers blooming and icebergs in reverse. A black tulle scrim between the audience and the runway gave an other-worldly feel to the models walking by, almost as though they were holograms (the effect also prevented anyone using a flash from taking a successful picture). Throughout the show, the digital background continued moving in one direction while the models walked in a different direction.</p>
<p>With such a large and disjointed collection, it is impossible to relate much more than basic trends. There were hats with mesh veils, a throwback to the late 1950s, early 60s. I used to have one but I&#8217;m not sure where it is now. There were monochrome looks in primary colors, though the Big Bird piece in yellow mohair is something we&#8217;ve seen before. There were various creative takes on the interlocking GG logo. Gowns were significant in number and sheer played a heavy role though not in any way that might be considered inappropriate. Ruffles and prints and patterns were commonplace, but he didn&#8217;t avoid plain, solid colored pieces either.</p>
<p>Still, there were some things that are just difficult to explain, such as the black gown with the huge black snake appearing to come up between the breasts. Or that one hat with tiny wings on the side. Then, there were the few patterned men&#8217;s suits that look as though they were perhaps made for Austin Powers, should that fictional personality ever make a return to the screen. Oh, and there&#8217;s an appliqued hydra in the mix too.</p>
<p>For those who love the artistic expression of fashion, the visceral exercise, and the visual challenge, this collection is a goldmine of genius. For those looking for something to wear to work this fall, this collection is a giant question mark likely full of expletives. Some will understand, most won&#8217;t. Most don&#8217;t want to have to work so hard at thinking about what their clothes mean.</p>
<p>Oh, but you&#8217;re going to have to wait six months to buy any of it. Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of Kering, S.A., which owns Gucci among other fashion brands, said yesterday that he has no plans for any of their labels offering any kind of see-now, buy-now option as has been popular in London and New York. Pinault feels that such a concept &#8220;negates the dream&#8221; of luxury. He might know what he&#8217;s talking about, given that Gucci just had one of its strongest quarters of growth ever.</p>
<p>So, our eyes have plenty of time to recover from today&#8217;s spectacle before we see these clothes again. That&#8217;s not so bad, really. My head is still swirling. Six months should be about right.</p>

London&#8217;s &#8220;week&#8221; is only five days, the shortest of the big four, and even then, the majority of major designers are crammed into the middle three days. Not being sufficiently far enough on the inside of matters, I don&#8217;t understand why more designers don&#8217;t show here. From this perspective, London is the most well organized of the four, with plenty of opulent settings if that&#8217;s what one desires, or more basic facilities for labels on tighter budgets. I don&#8217;t know what budgets here tend to run, but certainly it can&#8217;t be more expensive than New York or Paris, and I don&#8217;t know of any major editors or buyers who skip London. So, why not show here and make LFW a couple of days longer? Is it the weather? Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, but I&#8217;m in no hurry to move on to Milan tomorrow.</p>
<p>The work of Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida is a perfect example of why London Fashion Week is so exciting. Here are two young designers, one coming from Vivienne Westwood and the other from Preen, merging their talents to take fashion in a different direction, one that identifies more with individual tastes and styles rather than trends or rules. In fact, many design rules crumble a bit under the influence of these two. Winners of last year&#8217;s LVMH prize for young designers, Marques&#8217; Almeida represents a dynamic future for British design and I would love to see more like them.</p>
<p>Underscoring that sense of individuality this season, Marques&#8217; Almeida made the decision to not cast their show today with the usual spate of models who, by this point, have very tired feet and bags under their eyes that are difficult to hide. Instead, the duo cast more &#8220;natural&#8221; women of various ages and sizes. As a result, what we saw were styles that work for women with wider hips, or broader shoulders, or something other than a perfectly flat stomach. The women, and the fashion they wore, were more like you, the people who ultimately buy the clothes. While this isn&#8217;t the only show where this has happened this season, how Marques and Almeida treat women is more flattering and void of condescension.</p>
<p>Right from the start, the duo gives us a sense of their version of practicality. An oversized red/white gingham checked shirt, which may or may not be used as a nightshirt, is under a tie-dyed slip dress, with mesh heels. Mesh plays a rather heavy role in providing both layer and texture to this collection; it&#8217;s a high-tech fabric that rather feels a bit like plastic but is much more malleable and cooperative. Prints throughout the collection are lively and amusing, with bright colors on some, exaggerated houndstooth on others, and repeating appearance of ginghams, all crafted in ways that are sort of traditional, but put together in ways one might not have considered before today.</p>
<p>Grabbing a lion&#8217;s share of the attention are a set of immense coats, so puffy and quilted that they almost look like flotation devices. To say these coats are huge would be an understatement, and I can see one encountering a bit of difficulty trying to squeeze behind the wheel of a car or settle comfortably on public transit while wearing one of these behemoths. They look fun, though, and are likely to be among the first of many items to sell out.</p>
<p>A lot is already being said about the shoes as well, which have the letters M and A built into their construction. I apologize for not having better pictures of them for you, but shoe fetishists are going to put those on their &#8220;must have&#8221; lists for this fall.</p>
<p>There is a lot of layering, asymmetric hems and shapes, and generously full cuts. Colors are very bright and run the spectrum. Some edges are raw and frayed, but most are finished off rather nicely. There are occasional touches of faux fur, a bit of denim, and a touch of leather, but none to any extreme. The few crocheted pieces in the collection are understated but incredibly well done and their long size makes them attractive for those who like to snuggle.</p>
<p>The Marques&#8217; Almeida collection a wonderful place to end our time in London. This is a wonderfully accessible line of clothing that any woman can wear and enjoy. If this is the future of British fashion, I do hope we start spending more than five days here so we can enjoy it all.</p>

The electronic tones set an atmosphere for a futuristic take on an icy planet for this fall/winter collection.</p>
<p>We also know how much British fans love science fiction, particularly the long-running Dr. Who series, which defies all odds and continues over 20 years despite changing out primary characters on a regular basis. There was a hint of that not only in the background but in silhouettes that were modern and yet played on the past a bit as well. I was rather waiting for a Dalek-inspired piece to come down the runway but, alas, it never happened.</p>
<p>What we did see were a number of diamond-shaped prints on cool-toned metallics that provided a futuristic shimmer to the collection. Prints are the mainstay of any Pilotto collection, of course, but the prints may have been outdone this season by the quilted embroideries that adorned many of the pieces, especially at the beginning of the collection. If he was going for something that would create a futuristic tone, that design full of squiggles and swirls and abstract shapes nailed the look and gave the clothes an interesting touch that was a nice contrast to the rather simple but no less attractive prints.</p>
<p>We also see a tremendous amount of quilting and embroidery in the coats. One heavy coat looks much like a comforter suitable for cold-weather cuddling, a theme we&#8217;ve seen recurring this season. Pilotto&#8217;s coats are full to the point of being oversized and many look as though one might hide an extra person beneath them.</p>
<p>While the silhouettes are fairly fitted and many of the fabrics lightweight, not every element is as futuristic as one might expect. There are still peplum-like ruffles popping up every now and then, which is something one might hope we would abandon in the future. I&#8217;m not too sure about the sandals over suede footwear, either; is the suede supposed to be some type of stocking? There was no immediate explanation of those curiosities.</p>
<p>Any shortcomings, though, can be forgiven. Pilotto&#8217;s mix of fabrics and patterns is, as always, quite masterful and creative. He pulls together disparate pieces and shapes that, in theory, probably shouldn&#8217;t work together. Yet, somehow, he manages to make them into the most beautiful of dresses. For such a forward-looking collection, these pieces are immensely wearable right now. In fact, a collection like this makes a good argument for being able to buy directly off the runway. Too bad Pilotto doesn&#8217;t make that option available this season. Hopefully, he&#8217;ll correct that little detail by fall. After all, in the future we don&#8217;t have to wait for fashion.</p>

No umbrella handy when it rains? Just grab a plastic bag and toss it over your head. Looking for a place to stick those earrings without them getting lost? Why, just attach them to your dress or overcoat! Tired of that cute little stud in your nose piercing? Great news: you can now wear a decoration long enough to look like sparkling snot and it&#8217;s not (be careful how you say that) a problem. Why? Because Christopher Kane just put all that and more in his fall/winter ready-to-wear (or is it ready-to-donate?) collection.</p>
<p>Before you think I&#8217;m unnecessarily or unfairly bashing Kane, let&#8217;s be quite clear on one matter: it is the eccentrics and avant-garde that push fashion forward. As strange as these ensembles may look to us now, they help us explore new and different ways of designing and dressing. They create new silhouettes, test the rationality of new designs, and can be the forerunners of whole new movements. So don&#8217;t think for a moment that I don&#8217;t appreciate what Kane is doing here. I get it. I understand.</p>
<p>Still, it is very difficult for me to watch this show and not giggle all the way through it. In his notes, Kane refers to this collection as &#8220;Lost and Found,&#8221; saying that it is one that has been on his mind for a while. In fact, he&#8217;s been gathering and saving pieces to put in this collection for some time. His concept is to explore the fashion and style of the ultimate outsider, a recluse who makes her way by hoarding things. He says this is, &#8220;looking to an outsider who has her own rules and her own style – she does what she wants and defines her own beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose that means we&#8217;re celebrating the folks that dig through the dumpster behind the Goodwill rather than the comparatively rich folks who shop there. In many ways, this does look like a collection that blends pieces that might have once been tossed in the rubbish bin with thrift shop bargains. Floral patterns are mismatched. Knits are all knotted. There&#8217;s a full-length ostrich feather protruding from a shoe.</p>
<p>What a minute, not everything is quite what it seems. That stuff looking like corrugated cardboard? Yeah, that would be textured leather. Those floral prints? Welcome to the world of photo-real printing where the magic of time-lapse photography captured the entire life cycle of a flower and merged those images together for these unique prints. Chantilly lace is mixed with scrim to achieve a worn, faded look. There&#8217;s magic taking place among the textiles that will influence how clothes are made for years to come. Even those trash-bag bonnets are actually the high-tech products of milliner Stephen Jones.</p>
<p>One person&#8217;s treasure may still look like &#8230;</p>
<p>Christopher Kane has always been a champion of individuality, coloring outside the lines, off the paper, and up the wall. He says that parts of this season draw on memories of his childhood. My, want an interesting and colorful childhood  this young Scot must have had.</p>
<p>The only question I see remaining is whether people will actually purchase these creative garments that Mr. Kane has made, or will they go through dumpsters for themselves and when challenged just claim they&#8217;re wearing Christopher Kane.

By far the largest show of the week and the one that inevitably gets the most attention, Christopher Bailey knows well that every fashionable eye is watching the moment the lights dim and the music begins to play for one of his runway presentations. This season the attention may even be a bit heavier than usual. A couple of weeks ago the label announced that they would be canceling their menswear shows and integrating them in with the womenswear. They also announced limited runway sales starting immediately after the show. The biggest announcement, perhaps, was that starting in September their shows will be seasonless. Instead of the September collection being listed as Spring/Summer, as has been the tradition, theirs will simply be September, and the full collection will be for sale immediately following the show.</p>
<p>Bailey is as much a master of marketing as he is a genius at capturing trends and integrating them into his label. He uses both culture and climate to create runway presentations that are like twenty-minute commercials. Each one is unique, defined as much by its non-fashion elements as the styles that walk their runway. This season, Bailey totally changed the tone by covering the glass-enclosed show space at Kensington Gardens with heavy drapes, creating a dark and moody atmosphere. For music, he returned to using a single acoustic artist with Jake Bugg&#8217;s soulful sound that reminds one of a young James Taylor circa 1973. The floor was a light-toned wood and the lights stayed more dim than what would be normal for a Burberry show.</p>
<p>The feel was of the 1970s. This is a collection where pants legs are flared, but if they come past mid-calf they&#8217;re too long. Emerald green is a primary color but there are few solids as diamond-patterned prints rule the day. Brown patterned leggings are standard underneath skirts and dresses, and embellishments on shoes, such as buckles and tassels are a bit large. Military-style coats with big brass buttons are frequent and men&#8217;s ties are narrow, knit, and have a squared-off end to them. And if you don&#8217;t have at least one coat or jacket with a wide lambswool collar this fall, then one is terribly out of touch.</p>
<p>We see a lot more full-body bead work in this collection, and the amount of sequins is higher than normal,  even taking over men&#8217;s trousers on a couple of occasions. Psychedelic brocade makes more than one appearance as does a very shimmery patchwork pattern. There are metallics blended in here and there throughout the collection, making them feel ubiquitous even though, for the most part, they&#8217;re pretty much there for embellishment. Rectangle shaped cutouts down the center of women&#8217;s dresses re-shape the concept of a plunging neckline while tweeds fade into the background quietly, the least we&#8217;ve seen of them in recent memory.</p>
<p>This is definitely a fall/winter collection, which makes me incredibly curious as to what we will see in the September collection. Will it be more of the same, or will Bailey go in a completely different direction yet again, essentially creating two fall collections within the same 12 months? I&#8217;m sure he has already figured out exactly what is likely to work best for the Burberry label. Nothing seems to get past him or escape his attention. I hope other designers are paying attention. We&#8217;re watching a dramatic shift in fashion presentation unfold before our eyes.</p>

After several seasons of showing in Paris, Sarah Burton brought the label&#8217;s fall/winter show back home to London and British fans couldn&#8217;t have been more happy. The stage was set with immense floor-to-ceiling semi-sheer black drapes and a feeling of somberness late on this Sunday evening. A sense of formality was here that doesn&#8217;t exist in most UK shows, which tend to feel rather casual. McQueen has returned! This is going to be wonderful!</p>
<p>For the pop culture fans of McQueen, those who watch year after year with little hope of ever affording or actually wearing anything from the brand, the collection was gorgeous. They oohed and awwed as they tweeted their excitement and pleasure at a collection that dripped with embellishments and draping gold necklaces and bondage-styled belts around the pants. They swooned over the femininity of the chiffon with it&#8217;s harness-styled cutouts. They adored the pink pleated skirts laser cut into lace. They giggled at the dresses that looked more like lingerie and questioned whether the penultimate piece was a coat or actually a bedspread because, being so large and quilted, surely it could be either.</p>
<p>Fashion&#8217;s insiders, however, took a slightly different approach. They questioned whether Ms. Burton had become bored with McQueen. After all, her name was floated for however brief a moment as a possible successor to Raf Simons at Dior. A year ago, her name wouldn&#8217;t have come up at all. And whether one immediately realizes it or not, Burton leans more heavily on the McQueen archive this season than she has previously. While butterflies were a motif that McQueen used often, as was the harness silhouette, the level of embellishment this season felt in some ways more like Mary Katrantzou than McQueen. The lingerie pieces seem out of step with the rest of the collection and by the time we saw the gowns there was some sense the original theme had been abandoned altogether.</p>
<p>So, which view is correct? Both, I think. I see no problem with enjoying the elements that appeal to one&#8217;s personal sense of aesthetic. Fashion should be personal and when certain designs speak to an individual there is no right nor wrong to that piece; one buys it if they can and appreciates it if they can&#8217;t. Butterflies are a wonderful theme and the embellishments are quite well done throughout the line. The gowns especially, with their sheer and beads and, in one instance, gold lamé, are wonders to behold even if one would never be so rich as to buy one, or dare to actually wear one out in public. Admire the fashion and styles for what makes you happy.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can realize that there is an ebb and flow to staying with a fashion house long term. Some seasons have a lot of energy and creativity behind them, but then some seasons need to rely on the archives in order to fulfill all the obligations a designer has in the modern environment. Be sure, Burton&#8217;s family life plays into this as well as the twins are now in their tyrannical threes and Sarah is a very dedicated and hands-on Mommy. Acknowledging the possibility that maybe, just maybe, Ms. Burton is absolutely exhausted isn&#8217;t an insult. Even if she is a bit bored, that may well pass as she puts this season behind her and heads into spring/summer 2017.</p>
<p>Either way, this was still an exciting and entertaining presentation, full of the beauty and wonder that comes with simply being Alexander McQueen. The label is back in London and its British fans are hoping it stays forever.</p>
