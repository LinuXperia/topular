That was my initial question after watching a purposely shocking ad featuring young girls dropping f-bombs in the name of feminism.</p>
<a href="http://popdust.com/2014/10/22/little-girls-f-bomb-swearing-feminist-fckh8-ad-pulled-youtube/">The ad, "Potty-Mouthed Princesses Drop F-Bombs For Feminism" is for clothing company FCKH8 and has already been pulled from YouTube.</a>

While one could debate the merits of pulling the ad (and YouTube user standards) I am more disturbed by the use of young girls in such an inappropriate manner. I say this as a father of three girls, ages 16, 7 and 4. All of my girls love(d) dress up and have rich imaginations. But using swearing children to preach feminism is the equivalent to using a giant pink gorilla on top of an auto dealership as shock overwhelms substance.

I simply have no use for profanity and believe in the adage that those who use it profusely have little else to say. Plenty of comedians and more than a few bloggers thrive with language that would make a longshoreman blush. It's just not for me. My kids (particularly my two teenagers) don't swear because I don't swear. The strongest phrase from my younger kids is "what the what" and they are both convinced that the "S word" is stupid.

I was also struck by the adult images; young girls dressed in "princess" dresses in full makeup. Again the point is valid - we do live in a highly sexualized society that places real pressures on young women. But the ad is no less offensive. My other questions:

<strong>What is the audience for the FCKH8</strong> <strong>ad? </strong>I presume the Potty-Mouthed Princesses are aimed at adults as no right minded television honcho would run this on Saturday morning cartoon hour. Not that the kiddie hour is full of wholesome images. I'm also bothered by characters such as  <a href="http://disneychannel.disney.com/the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody">"Disney kids" Zach and Cody</a> who talk back to adults and lead somehow lead independent lives at the age of 11.

<strong>What parent would put their child in this ad? </strong>I'm sure the response would be that it's cute or funny, but at who's expense? Sexism, inequality and violence against women are serious topics. Using foul mouthed kids misses the point. I'm fine with kids playing dress-up in advertising for the right reasons.

It's hard not to root for the Royals and marvel at their remarkable run. Here are 5 things to love about the this year's Kansas City Royals:

<strong>1) The Kansas City Royals beat tremendous odds.</strong> Let's face it - major league baseball is essentially rigged. Without a salary cap or true revenue sharing it safe to say a third of teams have no real shot at winning even in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball">Moneyball</a>, sabermetrics era. Deep pockets in big TV markets such as New York and Los Angeles mean almost certain success. The Kansas City Royals are in the World Series despite  <a href="http://www.stevetheump.com/Payrolls.htm">consistently having one of the lowest payrolls in baseball</a>.

<strong>2) The Kansas City Royals are the epitome of a team.</strong>  Quickly, can you name two members of the Kansas City Royals? George Brett, the greatest Royal, retired over twenty years ago. While toiling in midwest obscurity its safe to say most fans <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article2634130.html">couldn't pick these guys out of a lineup</a>. No matter as the Royals jelled at the right time. Third baseman <a href="http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/mike-moustakas-unlikely-power-source-for-royals-with-four-homers-in-postseason-1.9503757">Mike Moustakas was sent down to the minors </a> during the season before becoming a playoff hero. Pitcher <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/11661038/kc-royals-reliever-brandon-finnegan-rapid-rise">Brandon Finnegan was pitching in the College World Series last spring</a>.

<strong>3) The Kansas City Royals didn't just crash the party; they kicked the door in and stormed the dance floor.  </strong>The Royals have yet to lose a playoff game. First came a one game wild card win over the Oakland A's, followed by a three game sweep of the Los Angeles Angels (think big market bully), then a four game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles and a chance <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/kansas-city/story/royals-long-road-back-continues-as-corks-pop-for-fourth-time-in-three-weeks-101514">pop the champagne for the fourth time in three weeks</a>.

<strong>4) The Kansas City Royals are a lesson in perseverance. </strong>Royals founder Ewing Kaufman feared new owners would move the team noting, "No one would want to buy a baseball team that consistently loses millions of dollars and had little prospect of making money because it was in a small city." General Manager Dayton Moore preached patience to restless fans as slowly built from within. The Royals consist of, for the most part, home grown, inexpensive talent, a necessary formula for any small market team hoping to compete.

<strong>5) The Kansas City Royals have humble leaders.</strong>  There are no player hystrionics. In management there are no Mark Cuban, Mike Ditka types. Manager Ned Yost could easily be your neighborhood PTA president. It's hard not to pull for the underdog.

By regular I mean twice, maybe three times a month, often with kids in tow or on my way back from a morning drop off.

They are always open and there's always a decent line. Wasn't it Yogi Berra who said "Nobody goes there because it's always too crowded?" The shop is small with no frills. Kitchen in back, bagels and packaged cream cheese, lox and orange juice in front. A small coffee maker and a few newspapers. There's even a tiny television behind the counter.  No tables, carry out only.

The staff is efficient, sometimes a bit gruff. But the bagels are fantastic.

On a recent Saturday morning I was next in line for bagels when a man walked up next to me. He was alone, looked to be mid 50s in an oxford shirt and khakis. Immediately the woman behind the counter said, "Where were you last week?" as she reached down and placed a full order of bagels and cream cheese on the counter. As he reached for his wad of cash he explained that he was sick the prior week. When I asked he said he has been coming to the shop every Saturday morning at 9:30 for 25 years, with smiles and confirmation from the staff.

As he walked away I couldn't help but wonder what were the bagels for? His children (if he has them), for work, for  a religious gathering or club? Does he live in the neighborhood?

I was struck by the idea that someone could stick to a routine for a quarter century. Other than waking up and going to bed I can't think of anything I have done with that type of consistency for 25 years. I also marvel at the sense of community represented by an "order ready" customer and concern when he's not there. I'd like to learn more about the relationship between owner and customer and his place in the community.

Which should be easy to do on any Saturday morning at 9:30.

Have you ever stuck to a routine like Saturday bagels?

With four children ages 4 to 16 mine is packed. Besides the obvious items like sports gear, kleenex and wipes mine is tricked out with two miniature folding chairs and a blanket, swimsuits and goggles, a bag of toys, books and chachkies. A deck of cards in the glove compartment comes in handy in waiting rooms or parking lots.

My girls spend a lot of time at high school sporting events (mainly wrestling meets and football games). We're easy to find, either in the corner of the gym or stands encamped like tourists, complete with backpacks, iPods and survival skills that would earn us a few merit badges.

My teenagers graduated from the weekend adventure stage some time ago, now they are on auto pilot as I nurture two young girls. What I've learned through the years is the importance of trying to see the world through the eyes of a child.

For one thing, your fantasy is not their reality. I remember when I was six my mother took me and my sister on the El to see Cinderella at the Chicago Theater. I don't remember the show. Instead I remember my first subway ride, staring at blank faces in a tunnel of noise.

Years ago I took my twins to Lincoln Park Zoo for the first time thinking they would be thrilled seeing lions and bears. They fixated instead on a squirrel stopped in our path. Kids are impulsive and unpredictable. For a child the mundane is amazing, whether its <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/just-getting-started/2014/06/3-reasons-i-love-hardware-stores/">trips to the hardware store</a> or run ins with a squirrel. Somehow we outgrow that before adulthood.

Recently I had a full summer Saturday to plan a pocket adventure with my daughters, ages 7  and 4. My kids (all four of them) have always loved trains; we often hop on the el and ride it back and forth. Talk about a cheap thrill - where else can see an entire city for $2.25? On this day we boarded a bus and took it to the brown line. From the Kimball brown line station we rode downtown to Quincy. Along the way they each had their notebooks to talk and write about what they saw.

How to make it work? Three tips:

<strong>1) Make everything a game.</strong> On the train, how many trees do you see? When walking the city, let's look for buildings to explore. From there we made a brief stop at McDonalds (what we refer to as the carrot) and explored the Loop.

<strong>2) Be flexible.</strong> All I planned on was riding the CTA...my low budget roller coaster. The rest was up to the kiddos. As we walked by the Field Building my four year old said, "Let's go in here" so we did, wandering the lobby before squatting in a bookstore for an hour or so. From there we walked back to the JW Marriott for escalator rides and a bathroom break before wandering over to Millennium Park (another carrot). Keep things simple and pick your teachable moments. This time, in answer to the question "Why is that man sleeping on the sidewalk?" my answer was a calm "Because he's tired."

<strong>3) Plan your crescendo but don't tell them.</strong> Otherwise you'll never hear the end of it. On this day it was an ice cream cone by the red line station (big ol' bag of carrots) only a rookie parent would make the reveal too early. Why get ice cream when you have a good half mile walk back to the train?

How do you keep the kids occupied? I would enjoy hearing from you in the comments section.

Each day I would report to a dimly lit, closet size room in the basement.

That was the job. I was on my feet for hours, feeding the beast. It was monotonous; like operating an elevator in a coal mine. It was dusty, dirty, relentless work. The only highlight was when the custodian would wheel up a new barrel of files and talk about the Bears, except after a day or two it dawned on me that it was all he ever talked about.

The pay was decent considering there was no technical skill required. I was glad to get my check and go back to school.

While on duty I learned that I was filling in for a regular employee on vacation. In other words, the bank paid someone to do this kind of work full time, something my teenage self absorbed mind could barely grasp.

Working in the bank basement was as crummy job but it gave me a greater appreciation for all types of labor while reaffirming my desire to get a college degree. I have worked in a couple of banks since my week with the giant shredder and often smile while dumping items into the large shredding bins, which these days are picked up and professionally shredded offsite.

Baseball and smokeless tobacco have a long association (some might say oral fixation) unlike any other professional sport. The image of a baseball player of manager with a "puffed out" cheek is as commonplace as pine tar and eye black at the ballpark. Why baseball and not other sports? Good question. It's hard to picture an NFL running back or NBA point guard with a wad of Levi Garrett. Maybe it's because baseball involves so much down time whether in the dugout or on the field between pitches?

Tradition is not the reason to allow chewing tobacco in professional baseball.  In fact minor league baseball has banned chewing tobacco for over 20 years with little impact.

Personally I'm against any baseball chewing tobacco ban, believing adults should be able to make their own decisions. Which begs the question; why are we still marketing "tobacco alternatives"such as Big League Chew bubble gum to kids?

Big League Chew comes shredded in a stay fresh pouch. Kids can reach in and pinch several strands of bubble gum before placing in their mouth along their cheek. Sound familiar?

I understand that Big League Chew has<a href="http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/9023097/matt-kemp-cole-hamels-agree-big-league-chew-images-adorned-shredded-gum-pouches"> redesigned the package while signing on some major league endorsers</a>.

We are regularly treated to "welcome home" images as soldiers return to their loved ones. Firefighters and police officers are also rightly viewed as people dedicated to a cause greater than themselves. As the son of a retired Naval Commander I have always honored the sacrifices of families here and abroad.

But what about journalists? The word hero comes to mind when reading about the bravery of <a href="http://news.msn.com/us/american-journalist-killed-in-syria-aware-of-risks?gt1=51501">James Foley, a free lance journalist who was beheaded in Syria by ISIS terrorists</a>. His mother, Diane Foley, said in a statement that her son "gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people." Foley's death comes roughly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/20/from-daniel-pearl-to-james-foley-the-modern-tactic-of-islamist-beheadings/">12 years after the death of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl</a>.

The shocking executions of James Foley and Daniel Pearl remind us of the risks journalists face both here and overseas. Reporters are regularly exposed to danger as they visit crime scenes to gather information along with the police. Look no further than Ferguson, Missouri where last week where <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/journalist-says-he-was-attacked-at-ferguson-scene/article_9759b453-60c2-5d6b-817f-eeffeccbf667.html">journalists were attacked </a> and<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/washington-post-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/"> arreste</a>d while covering the death of Michael Brown.

It's easy to forget in the age of blogs and twitter the crucial role of true journalism (the pen and paper variety, not the talking head blowhards). Reporters are often our only window and witness to the truth. Much like a firefighter running into a burning building, reporters often rush into the line of fire to provide their account. Whether covering war or a traffic accident it's still story telling. "Journalism is journalism," James Foley once said. "If I had a choice to do Nashua (New Hampshire) zoning meetings or give up journalism, I'll do it. I love writing and reporting."
<div>I studied at the University of Missouri School of Journalism and often recall this passage from Founder Walter Williams' <a href="http://www.mopress.com/creed.php">journalist creed </a>:</div>
<blockquote>I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust. ... the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.</blockquote>
Newspapers are in free fall these days and most have <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123197973917183829">closed their foreign bureaus</a>. Journalism is an evolving business. But without journalists who would witness for the public good?

Firefighters and police officers are also rightly viewed as people dedicated to a cause greater than themselves. As the son of a retired Naval Commander I have always honored the sacrifices of families here and abroad.

But what about journalists? The word hero comes to mind when reading about the bravery of <a href="http://news.msn.com/us/american-journalist-killed-in-syria-aware-of-risks?gt1=51501">James Foley, a free lance journalist who was beheaded in Syria by ISIS terrorists</a>. His mother, Diane Foley, said in a statement that her son "gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people." Foley's death comes roughly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/20/from-daniel-pearl-to-james-foley-the-modern-tactic-of-islamist-beheadings/">12 years after the death of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl</a>.

The shocking executions of James Foley and Daniel Pearl remind us of the risks journalists face both here and overseas. Reporters are regularly exposed to danger as they visit crime scenes to gather information along with the police. Look no further than Ferguson, Missouri where last week where <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/journalist-says-he-was-attacked-at-ferguson-scene/article_9759b453-60c2-5d6b-817f-eeffeccbf667.html">journalists were attacked </a> and<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/08/13/washington-post-reporter-arrested-in-ferguson/"> arreste</a>d while covering the death of Michael Brown.

It's easy to forget in the age of blogs and twitter the crucial role of true journalism (the pen and paper variety, not the talking head blowhards). Reporters are often our only window and witness to the truth. Much like a firefighter running into a burning building, reporters often rush into the line of fire to provide their account. Whether covering war or a traffic accident it's still story telling. "Journalism is journalism," James Foley once said. "If I had a choice to do Nashua (New Hampshire) zoning meetings or give up journalism, I'll do it. I love writing and reporting."
<div>I studied at the University of Missouri School of Journalism and often recall this passage from Founder Walter Williams' <a href="http://www.mopress.com/creed.php">journalist creed </a>:</div>
<blockquote>I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust. ... the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.</blockquote>
Newspapers are in free fall these days and most have <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123197973917183829">closed their foreign bureaus</a>. Journalism is an evolving business. But without journalists who would witness for the public good?

I'm a fan of "<em>The Killing.</em>" I never saw the original Danish show but got caught up in the well written, smartly cast American version. After three seasons on AMC "The Killing" was canceled only to be picked up by Netfix for six final episodes.
<div>

What's great about "The Killing?"
<div><b>1) The flawed main characters. </b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_(U.S._TV_series)">"<em>The Killing</em>" is a dark, disturbing show </a>with disturbed lead characters. Detective Sarah Linden (played by Mireille Enos) has more baggage than a royal vacation, abandoned by her mother before abandoning her son.  Detective Stephen Holder (played by Joel Kinnaman), who speaks in hip hop (picture Eminem with a badge), is an addict and the perfect yin to Linden's yang.</div>
<b>2) The dramatic music at the end of each episode</b>. Plots on "The Killing" involve one murder per season. Because each episode is a continuation <i>"The Killing"</i> isn't meant for channel surfers. The final scenes are a warning, underscored by music, that the episode is ending with a tantalizing, multi-tiered cliffhanger.

<b>3) The dreary nature of the show and plot lines.</b> <i>"The Killing"</i> is set in Seattle but its no chamber of commerce ad. Yes it rains in Seattle (I've been) but to watch<i> "The Killing" </i>you would think every day is dark, damp and foreboding. It sets the tone.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7bvCeNwoRJs" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<div>I watched the first five episodes of the final season and loved where it was going, as Linden and Holder set out to solve a new murder case and wrestle with their demons, including Linden murdering her ex-lover who turned out to be a serial killer (the one she had been tracking in the prior season).  The finale itself was chilling for about 45 minutes as we witness the dramatic resolution of the case and Linden's subsequent murder  confession and resignation from the force.</div>
Then we entered bizzaro land as the writers abandoned the tone, writing style, thematic elements and character of the show.
<div>Inexplicably we flash forward five years or so and watch Holder kiss his school age daughter goodbye before Linden reappears at his workplace. It's sunny!?! She's wearing make up!?! She longs for him and confesses that she never knew what she had, is done "chasing bad guys" and embraces Holder. I expected to see roses fall from the sky, Linden and Holder hold hands and exchange sappy looks while prancing through a meadow.</div>
&nbsp;
<div><strong><i>"The Killing"</i> resorted to a hokey American ending because Americans forever seek closure</strong>. Hooey. <a href="http://www.screenjunkies.com/tv/genres-tv/sitcoms/law-and-order-episodes-twenty-seasons-of-excellence/">If I want neat and clean I'll watch "<em>Law and Order</em>."</a> Are we that unsophisticated as to only accept neatly threaded endings? What's wrong with not knowing what happens to Holder, his fiancee' and unborn child? Why can't we be left to wonder where Linden ended up after leaving her badge in the interrogation room?</div>
&nbsp;
<div>The idea that two troubled people would end up together is not far fetched (I could speculate that Holder went on a few dates with the Narcotics Anonymous crowd already). But it just felt cheap and contrived.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
&nbsp;
<div>Or setting the stage for a sequel? To paraphrase Holder , "I wouldn't watch that one, mamasita."</div>

It's still there, I suppose, but you wouldn't know it. Not from the efforts I make each day to remember what I'm having for dinner before I have lunch.

Back in the day I was a legend. Friends and countrymen used to gather to watch me feed my elastic, bottomless gut. Many nights I would inhale an entire pizza at midnight, top it off with a smidgen of Jamoca Almond Fudge and fall asleep within the hour.

Today that combination would give me night sweats and bed spins.

I was a fat kid until age ten or so. Then I grew (7 inches in two years) and proceeded to munch on those who picked on me. By eighth grade I towered over my classmates. They caught up just as I hit my caloric prime.

In high school I was an athlete so, you know, I needed massive amounts of grub. I was active so I wasn't fat, plus I had this supersonic metabolism and would snatch food like a Venus Fly Trap. I plowed my way into my 20's and early 30's without a care about my weight. I remember going to lunch with a colleague and heading to the bathroom only to have a bus boy bring an extra chair out for our imaginary, hungry friend.  "I thought you were expecting another," he said with a sheepish grin. No that extra entree is for me, thank you very much.

But those days are gone. The day I turned 40 my metabolism came to a screeching halt. It's gone, along with some hair (which I'm convinced jumped from the crown of my head to my ears) and the ability to consume anything after 5 p.m. Mind you I don't go to sleep early. Somehow aging means I eat less and sleep less. These days I sit down with my low fat, low carb munchies, stare at the kids and realize I'm this close to strained prunes and a round of canasta.

Oh ye metabolism, where have you gone? I yearn for the good old days.
