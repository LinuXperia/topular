<p>The weekend after Ween brought their reunion party to the Centennial State, Greensky Bluegrass kept the Brown flowing in Colorado.</p>
<p>The band debuted their version of Ween&#8217;s &#8220;Your Party&#8221; as the encore to their second of two shows at Avon&#8217;s Winter Wondergrass festival.  They must have liked how it came out, as they referenced it in their &#8220;thank you&#8221; to the festival and fans via their official Facebook page.

The show also featured a sit-in by jam-scene DJ-in-residence DJ Logic who scratched his way through a huge &#8220;Broke Mountain Breakdown&#8221;.  Here&#8217;s the full set, though you&#8217;ll have to scrub to approximately the 54 minute mark for your taste of the Womp that accompanied the Twang.</p>

<p>Greensky played a shorter set on Saturday, but got the crowd going by dropping unexpected into a day-appropriate Grateful Dead classic as the second song and welcoming Leftover Salmon&#8217;s Andy Thorn to the stage for &#8220;Burn Them&#8221;.  Here&#8217;s video of The Four &gt; One More Saturday Night, captured by <a class="yt-uix-sessionlink g-hovercard      spf-link " href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTu66uYYyT3TCU5-NXAQuAg" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">The Lot Scene</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-29538" href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/into-the-swamp-with-scott-mcmicken-of-dr-dog-29535.html/final-swamp-is-on-poster-rgb"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29538" src="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/wp-content/uploads/FINAL-SWAMP-IS-ON-POSTER-RGB.jpg" alt="FINAL SWAMP IS ON POSTER RGB" width="640" height="416" /></a></p>
<p>Dr. Dog’s newest album, <em>Psychedelic Swamp</em>, is Part Two of a concept that has been sixteen years in the making. The album is presented as a message from a character named Phrases, who sent the band a cassette tape detailing his existence in The Swamp, hoping to reach the masses. Unfortunately, the communication soaked in the mud for too long, and is barely comprehensible, hazy and jumbled.</p>
<p>The band’s job is to interpret this tape via their own American popular music sensibilities so we can all heed the warning.  Yes, this is their second swing at it&#8230; their first try was actually the band&#8217;s debut album.  Not exactly a remake, not exactly an update &#8212; the second chapter has been accompanied via a collaborative rock opera, multimedia event with the folks at Pig Iron Theater.</p>
<p>We caught up with guitarist and co-songwriter, Scott McMicken, to talk All Things Swamp and more.</p>
<p><strong>What was the <em>Swamp Is On</em> experience like?</strong></p>
<p>Really incredible. The concept was really an insular and private experience for those of us involved in it way back when. But it was very large in our imagination.</p>
<p>Then to have it open up so many years later, to so many people, who were encouraged to just jump in and make it their own, with so many different crafts. We kind of had to let it go to see it jump into a whole other dimension. It’s tough to sum up. Going from something so private, to something involving so many people is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p><strong>How did working with Pig Iron Theatre affect the process?</strong></p>
<p>It was challenging in the best of ways. It was a different sense of performance. People are so fearless, just putting it all out there is really risky. Just going out there and not being afraid to try things and express themselves in the moment. Thats how they do it, they just try shit, and maybe they fall on their ass, or maybe they come up with something brilliant&#8230; but falling on your ass seems to be a big part of the process.</p>
<p>That just opens up so many creative portals &#8212; when you’re less inhibited, which at first for us was a little awkward. But we knew out of the gate that it was next level, by the end we gleaned so much positive influence.</p>
<p><strong>So did the inherent message of The Swamp change?</strong></p>
<p>Well even in our first meetings with Pig Iron they were asking us these really basic questions about the concepts and themes that we never even really had the need to define before, so that was really helpful itself.</p>
<p>If anything what The Swamp is or represents to us is just this free creative lens, like feeling as though you&#8217;re in control, but simultaneously passive as though you&#8217;re interacting with it.</p>

<p><strong>I actually listened to the new <em>Psychedelic Swamp</em> first, and just a few days ago found the old one online somewhere.  It was kind of a crazy way to view the concept.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, its been kind of hard to communicate the two chapter element of it to some people at shows or in interviews. Some people think were just taking our first album and re-making it to make it better, but the concept was that we received this tape and we eventually were going to have to interpret it at some point. We knew when we finished that tape that it was a crazy weird thing, that was different than what we were even doing at that time.  But we knew we were going to do it again, just pumping it through a very different, popular music lens.</p>
<p><strong>Did you guys think you succeeded in interpreting Phrases&#8217; message?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I do. We don&#8217;t have any delusions about this being a concise package, but that&#8217;s kind of the nature of The Swamp. It&#8217;s kind of about operating with a certain creative lens, and letting themes prevail.  There&#8217;s really no wrong way to interpret the whole thing, which we know its kind of convoluted but it kept it really free.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like going back to interpret some of the music? For example, &#8220;Fire On My Back&#8221; is very different.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of it comes from just thirty second clips, and just expanding upon it. But that one was just one we were really into and it got a whole new chord structure.  But we had to really remake it to make it a pop song. it was kind of like &#8220;anything goes&#8221; because we didn&#8217;t really have a connection to the material as if were a new song being brought in. So anyone could go to any instrument or throw out any idea, and any way of capturing it in the studio.  It was really open.</p>
<p><strong>How are the songs working in the live shows?</strong></p>
<p>Great!  It was a little slow at first. We started the tour playing a lot of the songs, which was before the record came out, so a lot of people didn&#8217;t really know them. It kind of seemed like it was slowing the show down.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re slowly working them back in. The more the people know the stuff, the more we can get back in there. Looking back it seems that every tour from every album kind of shifts what we do live.  The same goes for this record. It also affects how we play older stuff. It’s starting to feel like it&#8217;s fusing together.</p>
<p><strong>You guys have a lot of dog lyrics in your songs. Is that something that you and Toby do conceptually, or is it just fun for you? Or is it a subconscious thing?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not conscious.  If anything, it&#8217;s like a common thing that we love dogs. Something about the essence and spirit of your average domestic dog that we&#8217;ve always appreciated. Which probably led us to thinking that was a good band name to start with. There&#8217;s an earnestness and soulfulness and a loyalty. Dogs exude a simplicity and mindlessness and in someway our band has valued that balance. Devotion to a point of severity, but through a lens of fun and simple.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Old Black Hole&#8221; is a good example of how well crafted your tunes are.  Could you talk about writing that one?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that song was sort of the beginning of a realization I had in songwriting.  Among the many discoveries you have along the way, the things you realize about the craft, I had sort of entered into a phase where I was way more focused on the lyrics.</p>
<p>For years when I wrote I was so often solely focused on the chords and melody. I would just be using gibberish syllables. Once I had that figured out, I would plug the words in after, which can be hard because you can be leaning towards certain vowel sounds.</p>
<p>Over time I began to focus more on the lyrics which led me to an opposite approach &#8212; being totally content with the simplest melody in my head, because I always write lyrics while singing. &#8220;Old Black Hole&#8221; started as a a really simple, recycled country melody. Kind of hokey over simple chords, but once I had the words i could expand on it with variations on melody, and using minor chords and exploring the musicality of it.</p>
<p>It was a total excerise in that, and you can hear it in the song. The first part is over some re-contextualized chords, then after the bridge, its just rockin’ over those straight country chords. It is kind of like a relief because the melody just leads to those chords, like if you only heard the melody, your head would suggests those chords.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about your rig?</strong></p>
<p>I’m still using a Silvertone 1446&#8230; love that guitar! On this tour I&#8217;ve started using this amp &#8212; I&#8217;m so, so in love with it.</p>
<p>We’ve had it in the studio, but for some reason it never seemed like an acceptable tour amp. But I was kind of like, fuck it, why not, because its a Peavy. Basically, Peavy is taboo for janky shit. But the more you dig into them and go back to the late 60s and early 70s, they have some amazing shit. I’m playing a Peavy Vulcan, which is the very first solid-state amp they made. They made them from 69-72, and it&#8217;s rad. It sounds like what i want to hear and its a solid state amp &#8212; like the least sexy thing possible</p>
<p><strong>Are you still trying to push that edge of feedback sound?</strong></p>
<p>Big time. Weirdly, some of the early solid state stuff can do that better than some tube amps. It&#8217;s like of a different quality. Almost a warmer tone in some ways. I just love the early solid state amps, they have an aggressive, on the edge, sound. A lot of that feedback is having a hollow body guitar really loud, and some gnarly fuzz pedals. I feel like a solid state amp has a more transparent take on the pedals.</p>
<p><strong>I really like your tone, its on the edge of chaos at all times but you do a really good job of controlling it.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, man.  That&#8217;s part of the reason I&#8217;m running all over the stage. I gotta get away from my amp. If I let a note ring out, I gotta get away from the amp because it&#8217;s just screaming.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s a song you always wanted to cover?</strong></p>
<p>“A Whiter Shade of Pale”, and we’ve been talking about doing this Bob Marley cover, “Chances Are” from his doo-wop days, kinda pre-reggae. “Love in Vain” from <em>Street Legal</em>, I’ve recorded versions of it in my house, and man that song is really doin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for Dr. Dog?</strong></p>
<p>We’re gonna try to bring Swamp Is On to some more cities, we’re working on getting funding and all that stuff, and the theatre side to that. Hopefully by summer we’ll have another set up in Boston or D.C. or something like that. Then we’ll be getting to work on a new album, we&#8217;ve got some of that we’ve already worked on.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-29526" href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/review-setlist-american-babies-schubas-tavern-21816-29525.html/screen-shot-2016-02-24-at-5-18-50-pm"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29526" src="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-02-24-at-5.18.50-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-24 at 5.18.50 PM" width="624" height="347" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Songwriting is a mathematical equation rooted in art &#8212; and it blows my mind.  To the layman, it evolves coding and decoding, instant translation and digestion, and the courage to present a final product as something worthy of consumption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Hamilton seems to embrace these concepts for entire albums&#8230; and even tours.  Painstakingly assembling tracks exactly how he wants them, in a way that follows the formula. Then he finds musicians to take that material and tour. There are plenty of points of failure in that process, but Hamilton has seemingly mastered his own version</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his present tour, he may have done it with possibly the best supporting cast I’ve seen him perform his own material with.  What do we call this version of the American Babies? 4.2?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A revamped lineup has coalesced over the past 2 years.  Hamilton’s Winter &#8217;16 Babies includes additional guitarists Raina Mullen and Justin Mazer, bassist Mark Sosnoskie and drummer Al Smith. Everyone sings. This is the lineup that swung into Chicago at Schuba’s last Thursday as part of the Dunn Dunn Fest, a celebration of American music.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had the pleasure of <a href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-interview-with-tom-hamilton-29473.htmlern-21816-29525.html">speaking with Hamilton prior</a> to this vist and &#8212; I’ll admit &#8212; the task of connecting with an artist in advance of a show can sometimes overpower the senses when you&#8217;ve finally arrived in the same room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve also seen enough mutations and reboots of band lineups that nostalgia rarely prevents me from accepting lineup tinkering and substitutions, conflicts of interest, creative differences, touring issues, and stylistic shifts. Though sometimes, the contrary proves true: the new iteration of a band just won&#8217;t hit the mark (I&#8217;m looking at your latter-day Trey Anastasio Band). Potentially this points to material, and to that point, I’ve really dug Hamilton&#8217;s evolution from album to album.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went into the evening expecting good, but walked away with great, and an ear that’s still ringing. A frothed up crowd supported these opinions, including delirious dancing from at least one individual who demanded a 8&#215;10 parcel of real estate to support his headstands and forward rolls to the Babie&#8217;s soundtrack….I shit you not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two openers, and a steady stream of people that arrived early enough to catch both local Chicago groups &#8212; Grood and Melk &#8212; and the intimate Schuba’s was tightly packed by the time the Babies took the stage for their 90 minute set. I think Tom’s outgrown the Tonic Rooms of the city (editor&#8217;s note&#8230; Tom returns to the Tonic Room on May 14th!), no doubt partially due to popularity overflowing from his JRAD noteriety. But shows like this show there is so much more to Hamilton than being 20% of that game changing cover band.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The excitement of being on the road with HIS thing was reinforced all night. His growth in confidence, exuberance and talent as a leader are apparent, while his ability to allow his ego to get out of the way and especially allow Mazer’s Telecaster shine in guitar “pong”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two guitarists volleyed six-string lightning bolts back and forth mischievously &#8212; urging one another into wave after powerful wave of sound. Hamilton’s found a complementary player &#8212; I&#8217;m guessing many more folks will know his name in five years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbelievably, Mazer is only 26, but Hamilton’s coaching brings out nothing but rightfully deserved moments to shine and peaks to demolish. It clicked during that night&#8217;s version of “What Does it Mean to Be?” for me.  Simultaneously raw and capable, it the Hamilton / Mazer concoction left many jaws on the floor when the refrain kicked back in. I’m going to think it was due to the title of </span><a href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-interview-with-tom-hamilton-29473.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Tom, that he made that that song the exclamation point to deliver the group’s potential.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton used the ability to own and orchestrate, push and cultivate like a head chef empowering his kitchen staff. Raina Mullen &#8211;whose moving story of working at the Capitol Theater in NY, crossing paths with Hamilton, and pushing her demo &#8212; yielded the fruitful exchange of his services of producing her EP for her touring as the Babies’ female vocalist. That is amazing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Mazer’s guitar work, Mullen balanced and framed Hamilton’s vocals, and proved that the translation of the songwriting code in his head is a thing of art. Less dominating of a stage presence, Mullen was equally important for adding tone and richness to the Babies’ typically male-dominated touring outfit. Laying the background work, Sosnoskie and Smith were machines, and provided a not-overlooked foundation, without front and center fanfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may have been more sexy names associated with the American Babies in the past, but his specific outfit’s chemistry is apparent, and deserving of time to grow.  With more material to learn, and audiences to reach and please, I hope they get the chance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was obvious in the grin accompanying Tom’s face while discussing the gig post-show, just where he’s at with the Babies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lighter JRAD schedule in 2016 could lend to Hamilton’s projects getting more attention and energy. I’m interested in how he hones this incarnation and continues to fine tune their live material, making them the household name they deserve to be.. </span></p>

<p>AC/DC sold out the United Center on Wednesday night for their “Rock Or Bust” tour. Though the tour is named after their most recent album, the band primarily performed their hits, opting to play only four songs recorded after 1981, the inarguable end of the band’s height.</p>
<p>As one expects from a group with the legendary status of AC/DC, the show rocked.</p>
<p>The band stood on an intense stage setup, with stacks of amplifiers lining the back of the stage and a massive, lit-up, devil-horned semi-circle nearly reaching the gigantic venue’s ceiling. There were video screens, pyrotechnics, inflatable naked women, a full runway and plenty of other tricks throughout.</p>
<p>Vendors sold the generally middle-aged fans overpriced plastic devil horns with blinking red lights, which blinked on and off throughout the audience as the lights dimmed. Before the band took the stage, the massive screens showed an animated film of terrified astronauts running for their lives on a distant planet, an explosion of fire eventually revealing the band’s name in the extraterrestrial terrain.</p>
<p>Then the band ran on stage from behind their massive stacks of amplifiers, the ear-splitting volume of opener “Rock Or Bust” drowning out the roaring cheers of the thousands of fans now standing at their seats.</p>
<p>This is what arena-rock is supposed to be. This is, quite simply, a <em>show</em>.<a rel="attachment wp-att-29505" href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/review-setlist-video-acdc-united-center-21716-29504.html/img_8600"><img class=" size-large wp-image-29505 aligncenter" src="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8600-770x578.jpg" alt="IMG_8600" width="770" height="578" /></a><a rel="attachment wp-att-29505" href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/?attachment_id=29505"></a></p>
<p>The band is old, of course, with singer Brian Johnson now 68 years old and guitarist Angus Young having recently hit 60. Yet the band played beyond competence, Johnson’s strained, upper-register vocals still offering the gritty urgency that made the band famous and Young’s proficient guitar playing still rocking harder than almost any modern band.</p>
<p>With a whole arsenal of classics to choose from, the band designed the setlist with fans in mind, surrounding new song “Got Some Rock &amp; Roll Thunder” with fan-favorites “Back In Black” and “Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.”</p>
<p>The band’s energy was unstoppable, a reminder of the spirit of good-old-fashioned rock &amp; roll that AC/DC always possessed and exemplified.</p>
<p>“Hells Bells” featured a colossal bell lowered slowly from the ceiling, rocking back and forth, as though in time with the audience’s endless cheers. “You Shook Me All Night Along” highlighted the band’s blues-based beginnings, its riffs and soloing as classic as classic-rock has ever sounded.</p>
<p>The band kept picking up steam through the end of the set, with “T.N.T.” and “Whole Lotta Rosie” feeding the screaming fans exactly what they wanted.</p>
<p>Yet a band like AC/DC wouldn’t leave stage without a bang.</p>
<p>The band stepped back at the conclusion of the epic “Let There Be Rock,” leaving Angus on guitar performing a breakneck-speed solo. He runs to the end of the stage’s runway, which nearly reaches the center of the venue’s floor seating. With a spotlight on the soloing artist, a small circle where he stands begins to rise into the air, eventually lifting the guitarist roughly 20 feet upward.</p>
<p>At least five minutes into his solo, Angus is high in the air and shows no signs of slowing down. Massive confetti cannons shoot upward from below him, the guitarist disappearing momentarily in the multi-colored paper. As the runway lowers back to ground level, Angus takes off running, disappearing behind stage only to appear atop the stack of amplifiers, running across them and continuing to solo. Angus reappears on stage and ends the song to roaring applause.</p>
<p>There’s only one possible way the band could maintain this energy into the encore: “Highway To Hell.”</p>
<p>The band ripped through their performance of the classic with unparalleled energy. Despite having played the song for almost 40 years, AC/DC sounds fresh and invigorated. As though to confirm their steadfast dedication to their music genre, the band closes with concert-staple “For Those About To Rock (We Salute You),” finishing a 20-song setlist that didn’t slow down for a single minute.</p>
<p>Though AC/DC’s United Center performance was, by all means, nostalgic, the band managed to avoid being campy or gimmicky, and, especially in regards to the level of musicianship, offered a glimpse of what made their performances so shocking and infamous in the 70s. It’s Rock &amp; Roll, intentionally capitalized. It’s loud. It’s energetic. It’s a <em>show</em>. It’s AC/DC.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">What Does It Mean to Be?: An Interview with Tom Hamilton</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Tom Hamilton returns to Chicago this week at one of the city&#8217;s most perfect venue, Schuba’s, for a Thursday night show. [We&#8217;re giving away some tickets&#8230; <a href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/win-tickets-to-dunn-dunn-fest-29459.html">So go grab yourself some</a>].</p>
<p>By now, his -name should be familiar. You’ve possibly seen him with his chameleon-like Americana outfit, the American Babies, a version of which he&#8217;ll be performing with this week. &nbsp;Or, perhaps you&#8217;re aware of one of his more electronic-leaning outfits: &nbsp;Brothers Past or the supergroup Electron. &nbsp;Just as likely, you may have hear of his Dead offshoots like Billy and the Kids or intrepid interpreters&nbsp;Joe Russo’s Almost Dead.</p>
<p>The Barn caught up with Tom to promo his fifth American Babies release ( on the Royal Potato Family label). He approaches his life and craft with conviction, and has no confusion on his place as an artist, writer, or musical coach. He wants to push the envelope, challenge himself, his band, and the audience. Just what I want from a musician.</p>
<p><b>We talked about two years ago, and I give you a lot of credit, because at the time you were a little hesitant to answer. But I asked where you saw the Babies and Tom Hamilton in 3-5 years, and you offered a response that has turned out to be kind of prophetic. &nbsp;You said that you’ve made these things happen in your career. You’ve also alluded to wanting the Babies to take on this adaptive form, a liquid genre and style, and allow the band to channel music to create something that’s not comforting, and can really go anywhere.</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I think this stuff really translates well, or it has so far. It’s just really exciting.</p>
<p><b>It’s hard to not read into the album’s title, <i>Epic Battle Between Light and Dark. &nbsp;</i>Understanding your background and handling depression, is your songwriting how you deal and cope with those sorts of challenges in your life?</b></p>
<p>No. You know, the songs are an after effect of dealing with things. It’s never like, I am feeling X way, and I’m going to write about it. When I’m writing, it’s a pretty gradual process, where I will take take a lengthy amount of time to collect ideas, to collect little small thoughts, and when that stack of papers gets a little taller, I’ll start to dig into it and see what’s there.</p>
<p>It’s never that I had this experience on the bus today and I’m gonna write about it. I just kind of take little notes until that pile gets to a place where I’m ready to go through it, and say, &#8220;well&#8230;what does all this mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelangelo would go in and stare at this big block of granite everyday for like six months. Like he would just sit there and stare at it for hours at a time, and people would be like “what the fuck are you doing?”, and he would be like “I’m working!”.</p>
<p>He would think&#8230;I got this thing, and what am I gonna make out of it? And ultimately he would think, I’m going to stare at it and work at it until I turn it into the statue of David. It’s kind of like that, where it’s all these pieces and fragments that I pick up over the course of time, I will stop and take them all and say, what can I make out them today, can I make something and do they make sense together?</p>
<p>Most times, it&#8217;s all just random bullshit and I’ll go on with my life. &nbsp;But other times, they turn into songs. If someone gives you a stack of legos or a piece of clay, those little ideas either make something or they don’t. I just need to figure out how to make something beautiful out of them.</p>
<p><b>So the experiences make you, and it’s not something conscious as much as just getting weaved into the fabric of how you interpret that lego block or clay. &nbsp;It gets translated into whatever piece it is you construct?</b></p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;you know when I was making this record, and going through all of this stuff, one way we could go here is I could talk&#8230;about&#8230;this….and you know, if I kept going, I am sure I could have turned the source material into something else, but this is the place I want it to go. And once that decision gets made, it’s kind of easier to move forward. Those things aren’t a source of anything, that’s just my day to day life, and everything else is a byproduct of that.</p>
<p><b>So how did you go into <i>An Epic Battle Between Light and Dark</i>? Can you fill in the gaps around the band you put together to play the material live, who you brought in and why, and the creative process of making this album?</b></p>
<p>Well Pete Tramo owns the studio that I recorded <i>Knives and Teeth</i> in. And we just got along really well making that record. I knew it was going to be a little time before I was ready to write and record, but I knew it was going to be Pete. So we took a lot of my downtime, unfortunately, which isn’t that much.</p>
<p>But, we’d just spend time in the studio, hanging out, working with gear, and understanding what every nook and cranny of the studio sounded like, just so we knew sonically what our pieces of clay were going to be, what were all the possibilities that we had. You know, in there (the studio), we were thinking we could start working on a record, and I had this pile of stuff, and we just started going through it.</p>
<p>We started thinking a lot of this stuff could be steered towards this one topic, and the more we would talk about our personal lives and the things we struggled with, certain things that we’ve fortunately put behind us, it just started to make sense. You see a sign pointing a certain direction once or twice, and you think oh well that’s a coincidence, but after that you can’t really keep ignoring the signs, it just made sense for us to go in that direction.</p>
<p><b><a rel="attachment wp-att-29477" href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-interview-with-tom-hamilton-29473.html/leather"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29477" src="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/wp-content/uploads/leather.png" alt="leather" width="622" height="415"></a></b></p>
<p><b>Are these pieces that were plucked from the time after <i>Knives and Teeth</i>, or from an era before?</b></p>
<p>You know, a lot of the stuff was a bit of a guide. You thought of this one day, so don’t forget about that&#8230;you know&#8230;</p>
<p><b>So does that blow up creatively, where these dots suddenly get connected, and it exposes and opens these other doors in that process?</b></p>
<p>Yes, exactly. This line&#8230;what this line mean when you put it with this one, and does it change it if you put it with this one&#8230;well let’s expand on that. Musically it would just kind of go. You know really it was put together in the last year when we were really writing. but there were like 1 or 2 songs, you know like there’s a song, “Bring it In Close”, the seed of that one I’ve have for about 5 years or so.</p>
<p>When we were throwing everything at the wall to see what stuck, that was one of the demos I found that I would ask Pete, &#8220;what do you think of this tune?&#8221; And Pete really loved it, it totally fits, and he said you know we should see if we can follow that one somewhere special. You know for the most part though, we went into this with completely open ears and minds, just thinking, “what can we do?” It’s a long process and we just enjoy the process of getting there.</p>
<p><b>So that’s the Pete and Tom picture, but where do the existing road and live band of the Babies come in? Were you looking to fill specific sounds, voices or personalities?</b></p>
<p>Well you know for the record, it was mostly me and Peter for most of the time. There were a couple of instances where we had a couple of demos where we’d be like, okay, let’s see what this one would sound like with a band. We’d call a band in and boil through a couple tunes and get a vibe and see what would work and what didn’t. But for the most part, it was just figuring things out.</p>
<p>I mean, I play a lot of instruments, and for me, it’s just working things out. I try to think of every possibility. I try to make rational decisions. I would try to get the songs where I could get them, and at the end of the day, if that’s not where I wanted to be….</p>
<p>A song like “What’s It Mean to Be” is a really cool groovy tune, with a lot of sexiness to it, and Peter and I were working out the demos to it, and we discovered we couldn’t get the groove we wanted just by ourselves. So it’s like, “let’s bring in a rhythm section”, so we brought in Al (Smith), and it worked out from there. We did the basic tracks&#8230;drums and guitar, and we’d go through it live. You know, it wasn’t like “Synth Driver”, where I just pieced it together, instrument by instrument, and I did the whole song front to back. It all really just depended on what the track needed.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-29478" href="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-interview-with-tom-hamilton-29473.html/diner"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29478" src="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/wp-content/uploads/diner.png" alt="diner" width="501" height="499"></a></p>
<p><b>And that’s how recording became who you’d use for the road?</b></p>
<p>Yeah, so Al’s been with us (as our drummer) since like August of 2014, then on guitar is Justin Mazer, and he came in around the same time or just after Al, and I’ve been flipping around bass players for a while, and we got a guy named Mark Susnowsky, who’s a guy from Pennsylvania, who&#8217;s just a mellow type of dude who really fits in.</p>
<p>Then most recently with Raina Mullen, while I was producing an EP for her, right as I was writing and recording this record. I’ve always had a female singer on my records. So the deal we had worked out, was I would produce her EP if you record the vocal tracks on my record, and it went really well. So when it came down to start playing, it just kind of made sense to bring her along as the vocalist and acoustic guitarist&#8230;because I just kind of got tired with the guitar/keyboard thing.</p>
<p>So many bands are the same band, you know, so let’s try to switch it up, so it’s 2 electric guitars, an acoustic, bass and drums, and four of us sing, and it’s a really cool and interesting sonic palette. I think people really respond to it.</p>
<p><b>So you’ve done Jam Cruise and recently an Americana cruise called Cayamo with this outfit? No disrespect to the jam world, but you’re associated with that scene. Everyone knows you. But to be included and invited on a cruise like that has to be the utmost compliment&#8230;how did that come about? And you had some pretty interesting sit ins with Steve Earle and others for a Dead tribute…</b></p>
<p>Oh man, yeah, it was Steve (Earle), Buddy Miller, Larry and Teresa Campbell, Jim Lauderdale, David Bromberg, Sam Lewis&#8230;just some real heavy Nashville cats….and I really don’t even know how it came to pass, you know. I just got an email from my agent saying do you want to go, and right away I was like, of course!</p>
<p>Honestly, the only name I needed to see was John Prine. I grew up listening to John Prine and I love the band, I saw that he was the headliner, and I was like, “I’m there!”. I didn’t really need to know anything else at that point, but as it was coming up, they wanted me to put together a Dead set with some of the headliners, and we were like, certainly, if the headliners want to do this, we’d certainly be the house band for it.</p>
<p>So then, it was like, yeah, Buddy Miller would do a couple of songs….alright cool&#8230;and Jim Lauderdale wants to do a couple&#8230;ok, far out….Oh, and Steve Earle wants to jump in and do “I Know You Rider”&#8230;and it was like this is turning into something cool, and in the end it just kind of turned into what it turned into&#8230;an incredible experience! I give the band all the credit&#8230;I mean, I’ve been playing this music my whole life, and also intensely the last couple years, so I know this stuff like the back of my hand.</p>
<p>I mean my band didn’t have this stuff in the bag, they’re all younger, they didn’t necessarily grow up with this shit. They all busted their asses and learned this stuff and it was really great!</p>
<p><b>And going on a cruise as opposed to truck stops and driving in the middle of the night through Dubuque, IA had to have been a great way to get the band tightly knit in a relaxing environment…</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it was a great bonding experience. But anytime you go on the road it’s a tight bonding experience. You go on the road and you get tighter as a group. We get to share that with one another. But you know, it’s kind of one in the same&#8230;</p>
<p><b>I read in another interview that George Carlin&#8217;s way of writing comedy &#8212; in the way he would redefine his stand up act annually, rewriting his act every year &#8212; was an inspiration for you. How do you take a band which grew in the studio on the road and start from scratch? Is that Carlin statement a model for how you approach your material and your band?</b></p>
<p>Well you know, first it came from doing the album. It came from subject matter and sonic palette. So let’s try to do something different and dig a little deeper than we did last time, and talk about some different shit. From there, it’s never really a conscious decision to flip the band as I’ll call it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people don’t like change very much. Which is confusing to me. Kind of what it comes down to is, if people don’t like change&#8230;it’s kind of like<i> Flawed Logic</i>. I do that album, and I put it out, and I get some people in and they learn that, and we go out and we perform that stuff and some new stuff. And then I come back in and I write <i>Knives and Teeth</i>, and people are like, well, this is not quite like what the last record was, I don’t know if I’m as into it&#8230;and OK.</p>
<p>People want something very rigid, or well defined things.. And that’s not me, that’s not who I am or how I am. I don’t like things so structured, or black and white. So when it comes down to flipping the band, it comes down to the people that are in it when I flip the band, they’re not into changing or learning new things.</p>
<p>Look man, I know you are good at playing this one style of thing, but what are we going to do, keep writing that same style of thing so you can show off how good you are at it? No, what I like to do, is have a group of people and finding what they’re very good at, and also finding out what they’re awful at, and writing accordingly. I’m going to write a song, or a style of song that you are going to suck at, so that you can learn to get better at it. For myself as well.</p>
<p>I write things or say things, that I don’t want to say or write. But that&#8217;s challenging yourself thing. What are we going to do, keep doing the same safe bullshit my entire life? That’s stupid. I’m not Bono. I’m no superstar. I’m making these records, because I want to make something good, and I want to make something that follows my code. I don’t want to sit there and crank out bullshit and sound like the dickhead from Coldplay!</p>

<p>An unusual reunion occurred at Clive Davis’s annual pre-Grammys gala on Sunday night as the surviving members of Nirvana were joined by Beck for a performance of David Bowie’s “The Man Who Sold The World.”</p>
<p>Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear performed a fairly straightforward version of the track, musically, while Beck’s vocals take the spotlight, eventually leading to a ghostly outro.</p>
<p>Nirvana famously performed the track on <em>MTV Unplugged</em>, while Beck has always been vocal about his admiration of Bowie, having covered “Diamond Dogs” over a decade ago.</p>
<p>Watch video of the performance below and read Beck&#8217;s moving essay written for Rolling Stone regarding David Bowie&#8217;s legacy and influence <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beck-on-david-bowie-he-s-always-been-a-guidepost-for-me-20160128">here.</a></p>

<p>Relentlessly touring Chicago based blues-rock outfit The Steepwater Band is set to release its first new record in four years, and the first since they added guitarist Eric Saylors.</p>
<p>While this spring will find them touring heavily in their &#8220;home-away-from-home&#8221; in Western Europe, it won&#8217;t be before getting a proper send off from their hometown.</p>
<p>They play Chicago&#8217;s 1st Ward / Chop Shop on April 2nd with friends Davey Knowles and Edward David Anderson to celebrate the record&#8217;s release the day before.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they&#8217;re still touring their Stones cover set throughout the Midwest.  As this first single from the new album proves, there&#8217;s plenty of Stones swagger in their new material.  Here&#8217;s &#8220;Shake Your Faith&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
