Like "<a href="http://www.nlen.org/">North Lawndale Employment Network</a>" and "tea".  Next Friday, that pairing won't sound so strange. (And thanks to North Lawndale Employment Network for giving us the heads-up)

Like many other Chicago neighborhoods, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lawndale,_Chicago">North Lawndale</a> was an industrial center that drove economic growth. Now, with many unemployed and underemployed residents, the neighborhood faces challenges which the North Lawndale Employment Network faces on a daily basis.  <a href="http://www.beelovebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/NLENInfogrfx2016.pdf" target="_blank">Programs that cover a diverse range of interests</a> - from financial literacy to building bridges between ex-offenders and police.  North Lawndale Employment Network even runs its own social enterprise called Sweet Beginnings LLC (which produces<a href="http://www.beelovebuzz.com/" target="_blank"> beelove-branded products</a>), providing people much-needed job training and skills while crafting unique products that are sold throughout the city.

Next Friday, February 19th, North Lawndale Employment Network will sponsor its 11th Annual Sweet Beginnings Tea event at the Imperial Ballroom of the <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/chicago/" target="_blank">Fairmont Hotel</a>, located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LHWwivaxDUG2" target="_blank">200 North Columbus Drive in Chicago</a>. Focusing on "creating a community that works", the event will be emceed by Chicago news veteran <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinRobinson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Robin Robinson</a>.

One of the highlights will be presenting Bob Mariano, President, CEO and Chairman of Roundy's, with the <strong>Voice of the Voiceless Award. </strong>Mr. Mariano has demonstrated strong support of Sweet Beginnings LLC.  Not only can you find its  products at <a href="http://www.marianos.com/" target="_blank">Mariano's</a>, but he has also worked to provide employment opportunities and second chances for returning citizens.

The February 19th event will also highlight organizations that win NLEN's <strong>Creating A Community</strong> <strong>That Works</strong> <strong>Award, </strong>which includes<strong>
</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Retired Chicago Police Department First Deputy Alfonza Wysinger and interim Superintendent John Escalante accepting, for their advocacy of NLEN's <a href="http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2015/12/22/police-officers-former-inmates-break-bread-build-bridges" target="_blank">Building Bridges, Building Connections program</a>, which was designed to address the tensions between police and community, to foster understanding and to change the way that African American citizens and police engage with each other.</li>
	<li>Allstate SVP of Corporate Relations Victoria Dinges, who is accepting the award on Allstate's behalf. Allstate has been active in driving positive chance through youth empowerment programs, as well as programs that promote safety and prevent domestic violence.  By supporting these and other NLEN programs like U-Turn Permitted Program, Allstate not only plays a direct role in community building...but also strengthens its organizational core.</li>
	<li>Cook County Commissioner Robert Steele, for his dynamic leadership and unwavering commitment to the citizens he serve, as well as allowing Sweet Beginnings to expand its beehives into the Cook County Forest Preserve.</li>
</ul>
Registration for the event begins at 2:30 pm, and the event lasts from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm. For more details and to register, visit <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nlentea" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/NLENTEA</a>.

The reason we call this segment "Meet Your Neighbor" is that we like to highlight some of the great work going on in the city. Next week, at least, you'll get to meet your neighbor in person....and get to know North Lawndale Employment Network much better.

I am a registered voter in the state of Illinois, a proud resident of the city of Chicago, and <a title="I Served As Judge for the Chicago Primary Election" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2015/02/chicago-primary-election-judg/" target="_blank">an election judge</a>. So I write this as someone qualified to reach out to you, and more importantly, someone whose opinion you should value.

Because quite honestly, you're doing a <em>really</em> poor job in governing the citizens of Illinois. For all the cynics who claim that you bought your term as Illinois Governor, well...<em>
</em>

....I hope you got what you paid for.

First, there's the six months plus in terms of the budget stalemate. Although, yes, y<a href="http://abc7chicago.com/politics/progress-made-on-il-budget-stalemate-rauner-says/1128422/" target="_blank">ou did mention some possible thawing in December</a>...we haven't moved forward. You claim that it all boils down to resistance to your "reforms" in Springfield - that legislators aren't willing to simply give way to your ideas.

But two of your most recent decisions...have me concerned. So much so that I'm wondering if we can add your name to that "recall Rahm Emanuel" bill being pursued in the state's legislature.

First, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/chi-rauner-social-services-20150404-story.html" target="_blank">your suspension of funding for social services</a> is....well, the kind of behavior I would expect from someone who purchased (rather than earned) his political position. And yes, for me it's personal - my mother, who has various health issues, depends on some of those programs. My cousin, who is autistic, is also a beneficiary. Quite honestly, many people throughout the state are suffering, and you're basically throwing them a royal curve ball.

(Now, before you complain that I'm being Chicago-centric, let me point out that you're hurting people in the Metro East area - that's the area across the river from St. Louis, Missouri - as well as in southern Illinois. So if many of your wealthier constituents are congratulating you on your "strong fiscal leadership".....your less-than-fortunate ones are condemning you for your lack of empathy. Yes, the money has to come from somewhere...but you've shortchanged the majority of your voters. That's <em>not</em> a sign of smart, powerful leadership).

But <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-republicans-cps-bankruptcy-met-20160119-story.html">your move to push legislation that would allow state control of the Chicago Public School system</a>....well, I get it.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/18/us/flint-michigan-water-crisis-five-things/"> Another midwestern Republican governor did the same thing with some success</a>....but right now, that move has some <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/political-fallout-flint-michigan-water-crisis-spreads-015602477.html" target="_blank">very negative political and social repercussions for that state.</a>

And not to put too fine a point on it....but that <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160121/BLOGS02/160129967/rauner-pension-reform-move-blows-up" target="_blank">recent "pension reform" statement you made is backfiring</a>. You might want to reconsider your overall leadership strategy.

Now, being governor isn't like, say, being an investment banker. In the private sector, you <em>can</em> take charge, easily shift funding, etc, because it only affects your immediate business. Many of the decisions you made in the business center rarely - if ever - affected the greater community.

But as Governor, those same tactics <em>are</em> affecting the state of Illinois. You can't just take over a school system - messed up as it is - because you think you can do better. You need to work <em>within</em> the system <em>with</em> your peers and colleagues....because your decisions affect the lives of <em>every</em> resident of Illinois.  Knowing the problems our state was facing - and having an eyes wide open perspective - you sought and campaigned for the role in which to fix these problems.

Good leadership - especially when driving social good and community benefit - isn't about assuming that you know best and your way wins. Strong political leadership is similar to strong business leadership in that great leaders act from a set of principles and get buy-in. Granted, both Chicago and Illinois have very entrenched factions and practitioners, but so do many businesses. Working to build consensus can be tough, but it's possible - if you don't believe me, <a href="http://www.jimcollins.com/" target="_blank">Jim Collins</a> wrote <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/media/198193/good-to-great" target="_blank">an entire book based on that premise</a>.

Unfortunately, though, I think it's too late: you seem to be like many other Illinois governors who prioritized their personal interests over those of the state. I am tempted to end this blog post with a cheap shot like "You're acting like Rod Blagojevich with a better haircut"...but I believe I can end this on a more professional, respectful note.

And I'm open to a rebuttal - you're more than welcome to have one of your staff <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/about/" target="_blank">reach out to me via e-mail</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OneCauseAtATimeCNow/" target="_blank">this blog's Facebook page</a>. You could even leave a comment below - I moderate comments, and will not tolerate trolls. But I say all of this not because I'm a "hater", as younger people might say, but because I love the great state of Illinois - and the great city of Chicago - and I needed to express my concerns.

Thanks for reading!

I have featured various organizations, discussed various resources, and started conversations about community and mission-driven organizations. But there's one thing I haven't done in this blog....and I'm kicking off 2016 by soliciting your feedback.

My main question for Chicago nonprofits and social enterprise is this: <strong>what are the biggest challenges for your business or organization? </strong>

Much of this was inspired by a <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/challenges-facing-nonprofit-marketers-in-2016" target="_blank">seemingly innocuous Hubspot article about marketing challenges</a>....but it made me realize that, as a community-minded  blogger, I had overlooked a key factor in my writing.

I <em>never</em> solicited community input to determine where to focus my writing - yes, I did encourage people to join our Facebook group and subscribe to our e-mail newsletter. I was willing to accept solicitations for coverage....but did I ever ask for them? If I did, I don't remember....and that's not a good thing.

Look beneath Chicago's prevalent startup culture, and you'll find a variety of nonprofits and social enterprises (as well as other organizations) doing some <em>really</em> critical work in building the Chicago community. Work that integrates technology in ways that make a huge, positive impact on our city. It is rarely, if ever, given a public spotlight. My goal for 2016 is to change that - this year, I want to focus as much on the hidden treasures within Chicago's social change community as much as the organizations doing the most public work.

On this blog, there's room for both corporate volunteering <em>and</em> smaller, more grassroots-oriented efforts. There's also room to explore some of the challenges <em>all</em> social change agents face, and this blog considers both nonprofits <em>and</em> social enterprise key allies in rebuilding the Chicago community. Despite a year of high political drama, with so much uncertainty, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time" target="_blank"><strong>One Cause At A Time</strong></a> needs to play a role in building its own community, and part of that is being aware and addressing those challenges directly, providing resources and insight that can help Chicago nonprofits and social enterprise meet those challenges head-on.

So I'm asking <em>you</em>, the reader who works for a Chicago nonprofit or social enterprise (and we don't discriminate between <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/forming-l3c-illinois" target="_blank">L3Cs</a> and <a href="http://www.mightybytes.com/blog/illinois-benefit-corporation-act/" target="_blank">Benefit Corporations</a>), to let us know what your biggest challenges are in working towards driving social change and community benefit in Chicago. (I will also be reaching out to my professional contacts as well, because like any nonprofit/social enterprise professional, I must continually educate myself on the present state of the field).

But how can Chicago professionals in nonprofits and social enterprise provide insight into the biggest challenges for their business/organization? There are a variety of ways to contact me, including

This blog values community input, and it's only right and proper that we ask for the challenges that Chicago nonprofits and social enterprise face on a daily basis. But the only way that we can provide great content is to know what's happening....and bring those issues to light.

Thanks again, and looking forward to 2016!

I have featured various organizations, discussed various resources, and started conversations about community and mission-driven organizations. But there's one thing I haven't done in this blog....and I'm kicking off 2016 by soliciting your feedback.

My main question for Chicago nonprofits and social enterprise is this: <strong>what are the biggest challenges for your business or organization? </strong>

Much of this was inspired by a <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/challenges-facing-nonprofit-marketers-in-2016" target="_blank">seemingly innocuous Hubspot article about marketing challenges</a>....but it made me realize that, as a community-minded  blogger, I had overlooked a key factor in my writing.

I <em>never</em> solicited community input to determine where to focus my writing - yes, I did encourage people to join our Facebook group and subscribe to our e-mail newsletter. I was willing to accept solicitations for coverage....but did I ever ask for them? If I did, I don't remember....and that's not a good thing.

From a highly contested mayoral race to protests around police conduct, from library hotspots to startups, there have been a variety of ways in which residents, nonprofits, and social enterprises have enabled social change and social benefit in Chicago. In fact, many cultural aspects within and outside of Chicago have reinforced the idea that advocating for communities goes beyond the clever social media graphic, and that technology can drive greater opportunities for social change.

In fact, one of the things you'll be seeing over the next few weeks are some changes in the blog - not a shift in focus as much as changes in layout. Many of our subpages and features will be better organized. We'll be sure to post on a more consistent basis.

But one thing will never change: we'll still cover aspects of nonprofit, social enterprise, and community organization activity in Chicago. After all, looking at 2015 in review, it's safe to say - we've found our niche and hit our stride.

<b>August -  </b><i><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2015/08/follow-up-2015-chicago-cares-serve-a-thon/">Recently, I participated in Chicago Cares Serve-A-Thon 2015, and although I wrote about the experience, I don't think my prose did the event justice.</a> </i>

<b>September - </b><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2015/09/open-letter-last-week-tonight/" target="_blank"><i>But my main purpose is to congratulate you on being named "America's Social Justice Warrior" by Mashable - the tech site that reflects America's taste in potatoes</i></a>

<b>October - </b><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2015/10/blog-action-day-2015/" target="_blank"><i>In our current media culture - and especially in Chicago - we're rather indifferent to the power of blogging, and that needs to change. Immediately</i></a>

<b>November -  </b><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2015/11/winston-churchill-inspiration-for-social-change/" target="_blank"><em>"If you're going through hell, keep going"</em></a>

<b>December - </b><em><a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/one-cause-at-a-time/2015/12/help-carole-brown-crowdsource-support/" target="_blank">Too often, the idea of "crowdsourcing support" seems counter to the idea of "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps", or more towards "cyberbegging" than building support.</a></em>

In fact, one of the things you'll be seeing over the next few weeks are some changes in the blog - not a shift in focus as much as changes in layout. Many of our subpages and features will be better organized. We'll be sure to post on a more consistent basis.

But one thing will never change: we'll still cover aspects of nonprofit, social enterprise, and community organization activity in Chicago. After all, looking at 2015 in review, it's safe to say - we've found our niche and hit our stride.
Is there anything we've left out, or things we should cover in 2016?

To be honest, the past few weeks have been rough for me personally - family health issues have kept me busy, resulting in sudden changes in my schedule that have made it . At one point, I was fortunate enough to carve out some time to "sharpen the saw", as it were, and keep up on my professional reading. Knowing how many Chicago-area nonprofits and social enterprises are relying more on social media as a communications channel, I thought that reading a book that was highly recommended to me - Gary Vaynerchuk's <strong>Jab, Jab. Jab. Right Hook: How To Tell Your Story in a Noisy Social World</strong> - might be a great diversion.

And after I finished reading, <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</strong> <em>was</em> a worthwhile read....but I have some ambivalence about fully recommending it.

On the plus side, Vaynerchuk's book has some <em>really</em> strong ideas that any organization should adopt as part of their social media strategy: focusing on benefits rather than selling; telling a cohesive story; and understanding how placing strong content in the proper context can work wonders. <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</strong>'s central metaphor<strong> - </strong>providing relevant content that meets an audience's needs before going for an overt sell - seems a bit more belligerent than helpful. (It's not just about promoting a product or service...it's also about driving engagement with an audience, and finding those opportunities to build community). Perhaps my own bias is showing - I am so used to working in this field that many of these recommendations may be geared towards someone who is new to social media engagement, or who has not "seen and done it all".

(In other words, I may not be the target audience - or in the right frame of mind - most receptive to <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook)</strong>

Although Vaynerchuk has many great "best practices" of consumer brands using social media, much of the book feels more hype-driven than practical. For many mission-driven organizations like nonprofits or social enterprises, <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</strong>'s examples may seem out of reach, and the book's tone may be a bit overwhelming to casual readers. (For some examples, you may want to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GaryVaynerchuk" target="_blank">Vaynerchuk's YouTube channel</a>). The book has some very strong recommendations, and provides insight into how to engage audiences in our current media climate....but much of <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</strong> feels a bit too overenthusiastic, almost bludgeoning the reader into adopting every single recommendation as working policy.

Still, I am giving <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</strong> a very qualified recommendation - it's a great introductory book for nonprofits and social enterprises on how to approach social media strategy. However, checking <strong>Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</strong> out of the <a href="http://www.chipublib.org" target="_blank">Chicago Public Library</a> is a good strategy to read the book....and you can decide later whether to add it to your bookshelf. <strong> </strong>
