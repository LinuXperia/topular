She spent years looking for an out and finally escaped the cycle of prostitution with the help of police and started looking for a job. Without any real work experience or a resume, this proved to be a tall order.</p>Danesha, whose full name is being withheld to protect her identity, is now one of 47 women aged 18-25 that the Half Moon Bay-based non-governmental group Not For Sale is helping recover from years of trafficking and abuse.</p>Started in September 2014, the Reinvent program provides counseling and four weeks of training in resume writing, interview practice and other job skills. They also remove tattoos from women who were forcibly marked by their former exploiters.</p>The classroom sessions are held in a shared workspace, dubbed the Invention Hub, nestled in San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood. It’s home to Reinvent and a handful of small companies and social enterprises that rent the space, along with Dignitá, a coffee shop Not For Sale launched primarily to be a training ground for the Reinvent participants.</p>“It’s startups; it’s investment capital; it’s a social café setting, and it’s girls being rescued from trafficking,” said Dan Parodi, head of Dignitá.</p>Following four weeks in the classroom, trainees spend 12 weeks working at Dignitá before graduating from the program and seeking full-time employment. The position is paid and provides relevant, real-world experience for women who may have never held a steady job.</p>“Some of those basic skills of professionalism and decorum are things that they don’t have any experience in,” Parodi said. “So when we take girls into Dignitá as part of a training program, it really is an extension of the four-week job-readiness program and training that they’ve already had.”</p>Darian Eastman, Reinvent’s Youth Employment Specialist, connects program graduates with potential employers in the Bay Area. The program says it&#8217;s had a 70 percent success rate in placing graduates in companies like meal-delivery startup The Town Kitchen, handcrafted cardmaker Good Paper, coffee stand Chai Cart and nursery SF Foliage.</p>“There’s many barriers that they go through. The first barrier would be charges on their record, or not having any work experience at all, really not knowing what it is or what it takes to be an employee,” Eastman said. “And so we’ve got to kind of start from the ground up with things like that.”</p>Venus Rodriguez, the director of Reinvent, emphasized the importance of “re-education” for these women about themselves. “But it’s really about empowerment; letting them know that they’re just as capable as anyone else,” she said.</p>In the last half of 2014, there were 219 known and 72 suspected survivors of human trafficking in San Francisco, 224 of whom were women, according to a report issued in August by the Mayor’s Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking.</p>Sex trafficking is defined as commercial sex involving “force, fraud or coercion” when the victim is 18 or older. If the victim is under 18, any commercial sex act is considered sex trafficking.</p>Program administrators declined to make trainees available for comment saying many still feared for their safety.</p>Rodriguez said she works hard to address challenges that her trainees face head on. Sometimes trainees are less employable because they lack things most people take for granted, like professional clothing, transportation or a bank account.</p>“I have the bank come here and open bank accounts for them. There’s no, ‘Oh, I didn’t make it,’ or ‘I couldn’t go,’” Rodriguez said. “We’re going to do it right here, right now.”</p>Grant Rosen, a barista and trainer at Dignitá, has been working there since early 2015. Interacting with the trainees has helped him to see the world in a new light.</p>“It’s such a big issue that there needs to be somebody there to help along each step, and I think that’s a huge part of it,” Rosen said. “Dignitá plays a huge role in that one step &#8230; trying to get out of the life that they’ve been a part of.”</p>And when the Reinvent graduation ceremony takes place, Dignitá stays open so “people that would normally just wander in for a cup of coffee” have the chance to hear the incredible true stories of women in their community.</p>“It’s not really our goal to cause our customers to cry,” Parodi said. “But to see them moved, and compelled, and made aware in a real heartfelt kind of way, that’s really the purpose of our café more than anything.”</p>

</div><p><strong><em>Editor’s Note: </em></strong><em>For four days of Super Bowl Week earlier this month, Shane Newell, a graduate student in Stanford’s Journalism Program, chauffeured Peter King, editor and lead columnist of Sports Illustrated’s spinoff football web site, the Monday Morning Quarterback (TheMMQB.com), as he served as pool reporter for the Denver Broncos practices at Stanford Stadium in advance of Super Bowl 50.  In exchange for driving King between his San Francisco hotel and Palo Alto and San José, Newell was granted access to him, observing King at work, and interviewing him about his 35 years as a sportswriter and about whether he might leave the MMQB when his contract expires in March.</em></p><a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-via="journoshane" data-size="large">Tweet</a><br />

He tells me that he is considering all options and that he might even leave SI, and that he wants to make his decision by next week, but at the moment he is on his iPhone in my passenger seat, this time interviewing Eagles Coach Doug Pederson.</p>Using a reporter’s notebook turned sideways, the blue-eyed, New England-born King, 58, takes notes with his Montblanc pen as my Mustang rolls down San Francisco’s crowded morning streets, less than a mile from his hotel. It has been a few hours since it rained, and as the puddles begin to dry, we head for the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.</p>Anticipating that former Packers quarterback Brett Favre will be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame later in the week, King wants to ask Pederson – a former reserve quarterback – about what it was like to play as a backup to Favre, best known today as the white-haired Mississippian endorsing razors and jeans on television.</p>“Weren’t you with [Favre] on the golf course the day he found out about his dad?” King asks Pederson, referring to the day Favre’s father passed away.</p>King is left handed, and holds the iPhone in his right hand as he takes notes with a black-and-silver pen. He’s got a watch on his left wrist and a teal Fitbit fitness tracker on his right. His hair is mostly gray, but there’s a prominent white tuft in the middle of his hairline – at roughly the 50-yard line.</p>Coaching the Eagles, King tells Pederson, is “one of the hardest jobs in the NFL.” Then he asks, “Why do you say ‘I can succeed here where others might have failed?’”</p>King is in San Francisco to cover his 32nd Super Bowl, a sort of homecoming since the first one he covered was Super Bowl XIX at Stanford Stadium in January 1985. That day Joe Montana’s 49ers defeated Dan Marino’s Dolphins 38-16, and King was a 27-year-old football writer with the Cincinnati Enquirer.</p>Since 1989, King has covered the NFL for Sports Illustrated, and, more recently, the MMQB, a website that delivers his 11,000-word weekly column to three million unique visitors per month, he says. His transformation from a print reporter to one of the Internet’s and television’s most authoritative voices on pro football took time, hard work and a 1997 decision that forever changed his career.</p>“He has developed important contacts who trust him with the truth,” said Ed Werder, an ESPN football reporter who worked alongside King at cnnsi.com in the late 1990s.</p>With his Pederson interview complete, we pull into a Starbucks parking lot in Pinole, about 20 miles northeast of San Francisco, and King gets behind the wheel so that I can interview him and take notes in the passenger seat. Sometimes he starts driving in second-gear, skipping first, saving a shift. We are bound for Napa where King will lunch with Carmen Policy, former president of the San Francisco 49ers, and the topic will be the Hall of Fame candidacy of Eddie DeBartolo Jr., the former 49ers owner who once was Policy&#8217;s boss. King is one of 46 members of the Hall of Fame Selection Committee.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have to determine whether I’m going to continue in my role that I’m in right now at The MMQB,” King tells me, “or whether I might go do something else.”</p></blockquote><p>I wonder: Why would King turn away from the football brand he has built as a journalistic heat-seeking missile once called “Relentless,” by former New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells, who admired King’s tenacity on the Giants beat?</p>“Part of what I think about is, ‘Should I do something else?’ ‘Should I try some other thing?’</p>“Maybe, ‘Should I try to do more television than I’ve done?’”</p>“There are times when I say, ‘This has become a monster and I really should sort of scale back,’” he says of the column. He pulls all-nighters every Sunday evening during the NFL season, finishing his MMQB column in the wee hours. King does most of his reporting on the phone from New York. He spends a month each summer visiting NFL training camps, and says he travels about twice a month during the regular season for reporting. He watches most NFL games on Sundays from NBC’s studio in Stamford, Conn.</p>The column consumes his thoughts. He says, “Part of me says it’s just way too much work.”</p>He is thinking out loud now.</p>“It is too much work, and it is a real weight on my shoulders every week, but when I finish writing (the column), I feel like this is sort of a good contribution to people’s intelligence about pro football.”</p>King mentions other reporting challenges he finds alluring.  He says he told his wife Ann that he might like to cover the 2020 presidential election.</p>“I don’t know if I could be any good at it,” he tells me as we approach Napa, “but I think it would be fun.”</p>King then talks about his dream of covering a full major league baseball season.</p>I wonder how many times King has written a story about a star free agent looking for his next big contract. Now, he is the star free agent. Covering baseball or politics, he wouldn’t have the personal history or access that he’s got in the NFL, America’s most popular professional game.</p>Later, shifting again, he says there is a chance he might move to NBC full-time, bringing his NFL column to NBC’s web site and doing more television work for the network.</p>Listening, I wonder if it’s the fatigue of a long season that has him talking about leaving SI for new challenges, or if it’s just Peter King being Peter King, and asking himself tough questions.</p>I reached Sports Illustrated Executive Editor Jon Wertheim. He declined to comment on King’s future.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As my Mustang rolls past Napa County vineyards and heads to San Francisco, King moves back to the front passenger seat.</p>He has served on the Hall of Fame selection committee for a quarter-century, and he tells me that he’s considering how much longer he should keep that job.</p>“I don’t think it should be a Supreme Court appointment,” King said on Dan Patrick’s radio show earlier in Super Bowl<strong> </strong>week. “I just don’t. I think that people have heard my arguments on certain players for years. So, time to listen to somebody else’s arguments. Maybe I’m wrong.”</p>I think, <em>King is telling me that he might give up his role at Sports Illustrated and as a Hall of Fame voter.</em></p>And it’s only our first day together.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Peter King speaks to Stanford lecturer Gary Pomerantz&#8217;s sports journalism class on Feb. 2 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.</p>
</div><p><strong>Mile 110:</strong></p><span class="sc-dropcap">I</span>t’s almost noon on Wednesday, and King is on his iPhone asking where he can enter Stanford Stadium, home to the Broncos’ practices for the next three days.</p>I ask King about one of his recent columns, “An Open Letter to Players,” in which he wrote about keeping the game “clean” and playing with “honor” in the wake of a vicious playoff game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers. In one malicious play during that game, Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict barreled into Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, who flopped backward to the turf with a concussion, ending his postseason.</p>“There’s nobody right now,” King tells me, “who can say with absolute certainty that football as we know it is going to exist in 2066.”</p>I ask if football’s concussion crisis is the reason he is thinking of covering baseball or politics.</p>“Whoever covers the game from now on,” he says, “has to do it with one eye on the safety of the game, the future of the game … and the number of people playing the game.”</p>His ringing phone interrupts King’s answer to my question. It’s Jared Goff, quarterback from Cal who has declared for the 2016 NFL Draft.</p>“Do you watch enough football to know and to say in your heart, ‘I think I’m the best quarterback in this draft?’” King asks Goff.</p>There is speculation that the Cleveland Browns, who have not won a championship in the Super Bowl era, will draft Goff with the second-overall pick.</p>King to Goff: “What are the aspects of your game that you think are the best right now?”</p>I ask King how many NFL contacts are stored on his iPhone. He says he isn’t sure. He hands me his iPhone and I finger-swipe a half dozen times and as the list scrolls downward the names go on and on. (Under the letter ‘T’’ I notice Tony Dungy and Tommy Lasorda, apparently listed by their first names.) Best I can tell, King has hundreds of contacts, an NFL writer’s gold mine.</p>“I doubt there is anybody in the league, including the commissioner, owners, general managers and head coaches, who Peter King could not get on the phone,” says Kevin Byrne of the Baltimore Ravens, a publicist in the NFL for the past 35 years. Byrne describes King as a “marvel” with “high-energy.”</p>Kurt Warner is on King’s iPhone list of contacts. A Super Bowl-winning quarterback with the Los Angeles Rams in 2000, and now a part-time football analyst, Warner says he occasionally uses the MMQB column as source material when he appears on television.</p>“If you come across an article and see he wrote it,” he says of King, “you take time to read it because you know it will be well done.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At times over the past few years King has been criticized for his NFL opinions and reporting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“I’ve made some mistakes and I’ve admitted them,” he says, “and I deserve to get beaten up.”</p>He cites the story of Ray Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens running back who was captured on video two years ago hitting his then-fiancée in an Atlantic City elevator. On Feb. 19, 2014, four days after that incident, TMZ released a brief<strong> </strong>video showing the startling image of Rice dragging his fiancée out of the elevator.</p>On July 29, five months after the first video was released, King reported that “the NFL and some Ravens officials” had seen security footage of the altercation between Rice and Palmer.</p>But later, on Sept. 8, King stepped back from his report in an open letter to MMQB readers after the league said it had not seen the footage.</p>“The source said league officials had to have seen it,” King wrote. “This source has been impeccable, and I believed the information. So I wrote that <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/07/29/jordan-gross-weight-retirement-panthers/2/">the league had seen the tape</a>. I should have called the NFL for a comment, a lapse in reporting on my part. The league says it has not seen the tape, and I cannot refute that with certainty.”</p>If the NFL had seen the tape before issuing a two-game suspension to Rice, it would have raised questions about the league’s judgment,<strong> </strong>and whether the penalty measured up to the severity of Rice’s actions.</p>Tommy Craggs, Deadspin editor at the time, was among King’s critics.</p>Deadspin, a sports website owned by Gawker, has frequently criticized King with headlines such as “Peter King is a Goddamn Embarrassment” and “Peter King Sounds New Depths of Stoogery With Open Letter to NFL Players.”</p>“The access has compromised whatever skepticism [King] might have had,” Craggs tells me. “The access made him a lot more sympathetic to the point of the view of the powerful people he’s talking to.”</p>Another criticism emerged in August 2015 when King owned up to a reporting mistake stemming from “Deflategate” — the controversy in which the New England Patriots were accused of using deflated footballs in a playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts.  After a reporter from The Boston Globe wrote about it, King used an unnamed league source that<strong> </strong>provided inaccurate information about inflation measurements.</p>“Clearly, this story, along with the Ray Rice story from last fall,” King wrote in his Aug. 24 column, “has made me question sources and sourcing in general.”</p>Greg Aiello, the NFL’s senior vice president of communications, brushes aside Craggs’ criticism. Aiello terms King “a real pro.”</p>“[King] will make a mistake here and there, but he’ll own up to it,” Aiello says. “He’s honest and fair.”</p>Aiello has known King for nearly 30 years, and the two exchange texts or emails about once a week.</p>“No one,” Aiello says, “is more respected, and no one works harder.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>It’s 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, less than 100 hours until kickoff in Santa Clara.</p>As the pool reporter covering Denver’s practice, King is responsible for interviewing head coach Gary Kubiak and submitting his notes and observations to the massive horde of football reporters. Only one pool reporter is allowed access to each team’s Super Bowl practices.</p>With his eyes glued to the MacBook screen in the passenger seat, King writes in stops and starts, the same movements of my Mustang as we navigate afternoon traffic. We drive along Sand Hill Road, a tree-lined stretch of road populated with venture capital firms catering to Silicon Valley’s elite.</p><em>Click. Click. Clack. Click.</em></p>The crunching keys are the sole source of sound until the seatbelt alarm screeches: King forgot to fasten it a few miles back.</p><em>Click.</em></p>It is mostly silent as King, a yellow media pass hanging from his neck, finishes writing his notes.  I notice the gold wedding ring on his left hand, representing more than three decades of marriage to Ann, just as King files his report.</p><strong>Mile 185:</strong></p><span class="sc-dropcap">K</span>ing stands in front of the hotel where the Panthers have just held a press conference near the San Jose Convention Center. Now he wears a size 8 blue-and-yellow Golden State Warriors cap and tells me that he wants to make a stop at In-N-Out Burger before heading to Stanford Stadium.</p>Though one of his daughters lives in San Francisco, it’s been more than four years since King savored the 1,065-calorie Double-Double burger and fries indigenous to the West Coast.</p>“Is it a double thing?” King asks the In-N-Out employee standing near the entrance of the drive-thru.</p>“The Double-Double No. 1?” she replies.</p>“Yes, please,” King says.</p>“Would you like onions?”</p>“Yes.”</p>He munches heartily and happily as the smell of two freshly-grilled hamburger patties fills my car.</p>A sportswriter’s life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>King slams the car door after the second Broncos’ practice.</p>“Peyton Manning was on fire,” he tells me. Manning was 24-for-28, completing three passes for more than 30 yards.</p>How does he know that? He wrote down every pass attempt.</p>But that’s about all that I can read in his notebook as most of the words are indecipherable.</p>It’s been nearly 20 years since King met with a Sports Illustrated editor to talk about a medium called the Internet. His editor, Steve Robinson, asked King if he could dump out his notebook every week for cnnsi.com, a joint-venture between CNN and Sports Illustrated.</p>In 1997, King’s main focus was to report on the NFL for Sports Illustrated, but as time passed, he devoted more time to his notes column. It started at 800 words per week, and has since ballooned to 11,000 words on some Mondays.</p>“I never thought that it would grow to this level and be this big,” he says.</p>It is the centerpiece of his brand.</p><strong>Mile 244:</strong></p><span class="sc-dropcap">O</span>ur journey nears its end after the final Broncos practice on Friday. Dressed in a long-sleeved red MMQB shirt and his Warriors cap, King prepares his final dispatch from Stanford Stadium.</p>“I’m a bit pressed for time,” he says, and he asks me if I know of a fast-food joint with a drive-thru on the way back to San Francisco. I suggest the In-N-Out in Daly City, and he loves the idea of savoring two Double-Doubles this week, and so we make the stop.</p>His career is one of transformation and reinvention. Born to a homemaker and iron worker in Springfield, Mass., King became a print journalist. Then he adapted to writing for the Internet and began appearing regularly on TV, he says, with virtually no training for the visual medium.</p>If he does remain with MMQB, King wants to see more videos and podcasts being produced on the site.</p>Don Banks, a Sports Illustrated colleague and long-time friend who spent King’s 50<sup>th</sup> birthday with him at a Red Sox game at Fenway Park, says, “He’s fearless about facing the new and figuring it out.”</p>At one point, King tells me, &#8220;I am not a great writer, not even close.&#8221; Then he emphasizes, &#8220;I&#8217;m not Rick Reilly or Tom Verducci or Gary Smith . . . I&#8217;m in Double-A, they&#8217;re in the major leagues.&#8221; There is seemingly a whole industry of sports journalists covering the NFL, dispensing information about the league. With his Sports Illustrated platform, and brand of inside reporting, King leapfrogged that crowd long ago.</p>We pull up to the curb in front of King’s hotel, returning from our four-day orbit. King hops out and closes the door, as cars mass in my rear-view mirror.</p>As I head back toward Stanford, passing the In-N-Out we had just visited, I think about how the MMQB column embodies the best of King’s indefatigable reportage and his playful spirit. There is hard-earned football insight and news, but also humor in the form of the “Beer-nerdness” and “Coffee-nerdness” sections that explore his love of drinks, and “Ten Things I Think I Think” and “The Adieu Haiku.”</p>Over the next few days, Brett Favre and Eddie DeBartolo Jr. would be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Broncos would defeat the Carolina Panthers 24-10 in Super Bowl 50, and King would get the post-game interview with Peyton Manning that he craved. Then, fueled by adrenaline and coffee, King would write his MMQB column while the rest of Santa Clara slept, posting it on Twitter at 3:37 a.m.</p>&nbsp;</p><a href="https://twitter.com/journoshane" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" data-size="large">Follow @journoshane</a><br />

While there are still a number of presidential hopefuls on the Republican side, the Democrats are down to a heated race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders</p>Sanders, a self-proclaimed &#8220;democratic socialist,&#8221; is an unusual candidate, leading a campaign that touts the problems of Wall Street, super PACs and corporate influence in Washington. His massive following is unexpected: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-young-democrats-love-bernie-sanders/">attracting largely young voters</a> compared to Clinton, who has more support from older voters.</p>The race is tight: in the Feb. 1 Iowa caucus, Clinton <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/primaries/iowa" target="_blank">barely edged</a> over Sanders &#8212; 49.9 percent versus 49.6 percent of the votes, respectively.</p>In late-January, ahead of the Iowa caucus and the primary season frenzy, Sanders had addressed his followers via video live stream. All around the country, supporters gathered at over 2,000 registered house parties to watch. We went behind-the-scenes at one such supporter gathering to hear from Sanders&#8217; fans, in the video above.</p>This house party took place at a housing cooperative in downtown Oakland called Fantasia, where a group of college graduates have transformed what was previously an architecture studio into their communal home. As strangers flooded in from the streets to support Sanders at the event &#8212; named &#8220;Bernie & Beers&#8221; &#8212; and partake in the communal lifestyle, the curious atmosphere and diversity of attendees shed some light on this grassroots campaign.</p>

Seth Johnson as he struggled to find alternate routes to southbound Highway 101, just north of Embarcadero, in San Mateo County. The crew discussed how to quickly transport the victim to nearby Stanford Hospital. Tragically, they never got the chance to execute the agreed-upon plan. Over the radio, the dispatcher pronounced: “patient is in full arrest &#8212; not breathing.”</p>Ronald Barbaran Garcia, 27, died after his motorcycle struck a vehicle at 5:47 p.m. on Sept. 22. A highway patrol officer was the first to arrive, and emergency responders reached the scene more than 10 minutes after the first 911 calls, missing their seven-minute goal by a wide margin.</p>&#8220;We failed to be where we needed to be within a period of time,” Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman told <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_28861023/palo-alto-motorcyclist-killed-collision-highway-101" target="_blank">the San Jose Mercury News on the day of the accident</a>. &#8220;Whether that would have made a difference in this incident, I&#8217;m not sure.”</p>The delay experienced by first responders that day wasn’t an exception. The response time for San Mateo County’s emergency personnel arriving at the scenes of accidents, heart attacks and other serious incidents has slowed in recent years, which Schapelhouman said is largely because of inescapable traffic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our job is often a race against time and right now, at certain times of the work day, [the delays] are ridiculous and I can’t accept that.</p></blockquote><p>“Our job is often a race against time and right now, at certain times of the work day, [the delays] are ridiculous and I can’t accept that,” Schapelhouman said in an interview earlier this month.</p>To call the community’s attention to the problem, the Menlo Park Fire Protection District has released a series of dramatic audio and video recordings showing how traffic congestion is snarling emergency vehicles. The District receives fire dispatches from Menlo Park, Atherton, East Palo Alto and unincorporated areas of San Mateo &#8212; an estimated population of 90,000.</p>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;"><p><iframe width="1050" height="591" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQfzZOLPbAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
</div><p>One of the videos is shot after an Aug. 27 multi-vehicle collision on the Dumbarton Bridge. A dashboard camera shows a fire truck traveling into incoming traffic for six minutes &#8212; almost the entire length of East Palo Alto along University Avenue &#8212; because of gridlock. The crew took 16 minutes to reach the emergency, where three victims awaited medical attention. You can hear the frustration in the voices of firefighters trying to get to the scene.</p>“When traffic is as bad as it was that day, we can’t physically get to the patient in a timely manner,” said Battalion Chief Dan Coyle of the occurrence. “Our duty is to show up, make a difference and save lives. When that’s impeded by traffic, it is pretty tragic.” The three victims were taken to the hospital for wounds, all in good condition.</p>On average, the district responds to 8,200 calls per year. “Many victims are alive today because of our timely response,” Coyle said. They are the reason firefighters adhere so strongly to the motto: “every second counts.” Yet response times have worsened over the last decade, with a significant tipping point in 2014, according to Coyle. “It happens almost every day now. We often have vehicle accidents on the freeway or on the Dumbarton Bridge and we literally can’t get there,” he said.</p>Despite the use of devices that automatically change traffic signals from red to green, there is no room for firefighters to advance. “We sometimes sit on a [traffic] light watching it turn green, yellow and red three or four times, and we can’t move 10 feet,” Coyle said. Traffic shoulders, when available, are too narrow in many stretches of the road for fire trucks to pass, and cars too often block their path.</p>As the Peninsula’s economy booms, the situation is expected to worsen. According to the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies, the Menlo Park District alone is projected to grow by nearly 20,000 residents over the next 25 years.</p>
<blockquote><p>People can’t afford to live here so they drive to get here. The result is that now it takes longer for people to get to hospitals.</p></blockquote><p>For Schapelhouman, the combination of inadequate public transportation and skyrocketing housing prices, which forces people to live further away from work, is the main reason for growing response times. “Until we fix mass transit, until we offer alternatives for people to get out of their cars, traffic will only get busier,” he said. “People can’t afford to live here so they drive to get here. The result is that now it takes longer for people to get to hospitals. They’re backed up at traffic, in ambulances, just as you are.”</p>Both Schapelhouman and Coyle mentioned Google’s mobile app Waze, which provides alternate routes to escape busy boulevards and packed freeways, as a “huge technological backlash.” With the app, more cars are now using shortcuts through residential neighborhood streets that are not designed to accommodate the volume and speed of cut-through traffic. Routes previously known only to first-responders and used to save critical seconds are now often clogged by new waves of traffic.</p>Beyond bumper-to-bumper traffic on those streets, the traffic directed by Waze is causing residents to request more calming devices, such as speed bumps, curb extensions and chicanes, which narrow the road so that traffic in one direction has to give way to opposing traffic. While they can help neighborhood traffic, these approaches often make things worse for first responders. “Some of our big trucks can’t get past these devices. People are trying to do things to make themselves feel safer, but by slowing the cars down, they also slow us down,” Coyle said. There are no official efforts to have Waze remove these routes from the app, “just the police department writing a lot of tickets” for careless drivers, Schapelhouman added.</p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Every minute counts</h3><p>The firefighters aim to respond to emergencies within seven minutes: one minute for receiving the 911 call; two minutes for the fire crew to get equipment ready and load the truck; and four minutes drive time in the most populated areas.</p>

</div><p>Such a rigid protocol is especially crucial in medical incidents, which amount to 71 percent of Menlo Park District’s calls. In a heart attack, a respiratory emergency or a trauma that causes severe blood loss, the brain can only live 8-10 minutes without oxygen. A small fire can grow to involve the entire room in the same timeframe. Keeping the response time goal is thus a vital concern for members of the community, who expect that when they make the call for help, it will come quickly.</p>Fire trucks rush to medical emergencies because of limited resources: in San Mateo County, there are 52 fire engines and 10 ambulances, according to Coyle. “Sometimes we wait for an ambulance to arrive for over 20 minutes,” he said. The firefighters are dual certified as either an emergency medical technician or paramedic, and they are able to stabilize patients while medical personnel is on the way.</p>The Menlo District is not certain of the number of calls that exceed the time goal, but the increasing number of delays has prompted the fire chief to adopt a monitoring system for all emergencies, closely keeping track of time performance. The results will be reported to the District’s board of directors.</p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Can roads designed for cars be safe for bikes?</h3><p>A proposal in Menlo Park to add bike lanes to part of El Camino Real raised concerns for firefighters, as the road is their primary route for emergencies. They believe that the addition of bike lanes will narrow the space for vehicles and further back up traffic.</p>
<div id="attachment_6814" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Chief1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-6814" src="http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Chief1-1024x574.jpg" alt="Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman is concerned with the rise of emergency response time because of inescapable traffic on the Peninsula.

</div><p>The city, they argue, is not taking into account the existing Willow Place Bicycle Bridge to Palo Alto and how that route connects with bike lanes on Willow Road, Middlefield, Laurel and Alma Streets. “Are these routes as convenient for bikers to ride on? No, but they’re a heck of a lot safer,” Schapelhouman said. “The last thing I want is to have our people go out and interact with someone who was hit by a vehicle, because typically the cyclist loses. The bigger the vehicle, the worse it is.”</p>Kristiann Choy, Menlo Park’s senior transportation engineer, believes firefighters wouldn’t be impacted by the change, as most bike lanes will be placed in spaces currently reserved for parking. On stretches without parking space, the city plans to narrow travel lanes. “Still, we wouldn’t go narrower than 10 feet, which fire trucks can maneuver in,” Choy assured. But Schapelhouman isn’t convinced: “All these narrower paths do one thing for response: slow us down,” he said.</p>Plans to address traffic congestion as a whole seem more inchoate. “We have planned a road transportation study to identify potential solutions for Willow Road that could provide some capacity relief,” Choy said. She doesn’t know when the study will be released, but believes it is “budgeted for this fiscal year.”</p>Meanwhile, firefighters fear for residents’ safety. “Bad things happen when we can’t get to where we need to go and lives hang in the balance,” Schapelhouman said. “Trust me, if we have a bad day, other people will have a worse day. It may not seem like a huge deal, but, in our world, seconds matter.”</p>

It means a lot to me,” said the 15-year-old, who has been practicing two hours a day in preparation for the February Olympic trials.</p>Since it was built more than a decade ago, the facility has broadened the attention the sport has received in the United States. It produced three of the four players who represented the United States in the 2012 London Olympics. Ariel Hsing, an Olympian from 2012, is from San Jose and now studies at Princeton University. Lily Zhang, also part of the U.S. Olympic team, is from Palo Alto. Timothy Wang, a Texas native, trained here.</p>Avvari and Kunal Chodri, a 16-year-old from Fremont, are said to be the top contenders among the men to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Among the women, it’s Zhang and Jiaqi Zheng, a 27-year-old student of Northwestern Polytechnic University in Fremont.</p>“The media never really covered table tennis before. But after [the] 2012 [Olympics], table tennis has gained a lot of popularity,” said Rajul Sheth, the executive director of the center. Sheth, who is originally from India, represented the state of Gujarat in table tennis tournaments and played in the Indian national circuit for nearly 14 years.</p>Sheth came to the United States in 2002 and was itching to do something with the game here. India Community Center, a nonprofit set up by Indian-American entrepreneurs Anil and Gautam Godhwani, offered to help. (ICC itself has two other centers &#8212; a main building two miles away from the table tennis facility, and another center in Cupertino. Both serve as hubs of cultural activities for the Indian community in the Bay Area.)</p>

</div><p>“We started in 2003 with two to three tables in the lobby of the India Community Center building, with around six kids. Now we have 200 kids who play here,” Sheth said.</p>The facility measures 20,000 square feet, with 30 tables and 12 full-time coaches on the floor. Paddles smash, shoes squeak and players grunt, as the shouts of coaches echo through the hall. Parents sit on the sidelines, observing their kids with pride and offering an occasional word of encouragement.</p>Bay Area demographics are conducive to the surge in local popularity of the game, as table tennis is popular among the Asian-American community. Census data from 2014 estimates the Asian population in Alameda County at 28.9 percent (of about 1.6 million) and in Santa Clara County at 34.9 percent (of about 1.9 million).</p>According to Sheth, 40 percent of the kids are Indian and 40 percent are Chinese. &#8220;A large majority of parents have played table tennis back in their home countries, so they want their children to take it up as well,&#8221; he said.</p>Chodri said he started playing because his father played in college back in India. Michael Sung, whose 11-year-old twin daughters, Joanna and Rachel, have been playing here for nearly four years, has a similar story. The Fremont-based engineer and his wife encouraged their girls to take up the sport because he and his wife played it in their home country, Taiwan. “Table tennis was how we met. We loved it; we thought our kids would like it, too,” he said. They do; they’ve gone to tournaments in Canada and China, and Sung dreams that, perhaps, they will represent the U.S. in the 2020 Olympics.<br />

<h3>Table tennis in Rio</h3><p>The young athletes are focused on national trials this month, with the Olympic trials soon after in February. According to Olympics rules, only one country from the North American region can make it to the final event. The battle is between Canada and the U.S., and the young athletes of India Community Center hope their country is represented.</p>Massimo Costantini, 57, a former Olympic player for Italy, and now a coach at the facility, believes the club stands a good chance in the women’s game, and perhaps even a spot in the men’s section. “The challenge is to ensure [players] peak at the right time. Winning in the nationals will be a good confidence boost,” said Costantini, who coached the Indian national team before coming to the Bay Area.</p>Costantini and all the players underscored the fact that table tennis is a mental game. “I prepare them in discipline and how to respect their bodies and to have a different attitude with their bodies,” he said.</p>With stakes so high, the stress can take a toll on these youngsters.</p>Avvari’s father, Murthy Avvari, an engineer with Sony, said they take their son to yoga and meditation sessions on weekends. “It helps him concentrate on his game and not worry about the results,” he said.</p>But what is it about the center that makes it a hub for talent? “It’s an environment with healthy competition. You can see your entire table tennis career at glance, under one roof. The little one wants to do better; the better ones want to be at the top; the ones at the top want to remain there,” Costantini explained, gesturing across the room to show all three levels &#8212; beginners, intermediate and advanced &#8212; playing at the same time. Sheth also credits the coaches for the center’s success.</p>As Avvari, Zheng and team walk out after an exhausting session, a batch of younger children walked in, equipment and parents in tow, and eyes filled with hopes of reaching table tennis greatness.</p>

</div><p>The seven species of abalone that live in the waters off the California coast are white, black, green, red, pink, pinto and flat abalone. Green abalone, along with pink and pinto, are part of NOAA’s Species of Concern Program, which “supports proactive conservation and research,” according to NOAA’s website.</p>Scientists believe white abalone have difficulty sustaining their numbers in the wild because the few that are left are too far from each other to successfully reproduce. So Aquilino&#8217;s team is breeding them in captivity, with the hope that the white abalone from the lab will be able to repopulate those in the wild.</p>Learn more in the audio podcast report above.<br />

Construction began in 2014, and the farm broke ground this September.</p>The farm provides experiential education through classes like &#8220;Principles and Practices of Sustainable Agriculture,&#8221; through a growing community of student, faculty and community volunteers and through research projects conducted on the property &#8212; like one to see which tomatoes grow best with the least amount of water. It is home to over 200 varieties of flowers, herbs, vegetables, field crops and fruit, and plans to harvest over 15,000 pounds of produce this year. Most of this will be served to students in dining halls, through a farm-to-campus program.</p>In the video above, we hear from Archie, facilities and production coordinators Rose Madden and William Chen, program coordinator Annie Shattuck, teaching assistant Maria Deloso, and bee rescue specialist Art Hall.

Train riders make the short walk home to a group of newly built condominiums and townhouses. Construction crews bolt glass panels onto a row of half-finished office buildings next to the train tracks. Parents play with their kids in a park nestled between four-story apartment complexes.</p>This is the Bay Meadows development, and it may represent the future of Silicon Valley. In response to skyrocketing rents and gridlocked freeways, a group of policy experts, developers and residents is pushing to transform downtowns and major thoroughfares along the Peninsula into transit-oriented projects like Bay Meadows.</p>It’s a modern take on how cities used to be designed: walkable communities of multi-story buildings, often with shops on the ground floor and apartments or office spaces above, clustered around Caltrain stations and other transit hubs. The goal is to add much-needed new housing in a way that encourages sustainable alternatives to driving.</p>In a region built around car-oriented suburban neighborhoods, the approach is a big — and often controversial — shift. Still, supporters say transit-centered development is the best way to accommodate the region’s population boom while keeping cars off congested roads and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p>“Denser development is the new thing,” said Bay Meadows developer Janice Thacher. “We think we can create a nice life for people in a 2,000-square foot condominium where they can be close to their work, be close to transportation, have all sorts of access to great opportunities to walk, to meet their neighbors, to use the parks, all of these things and that that is a better bet than putting another car on the freeway.”</p>
<h3>A new model for the Peninsula</h3><p>When the owners of the Bay Meadows horse racing track began to think about redeveloping the site in 2003, Thacher’s firm Wilson Meany saw a chance to apply its focus on urban mixed-use projects at a large scale. “Eighty-three acres of land to plan in a location like this with the Caltrain on site was a wonderful opportunity for us,” she said.</p>Working with financier Stockbridge Capital, Wilson Meany came up with a design that prioritized community and easy access to the train. They interwove apartments, office space and compact townhouses with parks, cafes, bike paths and a community garden. The site is still under construction, but the approach seems to be working. According to surveys conducted by Wilson Meany, over a quarter of the residents who have moved in take Caltrain on a weekly basis, and 85 percent walk or bike to nearby shops and restaurants.</p>Karen Luo is one of those residents. When she moved to Bay Meadows with her husband and young son two years ago, Luo developed a new morning routine. She makes the seven-minute walk from her home to the Caltrain station, catches the 7:28 a.m. train up to San Francisco, and then walks for 30 minutes to her office in the Financial District. “I don’t rely on a car at all, and I actually get some exercise out of my commute,” she said.</p>Luo’s new townhouse is smaller than her previous home in Foster City, but she said the community garden — where her son loves to play with master gardener Mike Irvine — and other social activities more than make up for the lost space. “We downsized a lot, but it’s just a much better experience.”</p>
<h3>Tackling job growth and jammed roads</h3><p><iframe style="border: none; float: right; width: 50% !important; min-height: 280px; margin: -12px 0 10px 30px;" src="http://web.stanford.edu/~barrera2/projects/tod/chart.html" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p>For policy experts, getting more people to follow Luo’s example is crucial to managing Silicon Valley’s growth. As the booming tech economy has drawn more people to the Peninsula, housing construction hasn’t kept pace.</p>Between 2010 and 2014, Santa Clara County added 189,000 new jobs, but only built 36,414 more housing units. And Census Bureau data show that what housing has been added often isn’t located in job centers like Palo Alto and the City of Santa Clara:</p><iframe style="border: none; margin: 0 -10px; width: calc(100% + 20px) !important;" src="http://web.stanford.edu/~barrera2/projects/tod/index.html" width="100%" height="650px"></iframe></p>This gulf between jobs and housing is driving up prices and forcing workers — especially lower income workers — to move further away from their jobs to find affordable places to live. In turn, that’s straining the region’s highways, which are carrying more cars for longer distances. Between 2010 and 2014, the number of daily vehicle miles traveled on freeways in the San Jose area increased 63 percent, from 16,922,000 to 27,553,000.</p>And barring an unforeseen downturn in the tech sector, Silicon Valley is likely to keep growing — the California Department of Finance projects Santa Clara County will have nearly 300,000 more residents by 2030. “That’s adding two more Sunnyvales to our existing population,” said Zoë Mullendore, a housing and transportation policy specialist with the business-backed Silicon Valley Leadership Group.</p>Building dense housing near transit is a key way to handle this growth and reduce congestion, said Ratna Amin with the urban policy think-tank SPUR. “There is no known solution to traffic besides other modes,” she said, referencing a strong body of research showing that adding more capacity to roadways doesn’t actually reduce congestion in the long-run, since the easier trip encourages people to drive more often.</p>Mullendore and Amin have been pushing governments on the Peninsula to embrace transit-oriented development, and they’re seeing success. In Sunnyvale, the Leadership Group worked with the city to develop a new transit-oriented development plan around Lawrence Caltrain Station. In San Jose, work is underway to turn the area around Diridon Station — which Mullendore called the future “Grand Central Station of the West” — into a high-density mix of housing and commercial space. In downtown Redwood City, the adoption of a new transit- and walkability-focused plan is already driving the construction of tall new apartments and office buildings.</p>“No question, cities are trying to adopt the right kinds of plans,” Amin said. But, she added, “it’s a real challenge when the rubber hits the road, when a real development project is proposed.”</p>
<h3>Not everyone’s on board</h3><p>On stage at new product launches, Silicon Valley celebrates density — more pixels on an iPhone screen, more transistors on a microchip. But when it comes to dense development, the region’s residents are often more hesitant.</p>While the Peninsula originally grew up around the stops of the Southern Pacific Railroad (now the Caltrain line), the rise of cars and highways after World War II shifted the region to today’s suburban pattern of office parks and single-family homes. Many residents like the small-town character of their communities and fear an influx of traffic from new development.</p>“I don’t think it’s incumbent upon those of us who have been longtime residents here in Redwood City to necessarily degrade the quality of our lifestyle in order to accommodate people who want to live or work here,” said homeowner David Gahagen, who organized a “Residents for Sensible Growth in Redwood City” group. The group formed in response to the building boom in downtown Redwood City, concerned that construction would lead to a mass of people driving through residential neighborhoods to get to downtown. It’s been pushing for a moratorium on new commercial buildings and backed sympathetic city council candidates in the Nov. 2015 election.</p>That kind of pushback is common. “I’ve seen opposition many times in the past,” said Mullendore, adding that while opposition is understandable, it makes it harder to solve the region’s housing and traffic problems. Complaints from neighbors can delay project approvals, downsize development and cause design changes like extra parking that discourage transit use, said SPUR’s Amin.</p>At Bay Meadows, for example, architects had to contend with a voter-imposed 55-foot height limit. “You can look out the window and see how that shaped the design,” Thacher said. Without the limit, she said they would have put taller office buildings next to the train station, and some of the housing would have been seven or eight stories instead of four.</p>Beyond affecting specific projects, opposition from residents creates political obstacles, said Russell Hancock, an advocate for regional planning who runs the Joint Venture Silicon Valley think-tank. Local officials in the Peninsula’s three-dozen cities are reluctant to approve development their constituents don’t want, and so the region as a whole isn’t meeting the demand for new housing. “There’s this reluctant acknowledgement that growth is happening and it needs to be accommodated, but [residents] don’t want it in their backyard, they want it in someone else’s backyard.”</p>
<h3>‘Density is not something to be scared of’</h3><p>Yet as the housing crisis worsens, some residents are starting to say they do want growth in their backyard. In the last year and a half, community groups in Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Redwood City have formed to advocate for new housing and transit options in their cities.</p>“A lot of people do feel like housing is an issue and we should be allowing different models, but the challenge is just that there haven’t been opportunities for these people to connect,” said Palo Alto resident Elaine Uang. An architect who was frustrated by what she saw as the community’s focus on stopping growth instead of effectively managing it, Uang helped found Palo Alto Forward in September 2014. “We started out as forty,” she said, “and we just kept growing and growing and finding support and interest from lots of different corners.”</p>In Menlo Park, “it started with a beer in a backyard,” said Imagine Menlo steering committee member Andrew Barnes. After voters in the city rejected <a href="http://peninsulapress.com/2014/11/05/menlo-park-measure-m-defeated/">Measure M</a> — a 2014 ballot measure that would have restricted new development — a group of residents like Barnes were looking for a more “aspirational” way to move forward. “Density is not something to be scared of,” he said. When done right, “density and vibrancy adds to the overall character of the community and makes it an even more desirable place to live.”</p>So far, both groups have focused more on policy changes than specific development projects. Palo Alto Forward is pushing to reduce parking requirements that make housing more expensive (each space can cost $30,000 or more) and allow mixed-use buildings with housing and retail space near the city’s Caltrain stations. Imagine Menlo is supporting Menlo Park’s plan to add new development near the downtown train station and along El Camino Real.</p>But Uang said that if they can implement policies that encourage denser development, Palo Alto Forward will be ready to rally community backing. “When a good project comes up, a really important housing development on Cal. Ave. that is going to enable a range of incomes to live there, and it’s going to enable a number of people to go car-light &#8230; heck yeah, we want to support that.”</p>

The 77-year-old is a retired major-general from the Indian Army, and visits the India Community Center, a nonprofit organization. He never misses a single day.</p>India Community Center is aimed at bringing together the large Indian populace in the Bay Area, and it offers activities for everyone right from the age of five to the elderly. It was set up in 2003 with the help of Indian-American entrepreneur brothers, Anil and Gautam Godhwani.</p>Chopra, along with hundreds of other senior citizens, participate in the senior citizens program at the facility.</p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been associated with the India Community Center for 17-18 years. This place offers avenues for people of our age; we can meet new people, talk, participate in events, and keep our physical and mental faculties intact,&#8221; said Chopra, whose wife is also a member. </p>The program offers a variety of activities, including yoga, Bollywood dance classes, karaoke sessions, bridge games and discussions. Additionally, seniors can work out in the gym, play a game of pool, read newspapers or books, and even get free legal and medical counseling sessions.</p>&#8220;When people step inside this building, they feel like they are in India now,&#8221; said Pragati Grover, executive director of India Community Center, which also has a center in Cupertino. For seniors, especially, this is extremely important. &#8220;After the kids have gone to work and grandchildren have gone to school, there is nobody to talk to [for these senior citizens]. Here in ICC, they get to meet people. They can be free here. And after the program, they talk to each other, become friends and start going out as well,&#8221; said Vimala Balan, who is a coordinator at the Cupertino center.</p>For Harshad Saparia, this space means a lot more. Saparia had a stroke more than two years ago. Along with medicines and therapy sessions, it was the support of the seniors that helped him bounce back. &#8220;I had forgotten to even count to ten. I had to learn everything from scratch. Thanks to the encouragement from the seniors here, and the exercises and yoga, I now drive here by myself,&#8221; he said, smiling with pride.</p>For the seniors who frequent the facility, the members are just like family. They talk, play, sing, dance and eat together. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we would do without the India Community Center,&#8221; Chopra said.</p>

The suited men and veiled women in the pews &#8212; nearly all of them Assyrian &#8212; join in the ancient chants as they pray for peace and resolution to a crisis both historic and modern: the persecution of their brothers and sisters in the Middle East. </p>Indigenous to northern Iraq, Assyrians have lived in the region for more than 6,000 years. They converted as a people to Christianity in the first century A.D. and are one of the oldest continuous Christian communities in the world. But in the past century, violence and religious persecution have escalated, forcing most of them to seek safety in other countries. Some 10,000 now reside in the Bay Area. With the rise of the Islamic State, they now risk vanishing from their homeland altogether.</p>The problem is that “the Christians have nowhere to go,” said Father Lawrance, whose family fled Kirkuk, Iraq, when he was 14 as former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein rose to power.</p>

</div><p>Most of the parishioners at Mar Yosip are from Iraq or Iran, although a few are from Syria and other countries in the Middle East. Many in the community still have family in the Middle East: some who have remained by choice, others who are caught in the limbo of refugee camps as they await a chance at a new life.</p>Since the rise of the Islamic State, Assyrians in the Bay Area have tried multiple avenues to help their relatives in the region. Some have petitioned the State Department to more forcefully defend Christians in the Middle East. Others are urging the United States Agency for International Development to directly fund Assyrian humanitarian aid groups. And others are working to get families approved for asylum in the United States.</p>But many in the community feel disappointed so far in the U.S. response. And there is a deep worry that this ancient group could disappear completely.</p>“We kind of feel like our life is paralyzed,” said Rochelle Yousefian, president of the Assyrian American Association of San Jose. “The government that we are so proud of living in in the country of peace is not taking any actions, it’s not even open to listen to these atrocities. It makes us feel hopeless; it makes us unproductive because we don’t know what to do, we don’t know how to help.”</p>The history of Assyrian Christians in the Middle East has been punctuated by periods of violent persecution. In 1915, the year Assyrians call the Seyfo &#8212; “the year of the sword” &#8212; the Ottoman Empire slaughtered as many as 300,000 Assyrians. In 2003, it was estimated that 30,000 Assyrian Christians still lived in the city of Mosul in northern Iraq. But after the Islamic State captured the city in the summer of 2014, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/last-remaining-christians-flee-iraq-mosul-201472118235739663.html" target="_blank">none remain</a> &#8212; having been either killed or forced to flee.</p>“This is a genocide,” said Albert Nissan, a Mar Yosip parishioner who emigrated from Baghdad in 1975 and has family members still living there.</p>“The people who emptied Mosul of its Christians are the same people who bombed Paris,” he added, referring to the November attacks by Islamic extremists that killed 130 people and injured hundreds more.</p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>No safety in Syria</h3>

</div><p>When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, many Assyrians sought refuge in Syria, which was comparably peaceful at the time. But they were held in UN refugee camps “for years,” said Father Lawrance, and when civil war broke out in Syria five years ago, some were trapped again by the violence they had hoped to escape.</p>Conditions for Assyrians in Syrian refugee camps are “horrible,” said Poline Maiel, a parishioner of Mar Yosip. Girls risk being kidnapped and Christians are frequently targets of violence, she said. “Whatever we think about [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad, before the war the Assyrians [in Syria] had a good life and they were safe. Now, they are targeted by everybody.”</p>In February, the Islamic State captured around 230 Assyrian Christians in Syria and <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/syria-isis-beheads-3-assyrian-christians-demands-14-million-ransom-releasing-280-hostages-new-649682" target="_blank">held them for a ransom</a> of around $14 million. That month, Assyrian Bishops in the United States called on Secretary of State John Kerry to take “concrete steps to help the remaining Assyrian Christians in the region to protect themselves.” The Islamic State <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/islamic-state-ten-assyrian-christian-hostages-released-syria-150-remain-captured-150912/" target="_blank">released</a> some of the sick and elderly prisoners, but continues to hold around 150 Assyrian Christian hostages.</p>In October, three of the hostages were executed. One of the victims was the first cousin of a parishioner at Mar Yosip, and other family members are still being held for ransom by the Islamic State.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Asylum at last</h3><p>In June 2014, Shamiran left her village outside of Mosul with her three teenage children on temporary visitor visas to attend a family wedding and visit her parents in the Bay Area, who are parishioners at Mar Yosip. But when ISIS overtook Mosul that summer, her husband who had remained in Iraq told her not to return because of the security risk.</p>Unable to return to Iraq, &#8220;Shamiran&#8221; &#8212; who didn’t want her real name used because of security concerns &#8212; and her children applied for asylum in the United States. In June, nearly a year after their arrival, they were granted asylum.</p>In broken English, Shamiran described the experience of Christians in Mosul who were forced to flee the city and have their houses marked as being inhabited by Christians. “There were many Christian families in Mosul,” she said. “They left everything in Mosul and they went. [ISIS] put Arabic letter “Nun” [on our houses]. It means Christian &#8212; “Nazarene.”</p>Shamiran’s husband’s request for asylum has also been approved, but he’s still waiting for the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to certify his identity and complete a background check.</p>Having been in the United States for a year-and-a-half now, Shamiran has found a job working at a grocery store, and her three children are earning A&#8217;s in Bay Area high schools. But she yearns for the day when she can be reunited with her husband. “My husband is safe now, thank God. I need for him to come here to live in peace with us to be a family again.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Waiting for visas</h3><p>For the few Assyrian Christians left in the Middle East, the threat of attacks by the Islamic State makes each day more perilous. But migrating to the West has become increasingly difficult, as waves of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa pour into Europe. In the United States, fears of terrorism have prompted debates about how many &#8212; if any &#8212; refugees the United States should admit.</p>Father Lawrance agrees that refugees to the United States should be screened carefully to prevent terrorists from being admitted to the country. “But they have to differentiate between who’s doing the killing and who’s being persecuted,” he said.</p><a href="http://peninsulapress.com/2015/10/30/eshoo-says-no-quick-fix-housing-crisis-traffic-gridlock-silicon-valley/">Rep. Anna Eshoo</a>, the only Assyrian member of Congress, serves California’s 18th district covering parts of San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties. Eshoo, a Democrat whose parents are Assyrian Christians who fled persecution in the Middle East, voted in November against a House Republican bill to pause the admittance of Syrian refugees into the United States. Despite its passage by a wide majority that included many Democratic votes, Eshoo voted against the measure because it amounted to a “bureaucratic blockade for all refugee applicants.”</p>In June, Eshoo, who is the co-chair of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus, called on President Barack Obama to do more to help Middle Eastern religious minorities like Assyrians by prioritizing additional security support for vulnerable populations, especially the ancient Christian community. Eshoo has also called on the president to designate an additional 5,000 priority refugee visas for religious minorities from the Middle East.</p>But the process, said Eshoo in a recent interview, is “very, very slow,” since the United States has a complex system of rules for granting refugee visas. Eshoo says her goal is to expedite visas for Middle East Christians, since she fears that relief might not arrive before they are “dead and gone.”</p>

The image is so vivid that you almost forget you are actually sitting in an office in San Francisco, wearing a virtual reality (VR) headset.</p>MoodMe, a new VR application, gives users similar experiences with the aim to change moods in a positive way, specifically through yoga and meditation. Co-founders Oksana Zavoyko, a psychologist and author of &#8220;Dreambook,&#8221; and Nisa Ahmadova, a software engineer, developed MoodMe, an app in which a user can step onto the beach in Bali, to see, hear and &#8220;join&#8221; the practice of a yoga expert.</p>Through virtual reality, the brain can succumb to compelling evidence that you are actually somewhere else. The MoodMe team believes that not only putting users in a relaxing location, but also completing the exercises, can shift your mood and teach you to live a more mindful life &#8212; overcoming the stresses encountered in everyday life.</p>Others believe that mediation’s goal in being mindful is best applied to daily life: practicing yoga or meditation on a beach in Bali removes one’s self from reality and avoids life’s stress-triggering events.</p>The MoodMe team aims for their app to become a place to find calm, focus and energy. A use case is if you are at work and just came out of a stressful meeting, you can put the headset on and be transported to a different place, in order to instantly change your mood.</p>Additionally, in virtual reality, you can enter the space with yoga or meditation masters from around the world. For those who practice regularly, they can learn from a wide range of teachers who come from different backgrounds. For yoga novices, mind and body experiences are shared with the teacher, something only possible when physically present with the teacher, or with MoodMe through immersion in virtual reality.</p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Importance of mindfulness</h3><p>Mindfulness, writes Karen Kissel Wegela Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-courage-be-present/201001/how-practice-mindfulness-meditation" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a>, teaches us how to be unconditionally present, no matter what is happening. “When we are mindful, we show up for our lives.”</p>For example: have you ever felt, when you are running late, that you must get there on time, no matter the consequences? You’ll swerve between traffic, almost hit a pedestrian, lash out at the driver who took too long at the stop sign, a danger to yourself and others.</p>“You’re basically a lizard, you’re basically a reptile because you’re in your reptilian brain, or you’re an early mammal that doesn’t have the capacity for higher order functioning,” says Donnovan Somera Yisrael, health educator for iThrive Vaden Health Promotion Services at Stanford University.</p>Our brain and emotions have developed further since this reptilian or early mammal phase, but under stress conditions, like you feel when you are running late, you can revert back to this primitive state. “You cannot manage your emotions and body and central nervous system when you don’t know what it needs,” Yisrael said. That’s when mindfulness can come into play.</p>Yisrael told Peninsula Press that the central nervous system is the body&#8217;s operating system. It needs a feedback loop &#8212; like a fire alarm needs to know there is smoke to turn on the sprinklers. Since you need to know what your system needs to calm down, to focus and to be present, mindfulness can help you become aware of yourself and your body.</p>“Ideally, mindfulness can be practiced in our real lives,” said Yisrael, but it can also be practiced in a controlled setting through meditation. Being fully present in the body, according to Zavoyko, makes the environment in which we choose to meditate, crucial. The MoodMe app lets users choose a space &#8212; a feature that might help users feel more comfortable in an ideal environment.</p>Zavoyko is currently in India, filming yoga classes and scenery in 360-degree video.</p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VR&#8217;s role in meditation, mindfulness</h3><p>With the MoodMe app, the team combines “modern virtual reality and ancient yoga technique” to bring a sense of presence to the user. With the immersive nature of virtual reality, the body can feel present in Bali, Thailand or India.</p>But while VR can help people be mindful by virtual means, some argue that if you need your virtual reality headset to be mindful, you are relying too much on the technology. MoodMe’s Zavoyko and Ahmadova hope their users will be able to take what they practice inside of virtual reality back to the real world, where mindfulness can be applied.<br />
