<p>You get <a href="http://papadosio.com/">Papadosio</a>: a sensory overload, making listeners feel as though they are a part of each song, epitomized in their latest release, Extras in a Movie. Each song is intended to replicate the relationship between such individuals, perhaps much like those at a concert, in which they are strangers gathered together in the same place, at the same time, and for the same reason. Not necessarily familiar with each other, but each perfectly placed next to the other, clearly intended to be standing so close.</p>

<p>Athens, Ohio born, Dosio is now based out of Asheville, North Carolina, albeit they spend much more time on the road than at home, playing an average of 150 shows a year. The five member powerhouse boasts four albums, many shows, festival after festival, and a following that rivals much older groups. Their follower travel show to show much like that of older groups, taking the love of Papadosio farther than just one’s hometown. Converting fans at every show, tantalizing viewers with their light show, this is one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1516291875349763/">show</a> you do not want to miss out on.</p>

Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville’s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly &amp; the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material. Songs like “Dancin’ To The Truth” off their latest record, Dirty Word (July 30, 2013, Louisiana Red Hot Records), offer an escape into the funky sublime, sharing the true spirit of New Orleans with every note.</span></p>

<p>Each individual member of Audiodacity has been involved with music for the majority of their lives; however, they were all c<span class="text_exposed_show">lose friends long before forming a band was ever even an idea—some members have even known each other as early as elementary school. It is this camaraderie, this sense of brotherhood, that allows them pull 6 completely different musical backgrounds and influences into one cohesive, powerful sound. From their humble beginnings as a cover band in the fall of 2010, Audiodacity performed across Indianapolis and various cities for a full year before writing their own original music. </span></p>

<p><span class="text_exposed_show">In January 2012, Audiodacity transformed from a quintet into a sextet when long-time friend, Will Skirvin joined their ranks—they finally had the complete sound they were looking for, and they never looked back. Since coming into the music scene, Audiodacity has been given a lot of love from the city of Indianapolis. Named &#8220;Indy&#8217;s Next Big Thing 2012&#8221; by local radio stations Q95 and X103, they have earned the opportunity to open for nationally touring acts and perform in Indy&#8217;s largest venues. In 2013 they began playing out of state shows, bringing the party to Illinois, Michigan, and Arkansas where they were met with many positive reviews. They ended the year by winning Indiana&#8217;s largest battle of the bands competition, The Battle for Birdys. Audiodacity has ended their “winter hibernation” and are currently in production of their debut album. Audiodacity’s ongoing mission is to use music as an outlet to share their love of life and to spread their message that “Anything is possible!”</span></p>

<p>Using entire shows from the Grateful Dead’s decades of touring as a launching pad, Dark Star Orchestra recreates song for song performances straight from historic set lists. Not merely mimicking the Dead, DSO instead seeks the individual style of each era and offers its own interpretations and improvisations for a group famed and loved for their interpretations and improvisations.  Having toured worldwide to the tune of over 2000 shows, Dark Star Orchestra’s determined commitment to ‘raising the Dead’ has drawn them much critical acclaim.</p>
<p>Critics aren’t the only ones singing Dark Star Orchestra’s praises. Five original members of the Grateful Dead have played alongside DSO and have had this to say: “Playing with Dark Star Orchestra is something that feels just exactly like it felt when I was playing with the Grateful Dead.” – Donna Jean Godchaux, Grateful Dead vocalist, frequent DSO guest</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10991411_10153095567787300_5070744778572345068_n.jpg?oh=c44a36b9780b325ecd6b88e0dbe30814&amp;oe=5763D5B8" alt="" /></p>
<p>Made up of Jeff Mattson (lead guitar/vocals), Lisa Mackey (vocals), Dino English (drums), Rob Koritz (drums), Skip Vangelas (bass), Rob Eaton (rhythm guitar/vocals) and Rob Barraco (keyboards), Dark Star Orchestra does not try to match Grateful Dead live songs note for note. Anything more formulaic would quickly dispel the free spirit embodied in the music.</p>
<p>Precision is king with DSO, which position the stage plot based on the year of Grateful Dead show to be performed, adapting phrasing, voice arrangements, and even arranges specific musical equipment for the various eras of Dead music performed. At the end of every performance, the band announces the date and venue where the original show just covered took place. Dark Star Orchestra dips into every incarnation of the Dead, so most fans can “see” shows that happened long before they were born.</p>
<p>Dark Star Orchestra isn’t a cover band. Its shows are not even meant as tributes. What Dark Star Orchestra achieves is a continuation of the spirit of what has now become over forty years of the Grateful Dead’s timeless music.</p>

<p>Widespread Panic has been together going on 30 years. Formed by original members vocalist/guitarist John &#8220;JB&#8221; Bell, bassist Dave Schools and late guitarist Michael Houser, who lived together in a suburban house in Athens, GA, where they met as students not far from the University of Georgia campus, later to be joined by drummer Todd Nance. Shortly after that, the band&#8217;s line-up was solidified with the addition of percussionist Domingo &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Ortiz and keyboard player John &#8220;JoJo&#8221; Hermann.</p>
<p>Formed in the tradition of the great southern guitar blues bands, with an improvisatory ethos, Widespread Panic continue to explore a sound all its own on the band&#8217;s 12th album, Street Dogs, their first studio effort since 2010&#8217;s Dirty Side Down. When asked to describe Street Dogs, Widespread Panic&#8217;s debut album on Vanguard Records, JB references the way Dr. John describes the music scene in New Orleans as &#8220;a gumbo of musical influences.” JB cites Van Morrison and George Carlin as influences while Dave (Grateful Dead/Miles Davis), Mike (Emerson Lake and Palmer), Todd (Steely Dan), Sunny (Tito Puente), JoJo (classically trained with a love for Professor Longhair) and Jimmy (Beatles/ Mahavishnu Orchestra) all bring something different to the table. &#8220;Above all, after nearly thirty years together, we are arguably each other&#8217;s greatest influence,” JB concludes.</p>
<p><iframe width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYU-N-sLeaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>That eclectic approach includes the funky New Orleans flavor of &#8220;Sell Sell,” their cover of The Animals keyboardist Alan Price&#8217;s song from the soundtrack of the 1973 Malcolm McDowell film O Lucky Man!, and the playful nod to a missing feline in the gentle progrock of &#8220;Steven&#8217;s Cat,” written and recorded in a single day in the studio. Guitarist Jimmy Herring – who joined the band eight years and three albums ago &#8212; makes his presence felt with the jazzy feel set against a psychedelic mellotron and the ethereal choir in &#8220;Angels Don&#8217;t Sing the Blues.” Sunny Ortiz&#8217; and Duane Truck&#8217;s percussive interplay on the track creates a driving foundation that seamlessly shifts to a shuffle feel, then six/four time, allowing the song to land gently back to Earth. Herring also coaxes a bluesy harp sound in the honky-tonk barrelhouse of Hermann&#8217;s &#8220;Poorhouse of Positive Thinking,” the keyboardist&#8217;s tongue-in-cheek paean to the pleasures and pitfalls of alcohol. &#8220;Jamais Vu (The World Has Changed),” a song dedicated to the memory of a crew member&#8217;s passing, finds JB exuding a soulful growl, while the band pays its debts to the delta blues with a rollicking cover of Canadian singer-songwriter Murray McLauchlan&#8217;s &#8220;Honky Red,” a song Dave&#8217;s father once recorded and shared with the band and an outsized take on Howlin&#8217; Wolf&#8217;s &#8220;Tail Dragger.”</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to keep the songs as live as possible, with a minimum of overdubs,” explained JB about the sessions with longtime producer John Keane at Asheville, NC&#8217;s Echo Mountain Studios. &#8220;That gave us some of that grit and spontaneity. We recorded as a band, playing together, rather than individual parts. They might not all be first takes, but most were done in a single take. We approached it in an anti-factory way, looking to create our own fun, to have our own unique experience. It&#8217;s not homogenized.”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thebarnpresents.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_2393.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>That can be heard on the closing &#8220;Street Dogs for Breakfast,” a shaggy-dog countryblues that has a laid back sing-along, quality while &#8220;Cease Fire,” with its tribal percussion and bluesy guitars, addresses not only external warfare but the conflicts within, as the closing majestic Herring guitar solo embodies the smooth transition from words to a calming spirit of reconciliation.</p>
<p>JB says the band, true road warriors, continue to explore those happy accidents in the studio. &#8220;We wanted to capture that on-stage spontaneity,” says JB, the band having released a pair of live acoustic albums since their last studio release. &#8220;We tried to find that place where everybody is familiar with the material, but loose enough to have that element of discovery. The entire band was together in the studio every day, which was a first for us. The songs are created among us, individually and collectively, based on what&#8217;s going through our subconscious at the time. Every song is a different experience. We try to sequence those tracks in a way that lets the album flow.”</p>

<p>With next year marking three decades since forming their original line-up in 1986, Widespread Panic is still hungry to be the best band they can be, every single night, for their loyal fan base. Their accomplishments over that time are well-documented. During their impressive, now 30-year run, the band has released 12 studio albums (including Street Dogs) and 43 live albums, selling more than 3 million copies as one of the most successful touring acts in the world. Widespread Panic has broken attendance records at major venues throughout the country, including a staggering 48 sold-out shows at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado. A banner hangs in the rafters at Philips Arena in Atlanta where the band has 18 sellouts, with records also set at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans, Oak Mountain Amphitheater near Birmingham, AL and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival where Panic has headlined eight times, breaking the single day attendance record with 63,000. The band has headlined most of the major U.S. festivals, including Bonnaroo (eight times), Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, Lockn&#8217; Music Festival, Outside Lands Music Festival, Forecastle Festival, Phases of the Moon, Rothbury Festival, All Good Music Festival, Gathering of the Vibes and many more. To commemorate Widespread Panic&#8217;s 25th anniversary in 2011, the State of Georgia&#8217;s Senate and House of Representatives passed resolutions honoring the group for their music, service, charity and longevity, while they were also inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>&#8220;We acknowledge this is a milestone few groups get to achieve,” admits JB about their remarkable longevity. &#8220;It&#8217;s like Hemingway&#8217;s Old Man and the Sea. Every time we go out there, we learn more tricks, bring that knowledge with us, and then apply it. We&#8217;re way more experienced, focused and to the point, but still willing to stretch out without wandering too much.”</p>
<p><img src="http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/04/27/21/ee/WidespreadPanic.0426A.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>Street Dogs represents just that… a blend of veteran musicianship and the ability to keep things sounding fresh at the same time. &#8220;Doing this right, you&#8217;re more a reporter, a conduit, than a creator,” says JB. &#8220;We&#8217;re really just discovering something that&#8217;s already there. Our creative bank is still open, and they&#8217;re handing out free money.” JB says the band is energized by having been in the studio, and are &#8220;&#8230;excited to play these new songs live and see where they take us… and the audience.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Crack yourself open and stuff will keep coming out of you,” he says, concluding with one of his patented JB-isms, even if this one is from his grandfather, another JB. &#8220;He told me, ‘Remember to keep an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out.&#8217;” That&#8217;s as good a description of the way to approach Widespread Panic&#8217;s latest album as any.</p>

<p>Black Tiger Sex Machine are a trio of electronic music producers from Montreal, Canada. Known for their heavy electro and bass sound, they perform a unique show in which they combine tracks, loops, drums, samples and synths into an intense barrage of sounds and beats, all while wearing their iconic Tiger Helmets. They first caught industry attention in 2012 with a series of blistering electro releases accompanied by live demos and video clips showcasing their innovative and energetic performances.</p>

<p>After several overseas tours to Europe and South Africa in 2013 and 2014, they made their highly-anticipated US debut in January 2015. Constant touring throughout the year across North America saw them raise their profile considerably as they made high-profile appearances at festivals like Electric Forest, TomorrowWorld, Electric Zoo, Lollapalooza and Escape from Wonderland. Their dedication and groundwork has attracted an ever-growing fanbase dubbed the BTSM Church. Black Tiger Sex Machine are also the brains behind Kannibalen Records, which has quickly become one of the top independent labels in the game. Through Kannibalen, they’ve shaped the careers of breakthrough artists like Snails, Apashe, Kai Wachi &amp; Dabin.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/12647264_10153856311584197_475915804800723432_n.jpg?oh=927292642d4e42edd732fb156cefef1c&amp;oe=573103DD" alt="" /></p>
<p>In 2016, BTSM are primed to further consolidate their status as the standardbearers of the new electro sound. They’ll kick off the year with their debut fulllength album before going on a 3-month tour across North America accompanied by fellow Kannibalen Records artists Apashe and Dabin. With the BTSM Church attracting new faithful every day, the group shows no signs of slowing down as they strive to push musical boundaries in dance music.</p>

New York, NY<br />
Planet Human // SubHuman</p>
<p>Dieselboy was the first drum and bass artist to chart a single on Billboard’s dance chart with “Invid” in 2000, and was the first American voted into the UK-based Drum &amp; Bass Arena Top 10 DJs online poll in 2004. He&#8217;s been featured on magazine covers, interviewed for documentaries, TV and radio, heard on MTV, ESPN and action/adventure video games, and sponsored by DC Shoes and Pioneer Pro DJ.</p>
<p>In 2002 Dieselboy founded Human Imprint, North America’s most prolific, dynamic and innovative drum and bass label, and is co-founder of SubHuman (dubstep, electro, trap), under the umbrella of Planet Human. Planet Human is beloved by its fans for the quality of its next level high energy releases by international vanguard artists including Bare (US), Mark Instinct (Canada), Mayhem (US), Muffler (Finland), Nerd Rage (US), Nightwalker (UK), NumberNin6 (US), Pixel Fist (UK), Subshock (Spain), Zardonic (Venezuela), and Faces of Def (Dieselboy&#8217;s collaboration with Mark the Beast).</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/10409101_1003943832953285_3321407589388314470_n.jpg?oh=cbcf238eefdf19431f034df3f210697c&amp;oe=57281334" alt="" /></p>
<p>Dieselboy’s legacy is also one of non-stop trailblazing dancefloor destruction on the international club circuit as well as at major global music festivals including Bassrush, Bonnaroo, Coachella, Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival (Las Vegas, Mexico, New York, Puerto Rico), SXSW, Summerfest, Ultra Music Festival, US Virgin Mobile FreeFest, Weird Bass Music Festival, Motion Notion (Canada), Shambhala (Canada), Borsodi Hegyalja Fesztival (Hungary), World Bass Summit (Japan), Jisan Valley Rock Festival (Korea), PRSPCT XL (Netherlands), Creamfields (Poland), Pirate Station (Russia), Global Gathering (UK), and PHAT 09 (New Zealand). He also toured with Moby’s Area2 and played heavy metal concerts with Orgy and Disturbed.</p>
<p>Dieselboy’s DJ career began in northwest Pennsylvania DJing high school dances. While a student at the University of Pittsburgh he learned to beat-match vinyl live on college radio and played trance, happy hardcore and breaks at house parties. His 1994 mixtape “The Future Sound of Hardcore” led to out of town bookings and his expanding popularity and technical skills led to the honor of being the first American asked by a British drum and bass label to mix a compilation (“Drum &amp; Bass Selection USA,” 1996).</p>
<p><iframe width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkM91or_xSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In 1997 Dieselboy moved to Philadelphia to be drum and bass buyer and T-shirt designer for seminal rave culture/record store 611. In 1998 Dieselboy was the first American drum and bass DJ to be nominated for Best Drum &amp; Bass DJ at the Global DJ Mix Awards and tied with LTJ Bukem. From 1998 to 2004 Dieselboy hosted North America’s premier drum and bass weekly “Platinum” at club Fluid. In 2000, Dieselboy co-founded with fellow Stateside drum and bass warriors AK1200 and DJ Dara the Planet of the Drums super crew (with MC Messinian) &#8211; electronic dance music&#8217;s longest running annual tour, now in its 16th year (2015).</p>
<p>Dieselboy continuously raises the bar for the DJ mix as an art form, and each of his from 1992 to his latest tour de force “Dieselboy &#8211; The Destroyer” stands the test of time. State of the art showcases of producers and graphic artists of each respective musical era, Dieselboy’s mixes have been described as “cinematic” and “intoxicating.” Dieselboy’s goal in creating each mix is “to make the most intricate, layered, nuanced, amazing drum and bass mix ever done. Period.” His sixth sense for sublime exquisite blends &#8211; &#8220;the sound of heaven crashing into hell,&#8221; as he once described it &#8211; is as transcendent as it is legendary.</p>
<p>In his dramatic intros (a Dieselboy trademark) his narrators [who include movie trailer voice legend Don LaFontaine, Peter Cullen (“The Transformers”&#8217; Optimus Prime), Lynanne Zager (“Lost,” “Fantastic Four”), and Corey Burton (Disney)] describe epic &#8211; from sci-fi fantasy to soul-crushing post apocalyptic to grindhouse &#8211; scenarios. (His intro to &#8220;Wake the Dead&#8221; is a thinly veiled reference to the death of the art of DJing – a theme that resonates amongst fellow technically skilled DJs, fans and dance music aficionados.) An inspiration for generations of DJs, Dieselboy’s longevity and relevance in a mercurial industry is a tribute to his relentless drive to create “amazing” experiences for his fans in their iPods and at his infamously explosive live shows.  Dieselboy fans praise his skills as “genius.” Says The Destroyer: “I don’t fuck around.”</p>

Uplink Audio</span></p>
<p>DOWNLINK &#8211; A name firmly cemented in the hearts and minds of the bass music community. He is respected the world over as a p<span class="text_exposed_show">roducer of the highest quality dance floor bangers. He has had numerous #1 hits on Beatport and has released music with major labels like Rottun, OWSLA and Mau5trap. He has helped mix an album for the legendary nu-metal band Korn. He has toured the planet far and wide, leaving a wake of awe-struck audiences in his path. To see him live is to witness one of the tightest technical DJ&#8217;s in the game. His 4 deck live mixing and infectious stage energy light up venues turning crowds on their heads time after time. Expect lightning fast mixing on a journey through a wide variety of bass music. All tempos are fair game as long as its underground vibes and dirty bass. </span></p>

<p>2013 was a huge year for Downlink. Along with homies Excision and KJ Sawka, he gave rise to bass music supergroup Destroid, a whole different kind of live experience altogether. You really have to see it live to fully grasp the scope and intensity of the show. Also in 2013, Downlink launched his brand new record label, Uplink Audio. This will be a place where he will showcase his own music as well as a wide variety of other high grade material. Downlink is not one to be pigeon-holed and is constantly on a quest to evolve and refine his sound. With this in mind, one thing will always remain constant &#8211; a pure unadulterated heavy listening experience…</p>

Play Me Records // One For All // Rad Summer</p>
<p>The jFET Project began in early 2011 by Producer / DJ &#8220;Jangatha.&#8221; After over 50 house music releases on some of the most res<span class="text_exposed_show">pected labels in both digital and vinyl format, the need to seek fresh sounds was instilled and inspired by the edgy bass music arena. The focus is rather simple, to push fresh hype sounds in any BPM it fits best. jFET&#8217;s sounds have been catching on quick. His debut EP reached #15 on the Beatport Dubstep Release charts, and caught the attention of several respected blogs including The Untz. 2012 included a release from Play Me Records as part of the New Blood of Dubstep. With support from international touring acts such as Figure, Ajapai, and Reid Speed, we will likely be hearing much more to come from this eclectic project. jFET: Intergalactic Hitman / Producer / Performer.</span></p>

Deep, Dark &amp; Dangerous // IndyMojo // G-9 Collective</p>
<p>Hailing from Pennsylvania, Rob S. a.k.a. Indigo Child grew up being encouraged to produce his own sound. Starting early, he <span class="text_exposed_show">was a classically trained violinist in his youth. Then he turned to bass guitar for a little more emotion and found himself experimenting with different sounds. He eventually discovered dubstep and that was the beginning of his idea for Indigo Child. Now a member of IndyMojo and G-9 Collective, we have seen him rise up as one of the main dubstep contenders in a talent filled group of DJs. He has played with the likes of Zomboy, Datsik, Bro Safari, Delta Heavy, Caspa, Savoy, Downlink, Vaski, Terravita, Figure, Reid Speed, and many more. In the past two years he has been producing his own tracks and honing in on his own sound. More recently he has caught the attention of New Zealand natives TRUTH, who just dropped one of his tracks on their new label Deep, Dark, Dangerous.</span></p>

<p>Mesmerizing, spellbinding and genre-defying: With their fourth full-length studio release Extras In A Movie, Papadosio reveals a striking cinematic cornucopia of sounds: orchestral, electronic, organic, acoustic, psychedelic and celestial. The 16 selections that comprise the song cycle are concise and structured – launch pads for the improvisational excursions that are a hallmark of the band’s celebrated concert performances.</p>
<p>“The writing process was a challenge for us, to see if we could integrate some songs that were shorter than five minutes,” notes the band. They envisioned the title Extras In A Movie as a concept connected to themes of interpersonal interactions and relationships.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/12688355_10153959008592437_5147495444617332849_n.jpg?oh=d8205817630c5a60ed9d145d38f3d30b&amp;oe=573ED0D9" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hitting virtually all major and secondary U.S. music locales and select festivals across North America, Papadosio tours on a massive scale but maintains a close intimacy with their fans. With the new project they are expanding their collective stylistic palette. “We like to have a lot of colors,” they explain. “We’re starting to push that envelope in the way we want to go – to give the people who are at the shows more of a variety of emotions. We don’t have filters. We record what’s happening.”</p>
<p>Originally from the creative collegiate hotbed of Athens, Ohio, the band is now centered in Asheville, North Carolina. Not that they are homebodies as they clarify. “For the past five or six years we’ve done maybe 150 dates a year and have been gone for 200 days. We were cutting back a little, but now with the new project the number of shows is about to go way back up.”</p>
<p><iframe width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aJPsMvcVKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Extras In A Movie balances Papadosio’s celestial sonic ambience with an organic edge and multiple guitars, both electric and acoustic. “A lot more guitar in general,” they say. “ That’s something new with this record.” What also distinguishes the new music is the prominence of their vocals. Extras In A Movie opens with a dense, harmonic introduction titled “The Last Leaf” and across the span of songs emerges subliminal echoes of prog-rock forefathers like Jethro Tull, Yes and Genesis.</p>
<p>Trippy titles abound: “Gazing the Great Oscillator,” “Moon Entendre,” Anima Mundi.” Noting that these designations often come late in the creative process, if the band can’t find a suitable name, they might invent a word. “Obove” is such a creation. In the lexicon of Papadosio it is a term that references “an over arcing emotion.”</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/12376267_10153866063052437_6967849513944181878_n.jpg?oh=220bebc48587d8c0b496f1362f8d279b&amp;oe=573240F1" alt="" /></p>
<p>While the band gleefully dismisses observations on their collective intellect, an exegesis of their themes indicates complex underpinnings. A new song, “Therian” was inspired by archeological cave paintings depicting creatures that are half-beast and half human. “Bypass Default” is a treatise on being nagged by all of the earth’s problems, and is appropriately discordant. “The Wrong Nostalgia” includes a take on modern radio with the line “Who sold these assholes on the airwaves?” — lyrics with an edge and a bite.</p>
<p>It is the band’s wish that Extras In A Movie will enchant loyal fans and introduce new audiences to the Papadosio universe. “Our intention is to give people music that can be themes in their lives so they can connect to the music. To provide them with a place to hang out so they don’t feel weird in what they are thinking — to give their brains and their hearts a home.”</p>

<p><strong>Dieselboy and Downlink: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/754708614674097/">February 11 at the Mousetrap</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dieselboy/">Dieselboy</a>, Damian Higgins, has come to perfect the world of remixing- none of that awful preprogrammed, prerecorded, press play deejaying. Taking his art past the basics, Dieselboy’s prowess has taken him far past the rest. He has had songs hit Billboard, made the UK’s Drum and Bass Top 10, been featured on magazines, and has even sponsored by DC Shoes and Pioneer Pro DJ. In 2002, Higgins put together his own label, Human Imprint, and co-founded SubHuman under Planet Human. He has played numerous festivals, From Bassrush to Coachella to Shambhala. Internationally renowned, Higgins is now based out of New York, and graces the Mouse Trap in Indy alongside other industry great, Downlink.</p>

<p>Sean Casavant, better known by his stage name <a href="https://www.facebook.com/downlink/">Downlink</a>, is known for how technical his sound is: perfectly controlled, fast, and tempo-equal, as long as there is heavy bass. Four deck live mixing aside, his stage presence is infectious, and have taken him beyond your average remix DJ. Besides working with labels like OWSLA and Rottun, Downlink has worked with Korn and was an integral part of bass supergroup Destroid, along side KJ Sawka and Excision. Also a talented producer, Downlink dropped his album Uplink Audio in 2013, showcasing his skill in all sides of the electronic music world.</p>

<p><strong>Papadosio: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1516291875349763/">February 19 at the Old National Centre</a></strong></p>
<p>Transcendent of genre and normality, <a href="http://papadosio.com/">Papadosio</a> returns to Indianapolis with their newest feat: Extras in a Movie part II. Their music presents more of a feel than a genre, more of a sense than a style, enlightening the brain to music at a different level of experience.<br />
With beginnings in Athens, Ohio, Dosio is now based out of Asheville, North Carolina, albeit they do not spend much time there. Touring more than half the year for the past six years, the Dosio members live on the road, and their fans do almost the same. With one of the strongest followings, Dosio heads follow this group from city to city, doing whatever it takes to get to every show.<br />
Known for their psychedelic shows, Papadosio’s music and light show is nothing less than trippy. They have created their own lexicon, a language spurred from the sound and feel of a song, the members creating words they need as they go. Their music is mesmerizing, and provides listeners with a complete sensory experience, converting listeners to followers at every show.</p>

<p><a href="http://ticketf.ly/1l12Y5L"><strong>Widespread Panic: February 21 at the Old National Centre</strong></a></p>
<p>Going thirty years strong since 1986, Widespread Panic formed as many Southern jam bands do: with a lot of improvisation. Continuing this idea even today, their newest album is focused on that ideal, with most of the songs being live or done in a single take. And, impressive even for thirty years, Widespread Panic has quite the list of accomplishments. They’ve released twelves studio albums and forty three live albums, selling out more venues more frequently than any other group at huge venues, including Red Rocks Amphitheater with 48 sold out shows. They have headlines New Orleans Jazz Fest eight times, along with most other major U.S. festivals, and are part of the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.<br />
There seems to be no stopping them, and there’s no telling what Widespread Panic will do next, but one thing is certain: it will be great.</p>

<p><strong>Business Casual: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/932453340172162/">February 25th at The Mousetrap</a></strong></p>

Business Casual always brings energy onstage and keep the crowd going into the late hours of the night. No need to suit up, this is business casual.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Star Orchestra: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/446028512253978/">February 27 at the Old National Centre</a></strong></p>
<p>The cover band to top all cover bands, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/darkstarorchestra/">Dark Star Orchestra</a> goes way beyond what one would expect, using improvisation to channel their mentor, The Grateful Dead. To say that DSO is just a cover band is a travesty: over 2,000 shows and endless critical acclaim prove just that. They cover entire shows, using historical set lists and mentioning the date and venue of the original event, but utilizing their own unique styling. DSO does not cover songs to mimic the Dead, but instead use their own artistic improvisations to recreate the songs in their own manner. Not intended to be a mere cover band, Dark Star Orchestra goes way beyond the stereotype to be uniquely their own.</p>

<p><strong>Dumpstaphunk w/ Audiodacity: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/951061058319645/">February 27 at the Vogue</a></strong></p>
<p>When you combine tradition and pure, dirty funk, you get a New Orleans born funk band like those of days past: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DumpstaphunkNOLA/">Dumpstaphunk</a>. This five piece arrangement is made up of dueling baselines, keyboard prowess, funky guitar riffs, and, most recently, killer drumming. With three studio albums and plenty of festival slots, Dumpstaphunk takes funk and jazz to a whole new level.</p>
<p><iframe width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LE-fmnULAac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
And who better to open up than Indianapolis based funk powerhouse than <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Audiodacity/">Audiodacity</a>, so far from their beginning as a cover band in 2010. Since realizing their skills could be used for a greater good, Audiodacity came together and began writing their own music in 2011 and ascended to out of state shows in 2013, working up to their debut album. Still up and coming, there is no telling where this sextet will stop.</p>

Initially, he pursued a degree in classical violin, but ended up discovering another passion: electronic music production. Madden combined what he had already learned through his diverse studies in classical music and composition with the world of electronic production, and created his alter ego and musical masterpiece, <a href="http://govindamusic.com/">Govinda</a>.</p>

<p>Self described as gypsy dubtronica, Govinda has evolved into a huge name in both world and electronic music. Madden has played with greats such as Thievery Corporation, Bassnectar, and Shpongle, performed at festivals including South by South West, Lightning in a Bottle, and Coachella, and additionally been featured on more than 25 world music compilations. His sound is uniquely distinct, seamlessly blending elements of electronic, classic, and world music, often with the added bonus of performance art. Frequently, multi sensory features include live projections, gypsy violin, dancing, singing, and even fire spinning.</p>

With the obvious influences—Parliament, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Rick James and Zapp and Roger—as the basis for a recipe, Turkuaz adds healthy doses of Talking Heads inspired jittery, world-pop-dance grooves and a passion for The Beatles, Motown and R&amp;B into the mix, resulting in a refreshing update to the funk idiom.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/v/t1.0-9/10494839_10152481941435872_1384832590160691581_n.jpg?oh=432443dc3653eb07875c0d82d89a8463&amp;oe=571167E0" alt="" /></p>
<p>A universally appealing dance band at its core, Turkuaz’s tightly arranged songs are built on thick grooves, driven by a powerhouse rhythm section and interlaced with swirling guitar lines and synthy keyboard riffs. Over the top, lyrical jabs and swells that serve as both subject matter and rhythmic reinforcement are delivered by four distinct vocalists, framed by horn lines and punctuated with left hooks and right angles. Whereas there are certainly talented improvisers in this extremely musical band, Turkuaz engages bodies and minds with its densely layered compositions, setting the stage for the soaring exploratory guitar and horn solos with no room for noodling. This is perfect for those who want to dance. As for the “headier” crowd showing up for the “jams”—these die hard music lovers are always more than satiated by Turkuaz. They are transported by an irresistible groove, bowled over by a devastating solo and swept up in the impressionistic, occasionally Dadaesque and often seemingly free associative lyrics that—upon closer consideration—reveal unexpected depths of insight, mystery and wry humor in equal parts.</p>
