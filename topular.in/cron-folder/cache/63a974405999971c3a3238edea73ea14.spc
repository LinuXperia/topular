<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he president of the island had been president for nearly nineteen years, and, as was often the case with presidents, many people wanted to kill the president, and some people even had threatened to, and some people even had attempted to, which was why, nineteen years earlier, before the president had even been sworn into office, the president’s advisers had begun searching the island for lookalikes. The president’s advisers insisted that the president have doubles. The president was against having doubles. The president’s appearance wasn’t exactly common or uncommon—beady eyes, a broad nose, full lips, a constellation of moles across the neck. Lookalikes were found. A bank clerk. A mail carrier. A rice farmer. Others. The president’s surgeons reshaped their faces, altered their bodies, tweaked their hairlines, however necessary, and after that the bank clerk and the mail carrier and the rice farmer and the others lived at the president’s mansion, and wore the president’s suits, and dined at the president’s table, with the president. Every day, the president and the doubles would leave the mansion together, lower themselves into separate sedans with separate drivers, and get driven to separate meetings. The president wasn’t convinced that the doubles were necessary. That first year of the presidency, a double was being driven through the city when an anarchist fired a missile at the sedan, totaling the sedan and killing the double. The president didn’t know whether the double killed had been the former bank clerk, the former mail carrier, the former rice farmer, or whoever, but regardless, after that the president was convinced that the doubles were necessary. As was often the case with presidents, the president wanted to avoid assassination. The president had vowed to reform the island, which the president loved. The president often paced the president’s office, brooding about the island’s past, worrying about the island’s future. The president had been born in a hut in the island’s capital, had been scarred across the shins by the island’s reefs as a child, had been educated as an adult by the island’s universities. The doubles, now, had scars across their shins. Sometimes the doubles would appear at official functions, as the president, and would have to give speeches, and make promises, and cast votes on certain issues. That wasn’t a problem. The president wrote the speeches the doubles gave, and chose the promises the doubles made, and instructed the doubles how to vote. Whatever the president said, the doubles did. During the fifth year of the presidency, a double was poisoned with a lemon tart. Also the fifth year of the presidency, a double was poisoned with a milk tea. Also the fifth year of the presidency, a double was poisoned with a tube of toothpaste. The doubles always spoke with the president’s voice, as the doubles had been trained to speak—pronouncing how the president pronounced, enunciating how the president enunciated, speaking at the president’s pitch. The seventh year of the presidency, a double was watching a ballet from a private box at the national theater when an anarchist disguised as an attendant stabbed the double thirteen times with a switchblade stiletto. As the double coughed blood onto the rich carpeting of the private box, the double, in the president’s voice, spoke the double’s dying words. Only the anarchist overheard the double’s dying words. Moments later that anarchist was killed. The island’s healthcare system was improving, the island’s crime rate was decreasing, the island’s economy had recovered from a recession, but nevertheless that ninth year of the presidency the president was shot in the neck while giving a speech at a rally. The president survived, but just barely. After that the president and the doubles were moved from the mansion to a building like a fortress—concrete walls, barred windows—and the doubles themselves were given doubles. Every day, a double and that double’s doubles would leave the fortress together, lower themselves into separate sedans with separate drivers, and get driven to separate meetings. Then another double and that double’s doubles would leave the fortress together, and then another double and that double’s doubles would leave the fortress together, and then another double and that double’s doubles would leave the fortress together. Every few months the anarchists would manage to kill a double, or a double’s double, trying to kill the president, but what the anarchists didn’t know was that the president never left the fortress. The president’s advisers insisted that the president never leave the fortress. The doubles and the doubles’ doubles appeared as the president, wherever the president needed to appear, whenever the president needed to appear. The president had the mind the island needed; the doubles and the doubles’ doubles had the bodies. Sometime in the fifteenth year of the presidency, the president’s advisers thought of a troubling possibility: what if the anarchists themselves made a double, sent the fake double to the fortress, and had the fake double kill the president? After that the doubles and the doubles’ doubles were given separate houses on the island, and nobody was allowed into the fortress, except for the president, who lived there, and a blind servant, who lived there, who cooked the president’s meals and washed the president’s clothes and cleaned the president’s rooms. Deliveries were left at the door. All communication was done over computer. Years passed, and as various doubles were shot, and bombed, and stabbed, and strangled, and poisoned, and bludgeoned, security at the fortress became increasingly heightened—fences were built around the fortress, and guards patrolled the fortress, and rumors were spread that the fortress was now a prison, to mislead the anarchists, but the truth is that it was a prison, that the president lived like a prisoner, that the president ate meals from a tray, and wore the same clothes day after day, and at night often stared out the window of the office, watching the guards on the watchtowers, dreaming of escaping.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>n the day he was cured of his left-handedness by the Good Sisters of St. John, little Frank Lombardi also went cross-eyed. “So the Lord wishes,” Sister Josephine said. It was her hickory switch, along with the Grace of God, that had been the prime mover behind the curing of the boy’s affliction. She had a strong belief in the rightness of the method. There was a time when such a thing would not have been questioned, but the new priest overseeing the parish had proven himself to be skeptical of such practices. He had a taste for photography. Some of the Sisters called him an Episcopalian behind his back.</p>
<p>When Frank arrived home cross-eyed, his mother proclaimed him cursed and blamed herself. She said the source of this curse was the first hands that had touched him out of her womb—those of the Jew doctor. Frank’s father said that she was wrong. Frank had been cursed before he was wrenched from his mother. After all, his father explained, the only reason the doctor was needed was because the boy had a head the size of God’s left testicle. Frank did not understand why this was a sign of his cursedness and not his blessedness. His parents’ superstitions were of a world alien to him, the Old World, where an offering of saffron could summon the saints to intervene in matters earthly and human. Frank’s father, who fled his home when the <em>fascisti</em> finally crumbled, spoke often of the good luck bestowed upon him by the goat he saw in a patch of ryegrass on the day he departed for America on the long steamship.</p>
<p>After Frank went cross-eyed the other boys in the fifth grade at St. John’s called him St. Francis the Afflicted. They liked to ask him what his two miracles were. The first few times this happened Frank tried to think of something funny or clever to say, something to turn the joke back on the other boys. But nothing ever did come to mind and he stood there in silence.</p>
<p>One afternoon at recess, while Frank was kicking over ant hills at the back of the schoolyard, Gene Hacek appeared at his side and said, “St. Francis the Afflicted.” Gene had a fat face and freckles. He walked with his shoulders constantly in motion, the affected strut of a boy who had not learned that the universe had no interest in him.</p>
<p>He said: “Show me a miracle.”</p>
<p>Frank looked at him, or around him, after destroying one last ant hill. This time he did not try to think of anything smart to say. Instead he bent down and picked a gumball-sized rock up from the ground. It did not have a long distance to travel from Frank’s hand to Gene’s eye, and as soon as it connected Gene cupped his palm over the eye and screamed. Frank saw blood drip down the boy’s cheek like a tear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gene Hacek did not strut after Frank Lombardi put out his right eye. He wore a patch over the wound for many weeks. He was taken to a special doctor and fitted for an eye made of glass. When the prosthetic finally arrived and was placed in his skull, it itched terribly. Gene worried often that it would come flying out, which did not happen until his senior year of high school, during a football game, in which Gene was tackled from behind as he ran up the sidelines toward the end-zone. The eye shot forward several yards and landed soundlessly in the grass. Gene heard the crowd shriek and gasp. He found himself thrilled by the thought of it, of being a spectacle of horror to all these people.</p>
<p>When his teammates ran to his side they found him laughing as he lay on his back, the dark orb of his empty socket staring up at them. The boys had of course never seen Gene without his eye, though they all knew that such a state existed, like they knew the dark side of the moon or the Asian continent existed. To some the sight was too much. Mitchell Molloy vomited over his cleats. Bud DiCarlo felt a rock in his throat as if he were about to cry and Dean Marks did cry, though nobody cared to notice. Several of the boys asked if Gene was okay but he only kept laughing. No one thought to retrieve the eye resting a few steps away. Most stood and stared, drop-jawed, until they were pushed away by their coaches.</p>
<p>On the opposing team’s bus ride back home, Henry Sacosky, the boy responsible for Gene’s lost eye, was treated as a hero, the star of the game, though his team had lost and lost soundly. He was christened with a nickname: Sacosky the Killer. This embarrassed him terribly, though he did not ask his teammates to stop until they were dropped off at the school, where their parents waited to take them home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Upon graduation, Henry enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at the encouragement of his father, a veteran of the European theater of World War II. Henry’s nickname eventually found him at boot camp by way of a letter, carelessly left in public view, from a high school friend. The name hit the ears of his sergeant and his life became miserable. The sergeant took it upon himself to prove that Henry was not a killer and was doing a fine job of it until one calm and cloudless night the sergeant’s heart exploded in his sleep. Henry was at the time in his bunk dreaming of the many girls from home he’d failed to slip himself into. He was a virgin and, because there was a war on, feared he would die one.</p>
<p>He would not though. Vietnam would hold many firsts for Henry. It was his first war, for instance, as well as his first woman. His first marijuana cigarette. His first helicopter and rice paddy. It was, in some ways, a good time for him. This was, at least, what he wrote home and what he would say to his children not many years later, the woman and marijuana scrupulously omitted.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, Henry was given a tomahawk with which he killed a man. The man Henry killed was a member of a party of Vietnamese who ambushed Henry’s platoon. After a series of events that he could describe only with the most imprecise details—gunfire coming from 360 degrees around their position, the movement of bodies, screaming voices he recognized and screaming voices he didn’t—Henry found himself in close combat with the man, whose face was streaked with blood. The tomahawk entered the man at the base of his neck and a spurt of his blood hit Henry’s eye. It stung slightly. Several hours later he noticed dark specks in his vision. Blood dried in his eyelashes. He brushed it out with his fingers. For his actions, he received a ribbon.</p>
<p>He came back from the war. He married. He joined a union, bought a house, built a fence. Avoided politics and Asian restaurants. Dreamt he was blind. Dreamt he was a high school virgin with no legs. Chopped wood for the fireplace. Slept naked with his wife. Became a supervisor, buttoned his collar, put a pool in the backyard. He had a son. Had a daughter. Dreamt he was screaming through someone else’s mouth. Played billiards twice a week. Dreamt. Never drank in the house. Never raised his voice. Except once. When his son, James, found several notes addressed to Sacosky the Killer in one of Henry’s old yearbooks and said, “Daddy’s a killer, daddy’s a killer,” over and over again until it made his sister cry.</p>
<p>Henry heard this and yelled at James to stop. The boy listened, but he did not know what had upset his father. He knew only that he hated him for yelling. He went outside and threw rocks at a tree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
James attended elementary school at the School of the Sacred Heart, a place very similar to the school once attended by little Frank Lombardi, who gave Gene Hacek the need for a glass eye, which James’s father knocked out with a fine tackle on the twenty-yard line. James was left-handed, like Frank, but by this time all of the nuns at the School of the Sacred Heart had been replaced by lay teachers who did not see the Devil in left-handedness.</p>
<p>One of his classmates was a girl called Lee Ann Marsh whose straw-colored hair and tall, skinny frame gave her the look of an upturned mop. She walked with her head down and shoulders turned in. James and his friends often threw things at her. He did not give much thought to it. Throwing things at Lee Ann Marsh was merely what one did at the School of the Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>She often cried, but not when pencils or erasers or bits of broken chalk were chucked at her. Her tears came at odd moments—at the start of the perfunctory religion class after recess or when Miss Cunningham asked her to read an exercise from the phonics book. It made James dislike her. He didn’t see the use of it, all that crying.</p>
<p>Lee Ann disappeared after she threw Susie Gruebler to the ground by her hair and bloodied her nose with a fist. She wasn’t seen again until James’s junior year of high school, by which time the diocese had closed the School of the Sacred Heart and razed the building. He and all of Lee Ann’s former classmates were now at the public high school. Not much was made of her return. She’d been forgotten and would remain so until she became pregnant by an unknown man. A favorite joke among boys that year was to say to their friends, “Are you and Lee Ann to be married?” or “Was it worth it?” and other such things. Sometimes James told these jokes, other times he was the butt of them. His favorite variation was to say, “Don’t ask me to be the godfather” to one of his buddies, because of its subtlety. He was very proud of that joke.</p>
<p>When news reached James a few years later that Lee Ann had been killed in a collision with a tractor trailer on Route 19 he did not know who she was. “You remember,” Bill Lancaster, who’d seen it in the paper, told him over the phone. “Tall girl, not much to look at, always getting in trouble. Had a kid.”</p>
<p>Though he still did not know who Bill was referring to, James said, “Her, right.”</p>
<p>After they hung up James retrieved his Class of 1988 mug from his cabinet, which had the names of the entire graduating class printed around it in miniscule white letters. He used a magnifying glass to search the names, but could not find any Lee Ann Marsh. He decided that Bill had been mistaken about what he saw in the paper. Whoever the dead woman was, he didn&#8217;t have any connection to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">#</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Before she was killed by a speedhead trucker coming onto the interstate by way of an off-ramp, Lee Ann Marsh gave birth to a boy named Sam. He grew up fat and quiet and nearsighted. At school he was called fatty and four-eyes, but this did not bother him because the tags on his clothes did not say “fatty” or “four-eyes,” but “husky,” which brought to mind images of bearded, barrel-chested men in plaid, and this Sam liked very much.</p>
<p>After his mother died Sam was put up for adoption because the man who made him was a drunk and had a taste for hitting Sam’s mother when she was alive. His father’s name was Charles. On Sam’s eighteenth birthday Charles showed up at his house and bloodied the nose of Sam’s adoptive father for threatening to call the police. Then he took Sam with him to a strip club. “What do you think?” he asked Sam.</p>
<p>Sam said that it stunk. And it did. Of smoke and urine.</p>
<p>Charles slipped a folded dollar into a woman’s cleavage. “Met your mother here,” he said and smiled.</p>
<p>Sam broke a highball glass across Charles’s forehead. A wash of blood spilled down his face. Sam cut his own hand on the glass and the blood of each dripped to the floor.</p>
<p>Many years later, Sam was alone and his eyesight was terrible. Each morning before leaving for work he’d lay in bed for an hour hugging his pillow. On one such morning, he left his house and found dew and a strange bug on his car’s windshield. The little creature resembled a praying mantis, only it was white and much smaller. Sam thought of throat-singing monks and green tea and temples perched on jagged fog-cloaked mountainsides. As he left his driveway, he turned on his wipers to clear off the moisture and the bug was pushed to side of the windshield. The creature’s spindly limbs writhed and its body, torn and mangled, clung to his car. Sam watched the bug and said, <em>No, no, please, no, just fall off, oh God, no, I</em><em>’</em><em>m sorry</em>, as he drove, crying.</p>
<p>In this way the life carried on for some time until it ended, screaming.</p>

<p>Like all museums, no one visits. This keeps out the riffraff and their dust, the unpeopling that collects on the exhibits and the smooth plastic of the monitors. Pedestrians outside are bound at the waist with leather—to keep the stuffing in. Joke: If you’ve ever had anyone ask you to pull the stick from your rear end, you’re probably not a scarecrow. And yet, almost invariably are sticks so far up scarecrows’ asses that they’re structural. Missed opportunity, but no one wants to be seen mocking a scarecrow because they’re good, hard-working Americans.</p>
<p>The figurative is preferred to the literal—clouds in the shape of branches, which is why some birds don’t come down until flapping themselves out. Joke: All the scarecrows go to college, and the college catches fire. Joke: By the time the diploma’s loans are paid off, all the crows are dead, the clouds burned up.</p>
<p>The scarecrows will outlast us with their eternal eyes of O, O on cloth, cloth on straw. Joke: We dress the straw man. The eyes are caricatures but whatever, a crow doesn’t know the keen-eyed sunk-cheeked farmer from the bloated sack washed up on waves of grain. That crow is racist as fuck.</p>
<p>Joke: Why do scarecrows make bad babysitters? Because they’re all on fire. The institutions, too, on fire and the rain doesn’t come around anymore. If there is such a machine as wind, we don’t want to know it. If the world spins out of control, it’s only because it’s trying to shake us. If the crows fall from the sky directly onto our plates, we won’t eat them. Nor should we, we joke.</p>
<p>By matter of ceremony, the exhibits swell with fluorescent light between the hours of 10 and 6. The scarecrows’ shadows blend into each other, wings unfurling. You’re flying, says the father lifting his little girl horizontal to the road under her, past the museum door and toward the grocer who is near-blind but knows the fruit by its give to his touch. The joke is not that all the crows are dead—though they are—it’s that the museum is still here, and unattended, and every evening the ceilings raise slightly, pulling the shadows a little tighter.</p>

<p><em>Headline from Feb. 2011</em></p>
<ol>
<li>It’s not about the dogs, but control. That you should learn to tame the untamed. That to let your pit bull ride shotgun is one step removed from handing over the keys. Barking, fine. That can be controlled. As can you.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you invited me inside to meet your new baby, I would come in. I would tread lightly on the floorboards, I would ignore your unkempt hair and rustblood birthscent, and that your scraggly chicken infant in his carrier has just shat himself. I would murmur, Beautiful, lovely, beautiful.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Only once have I been invited inside a house on my route. Twenty years past and I still cannot talk about it.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Some children toddle down the sidewalk, impatient parents dragging them by one arm. These adults glower, eye-circled and minimally attentive, unwilling to accept the importance of even the junk mail. The life-saving products and offers such mail contains.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>What you worried I saw through the parted curtains: I saw. I will not tell unless I need to. Who can say what need is?</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Upon viewing tattoos on forearms and calves, I used to think, Wastrel, trash. Now I see cave pictures made flesh. Absence and sorrow.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>A decrease in Book-of-the-Month selections lightens my load and weighs on my mind. I adored <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. I delighted in Nabokov. Daily I show my age, a trouble that does not cease.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>The boots are comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>I make up stories about the shut-ins. Who among us has not wondered if the rumors about Dead Harry are true? That his plumbing broke and his knees didn’t work so the bathtub became a toilet. I saw the man from the realtor’s cleaning service, retching on the lawn.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li>All the gossips are lonely. Deep, deeper, deeply. A loneliness of the soul.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>Planting flower beds here or there wouldn’t kill you. Nothing too showy. This is my backdrop, my office.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>It was not the war, not overseas, not in uniform. But I was part of two battles. They did not tell us where we were. We met the man we were instructed to terminate. We shook his hand, we smiled into his face. We gave him a two-hour head start. This was practice, they said. Brave faces, they said. Warrior hearts, we chanted.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
<li>When I put the third letter in your box upside-down:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is my way of saying</p>

<p>A few seconds under the past’s broil,<br />
I left roofs to boys. Girl I was</p>
<p>always afraid, untouched, finger<br />
banged, hugged too clumsy-rough. Move</p>
<p>your sex, said sister. Taste and see,<br />
congregation sang to Father John, achy</p>
<p>breaky hymns, hairy hunky haunched, anyone</p>
<p>limbed I wanted wet yesterday of<br />
ordinary time. He could wear green Umbros,</p>
<p>gluey hands, smell like Great White Shark<br />
fruit snacks. He could mouth his lips, slap</p>
<p>bracelet my heart. I was gather and cathedral<br />
calories, bagged wafers, wash chalice, suede</p>
<p>choker, wooden T, pinch the blood-gulp, dozing Christ. He waited</p>
<p>to spring awake. He writhed and worked<br />
my sins, an extra lap</p>
<p>around the mall. Outside lithe bustles I never<br />
became. Polished. Women, please</p>
<p>have me. O use your bruisey boots, purple, punkish, green,<br />
oil and mud and hair dye draining, and, ooh</p>
<p>wash away my glitter and Jello-juice, Dad’s<br />
gaskets, a hurricane lassies do not make.</p>
<p>One pipe, one gear, plastic crack adventure, wishes and scabs.</p>
<p>Fantasy of gal-palling<br />
with anyone, dark-haired, ghoul-eyed,</p>
<p>summer camp, bunkbed singalongs, horrorshocks, gleeped chocolate<br />
gulped grog, scritched mosquitos, kisses, bloodpooling. Badness</p>
<p>shook her finger, pointy, pointy knife. I spread<br />
these thighs for myself, girl</p>
<p>I trained myself to loathe, like, gag-me pickled beets or eeny meeny teeny weenie short short man</p>
<p>I blushed off callers, brushed<br />
back hair. Smooth crowns</p>
<p>belonged to the others, that<br />
bubble-lettered group.</p>
<p>What will it take to belong, to quit<br />
wanting a slab of swaggy layer cake?</p>
<p>Do I swipe frosting and offer it up?</p>
<p>Mary, my pinky.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>oot patrols through Baghdad were slow. Nothing but time to think about sniper sightlines and IEDs hidden in the trash. We gridded the streets in our AO and sidestepped sewage-puddling ditches. Three months in, one block became our favorite. There were fewer adobe-like farmhouses, and beyond them lay the rural red-sanded expanse of the desert. The stagnant heat reminded me of running the firebreak roads at Camp Mackall during SFAS Team Week. I had twelve months to go, a full year to imagine a violent death on a repeating loop. I wanted to make it to my twenty-first birthday so I could walk into a liquor store back home in Fort Worth and buy my old man a nice bottle of Scotch, thank him for loving me, for sending me letters every week.</p>
<p>In our favorite neighborhood lived an Iraqi with a thick black mustache. We called him Steve Harvey. He laughed at everything we said. Steve’s neighbors mostly hid behind curtains or darkened their doorways. But Steve was always outside waiting for us, standing beside sunrotten Mazda and Nissan sedans or compact Deer and Grand Tiger Chinese pickup trucks that I’d never heard of. What marked Steve’s neighborhood as Shiite were the newer Chevrolet Trailblazers, what we called Monicas, and Toyota Mark II sedans, called Ducks.</p>
<p>Regardless of the danger, Steve welcomed us with his smile. He owned a date orchard that hadn’t been leveled by bulldozers to make way for a COP or razed by air support or Iranian shaped charges. Steve would hold a basket on his hip and offer fruit as we walked by. The first time he did this we asked him in raised voices to put the basket down and step away from it. We had to be sure he wasn’t gonna detonate. In the following months, Steve became a fixture on patrol. We took his fruit, but no one ate it. No one wanted to take diarrhea to the portables. Several blocks later we’d toss the dates into ditches or feed them to emaciated goats that hooved the pocked streets sundrunk and dazed.</p>
<p>Steve’s son, maybe nine or ten, hadn’t yet joined a militia or been claimed by a random and final burst of violence. We called him Carlos II because Specialist Foster said he looked like the Mexican busboy named Carlos he had worked with at Olive Garden in high school, watercolored mustache and all.</p>
<p>We took to Carlos II, his bright face and kind brown eyes. Most kids who ran beside our patrols and convoys were nuisances: unwashed, cadaverous children pawing for candy and chocolate. They were the ones who might detonate. We mostly tossed them our ratfucked MREs. But Carlos II was different; he didn’t ask us for anything. Like his father, he gave us the feeling that maybe he wouldn’t want to kill us after his balls dropped. So we brought him our care package castoffs and items we got at the MWR. One of our translators, whom we called Billy the Kid for no good reason, told us to be discreet about this, to not show too much favoritism to Carlos II.</p>
<p>But we didn’t think much of being kind to Carlos II. He was our buddy. Being kind to him seemed to fit the MO. As part of the surge, commanders gave militia leaders stacks of cash each week for cooperation. With their support we were to be a calming presence, but we still kicked in doors and zip-stripped insurgents and easily made enemies as the months wore on. Our days were uneasy calm before quick engagements. You simply hoped to be whole when the sand settled.</p>
<p>Then we lost Lieutenant Moritz. For some reason his death hit the hardest. He had a little girl on the way, lots of guys did, but he seemed like he would have been the best father in the world. Moritz reminded me of my dad even though he was twenty-six. Took care of us the way he prized the daughter he would never meet. The whole unit moped for the rest of the deployment. There was no getting over Moritz. Two weeks after Mortuary Affairs shipped him to Delaware and then on to Texas, we found ourselves handing out hundreds of soccer balls donated by FC Dallas, the MLS team Moritz had worked for before he joined up. He had sent an email to their PR girl two weeks before he was killed. He asked for a donation, anything they could send. When the soccer balls arrived and we got the okay to hand them out, that was a fucking sad day, rolling those soccer balls out on the same streets where Moritz had lost his heart after ball bearings from an IED pulped the middle of his chest. For a day or two all those kids were happy, and we couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>After Moritz every day felt like war. If he could die so could you. God hated a favorite, that’s what we said. Captain Graham, the chaplain, would see most of us after patrol. All the neighborhoods turned against us. Every plastic bag was an IED. Guys you ate with were getting blown up across the city, including Specialists Davis and Stevens in our unit. We lost Steve Harvey and Carlos II, easy targets of one of their neighbors who burst from a door across the street and released a spray of AK fire before they could take cover. We neutralized the gunman, dropped him before he could advance up range, but by then our only friends in the city were gone.</p>
<p>None of us wanted to see Carlos II and his dad, loose dates outlining their bodies. I was sick of seeing dead kids up close. Back at the MWR we had a small ceremony. We ate sleeves of Fig Newtons because they were the closest we had to dates. We grew mustaches in their honor, and from then on we helped Baghdad get shittier every day. Like the Iraqis, all we wanted was for the war to stop, for all parties to part ways. All we had to do was survive our last few months and wait to cycle home, where the things that kept us alive would be the things we hid from when we got there.</p>
<p>I was carded when I got that bottle of Scotch. I didn’t have the words to tell my old man how I felt about him, so I just gave him the brown-bagged bottle. Joy was a requirement for the words I needed.</p>
<p>Dad let me move in with him. Together we’d make sure the couch didn’t float away when I got home from the recruitment office at the mall. The television lit our faces at night, but my mind was elsewhere, in Baghdad. I listened for Moritz’s riotous laugh. I’d think about his little girl, maybe pigtailed by now. I’d run PT around the FOB with Davis and Stevens. I’d think about colorful sunsets that made the desert sparkle. I’d think of Steve Harvey and Carlos II, and hope wherever they were, whatever afterlife they were given, they’d be there together. That would seem to be enough for anybody.</p>

<p>You knew me first as a craving;<br />
rose hip stew simmered brown<br />
over peppered crayfish– I smelled life<br />
on the windows, grandmother shifting stories<br />
into steam, walls summer-slick<br />
beneath peeling yellow paper.</p>
<p>I whispered in your cold-<br />
pressed ear, your stethoscope, I warbled you<br />
a litany. I kicked you<br />
in the rib over the julbord, holly grove and caged<br />
bird: you felt my roots spread. Felt the tide<br />
rise in your stomach.</p>
<p>We met at the solstice, over lingonberries<br />
and sweet golden Pommac. I split your body,<br />
two hemispheres of home, one little moon<br />
tethered to a planet. I know<br />
what your heart sounds like<br />
from the inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>G6: The East Coast News </strong></p>
<p>We lived in a place where cable didn’t exist. Our water was pumped from a well, our electricity streaming in on a TVA river wave. We lived in Izard County, Arkansas, where dirt roads ribboned through hills, where people were all but waiting on a filmmaker to document their poverty.</p>
<p>But we had a satellite dish in our front yard. A marvel of engineering, a jellyfish puffing toward the sky. Its frame stiff, shiny, a monument to mass communication. According to my father, we were devotees of manufacturing, people who made an art out of industry. The satellite dish, the Buick, the trailer—our lives made of metals.</p>
<p>We were a space-age family, my father liked to say.</p>
<p>He was an expert dish adjuster, a champion of signal. A skill born of practice, dedication, more than science. Out there in our front yard, in the space between fat oak trees, my father shaped masterpieces, our dish&#8217;s antenna locked onto distant targets, sending pristine picture to our television—we watched until our eyes ached.</p>
<p>My mother died during the motherly act—that’s how my father always explained it. He was fifty years old when I was born. He cooked for the catfish buffet over in Strawberry. He liked to wear an old fireman’s coat to the restaurant, chemistry goggles strapped around his head. He looked like a villain from one of the Mexican dramas piped in through the satellite. He looked like a fellow with an obscure but absolute capacity for destruction. <strong>   </strong></p>
<p>In the mornings, before I left for school, we’d angle the TV so we could see from the breakfast room. We usually watched the East Coast news, places that seemed fathomable only in two colorful dimensions, weather-map geography. My father liked to hear horror stories of the human variety, robberies and rapes and murders. He said that we needed to hear them, that it was healthy to be reminded of how ugly people could be.</p>
<p>I would listen to the somber tone of broadcasters, their words drowned out by the sizzle, the pop, of fried meats. My father would pull baskets of food from the deep fryer, plugs of meat and potatoes, all of it soggy, grease dripping down your cuticles before dripping down your throat.</p>
<p>“What are we eating today?” I’d ask.</p>
<p>“Cheetah meat,” he’d say.</p>
<p>One morning the two of us were sitting there, staring at a weather map of New York, when my father said, “Looks like a heat wave’s headed this way.”</p>
<p>I looked at the map. The high in Buffalo was sixty-seven degrees.</p>
<p>My father walked into the kitchen, grabbed a pair of scissors usually used to clip fat away from meat. He came back and faced away from me, staring at the TV. He raised the fat-caked scissors and cut into the shoulder of his plaid shirt, circling his bicep until he’d detached the sleeve. He unbuttoned the cuff and pulled the sleeve off, tossing it onto the kitchen table next to my plate.</p>
<p>He was halfway through the other sleeve when he said, “Stand up, Edmund. We’ve got some wardrobe adjustments to make.”</p>
<p>I was fifteen years old, and I listened to everything he said. I stepped in front of him, and he appraised my clothes—a pair of khaki pants that were tight in the crotch, an oversized plaid shirt I’d taken from his closet.</p>
<p>He examined my shoulder, looking back and forth, right then left. He raised the scissors and snipped above my collar-bone, gaining speed as he worked the scissors around my arm. He tugged the sleeve off my arm and dropped it to the linoleum. I stood there quietly while he cut fabric from the rest of my limbs.</p>
<p>Now, so many years later, it seems like my father’s eccentricity deepened weekly during the last year of his life. I still have the satellite chart that hung over the mantle of our faux fireplace. Its markings are celestial, dots and pins angled into shapes, an astronomy of soap operas and sporting events, foreign films and public hearings. My father’s scribbles crowd the edges, noting his favorite satellites, his preferred signals. It’s easy to detect the absurdity, the nihilism, of sickness in his behaviors, his obsessions. But back then my father could tell me anything, and it was the truth. That, I’ve come to think, was my father’s supreme illness: omniscience.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>F2: Tennis</strong></p>
<p>Tennis was always on, if not on a North American satellite then on one from Sweden or Bulgaria. My father admired the sport for its uniforms, the tight shirts and short shorts and high socks. I tried to take up tennis. While other boys my age were mastering their skills with chainsaws, fistfighting on the bank of the river, I attended tennis practice, where I tiptoed across weed-cracked courts, swatted the air with my racket, the ball lofting gently over the net to my coach, a man with a delicate beard whose loneliness surpassed his interest in my tennis skills. He’d stop halfway through a match to tell me what he’d purchased at the supermarket, to talk about cleaning out his gutters.</p>
<p>One afternoon I watched television from a folding chair while my father stood behind me with a hair clipper. Onscreen was a tennis match, a couple of European men with scrawny arms and hairy legs slapping the ball back and forth, their shoes chirping on the court.</p>
<p>I sat there patiently, my father mowing a row of hair every once in a while. I could sense his distraction, the tennis match getting more attention than my hair.</p>
<p>“Be careful around my ears,” I said.</p>
<p>“Shit, that ball wasn’t anywhere close to the line.”</p>
<p>He began cutting with a bit more vigor, the blade tugging my hair, releasing it.</p>
<p>“I have a scar from last time,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re being dramatic,” he said. “Cartilage hardly scars.”</p>
<p>“Is this match point?” I asked. I’d been playing the sport for a year and still struggled with the subtleties of scoring. The European broadcasts hardly helped matters.</p>
<p>My father moved in front of me, lifting my chin to look at me.</p>
<p>“This may be my best work yet,” he said. “I’ve highlighted your McEnroe qualities. Long enough to be rebellious but not so long as to affect your performance. Style and substance—that’s the ticket, Edmund.”</p>
<p>I heard the screen door swing open, heard someone padding toward us across the trampled carpet.</p>
<p>“Is it time to go already?” my father asked.</p>
<p>“It’s ten till five,” a female voice said. “I don’t want to listen to Randy bitch.”</p>
<p>It was Annette Meyer, a girl so pretty she made my breastbone ache, a quarter-sized pain that lasered through to the meat of my back. She had buck teeth, an almond-shaped dimple in her chin, black hair so thick it must’ve strained the muscles in her neck. She had a couple of years on me in school, and she had the rumors to keep me sleepless at night, squirming around in the heat of my sheets. She waited tables at the fish restaurant and often walked the mile to our place to ride to work with my father.</p>
<p>She stepped in front of me, stood next to my father. I kept my eyes down—she was too much to take in up close. These glimpses of her outside of school seemed thick with intimacy, with private knowledge—her high heels replaced by a pair of worn Asics. Her scent—Dial soap and bug spray—made my hormones roar.</p>
<p>She stared at me for a long moment, what felt like minutes, before she said, “It’s a little bit lopsided.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is,” my father agreed.</p>
<p>“He has expressive eyebrows,” she said. “Sort of like a young Louis de Funes.”</p>
<p>She’d spoken about me before speaking to me. I’d never heard of Louis de Funes, but the name, spoken from those lipstick-thick lips, somersaulted between my ears.</p>
<p>When the two of them left, I sat there looking at the television, listening to the whap of tennis rackets.</p>
<p><strong>F4: The Sex Channels</strong></p>
<p>The mailman was a woman who wasn’t my mother. On the weekends my father would travel with her to Memphis. While he was gone, I’d spend most of my time in front of the television. One of the few frequencies I’d memorized was the F4 satellite—it delivered the sex channels to our living room. Watching them was like witnessing the events of a history that hadn’t happened yet. Those onscreen bodies, slick with sweat and oil and other barely fathomable lubricants, popped together with gaudy pleasure. The women panted raspy falsettos, the men grunting from time to time.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call what I experienced watching the sex onscreen arousal, not exactly. Not compared to what I felt in the company of Annette. I was inured to the television, having spent so much of my life in front of it. My father said porn was a performance in which every moment was the culmination, the event we’d been waiting for. He said it was drama without the tedium of context, that it transcended the cause-effect paradigm. And nothing was more important to a boy’s development than the abandonment of narrative morality, my father told me.</p>
<p>Late Sunday evenings, my father and the mailman would come home with bleary eyes and stiff bodies. My father, who talked about everything, who was incapable of discretion, never said much about Memphis. At the time I hardly gave it a thought, but over the years I’ve come to wonder if he didn’t want to tell me what he was doing. Whether he was up to something he shouldn’t have been or he was doing something that embarrassed him, whether he was seeking some kind of medical treatment.</p>
<p>“What’s Memphis like?” I would ask, when he returned.</p>
<p>“Elvis and disco and pisspots,” he’d say.</p>
<p><strong>F1: French Cinema</strong></p>
<p>Annette came over more often in those last months of my father’s life. When my father stopped driving, she got her license, started driving her mother’s kelp Ambassador. The car was low and wide, a raft over the dirt roadway, and as she drove, gravel pinged into the undercarriage, her tires spraying the shoulders with a wake of grit.</p>
<p>Annette clung to my father like he was jarred firefly, like she better savor his every blink, absorb his last light. I did not share her awareness, her sensitivity. My antenna was focused on Annette. She’d all but moved in with us. At first she slept on the couch, a thin t-shirt stretched over her beautiful knees. I coveted that curving cotton, stretched taut over her thin body. I hurt for her, with vigor and virginity, my blood humming in her presence, my jaws grinding in their sockets.</p>
<p>They spent evenings in front of the television, the satellite tuned to a station that played French films. They’d sit on the couch Indian style, their knees rubbing, pretending to play the roles they saw onscreen, interpreting the lines. They’d laugh at the dramatic moments, the expressive faces of the actors. Sometimes I’d march up to the recliner and plop down, as though it was nothing to have Annette Meyer right there next to me.</p>
<p>But I could hardly breathe. I certainly couldn’t talk. I’d stare at the screen. The French people communicating big feelings. The depth, the emotion of their faces, the fluttery octaves of their voices—I wasn’t sure I would have understood even if I were a Frenchman.</p>
<p>It’s still difficult to fathom Annette’s presence in our living room. Sure, she pined for our television, for the international programming, but it was always more than that. My father had a way of bringing the world, the things he wanted, close to him. Perhaps it is naive of me, but I believe, even now, that nothing more than companionship passed between them. That they were simply magnificent friends, people who shared a sensibility, who bonded as they breaded fish filets.</p>
<p><strong>G1: Politics of the Soviet Union</strong></p>
<p>One night we watched the live broadcast of a Soviet congressional debate. The Soviets argued with dramatic hand gestures, flecks of spittle bursting from their lips.</p>
<p>“This is beautiful,” my father kept repeating. “This is governance. These men know what it means to be powerful.”</p>
<p>“It’s so erotic,” Annette said, and then she and my father looked at me, laughed together. My father’s lungs hocked, he laughed so hard.</p>
<p>Annette acted strangely all night, sexualizing programming that was otherwise sterile. Weather reports and suitcase infomercials, even the off-air rainbow stripes. The clipped accents of the Soviets were steady, reassuring somehow, and I fell asleep, while my father and Annette mumbled to each other. I woke up with Annette on my lap, my nose pinched between her thumb and forefinger, my pants clumped at my ankles. She pushed me to the couch, pulled her skirt up her haunches, settled down on top of me. She pummeled me with her pelvis.</p>
<p>When I finished, she leaned back, rested on her arms, and looked at me. Then she raised her leg and kicked me. Her heel cracked my nose, blood filling my nostrils. She dragged my pants up from my shoes and led me to the bathroom. Blood gummed over my lips, crusted onto my shirt. She soaked a rag in warm water and gently scrubbed my face. She stroked the rag along my chin, wiping away the matted blood. I was lightheaded with pleasure, with confusion, with pain.</p>
<p>“I love you,” I said.</p>
<p>I’ve said those words so many times since then, but that was, as far as I can remember, the first time I’d uttered them.</p>
<p>“I’ll slice you to pig meat if you tell anyone,” she said, and then she left me with the blood-soaked rag.</p>
<p>At the time I assumed that Annette shared my strong feelings, but in the days that followed she went back to ignoring me, snuggling up to my father on the couch, the two of them whispering jokes again. And after he died, she stopped coming over altogether. Last I heard, she was a draftswoman for an architectural firm in Little Rock.</p>
<p>For a while I wondered if my father put her up to it. If the sex was their way of distracting me, consoling me before I even needed consolation. And there was the other possibility, too—that she was the one who needed distraction. That she was avoiding her own sadness about my father’s waning health, his shriveling figure.</p>
<p>Over time I came to believe her reasons hardly mattered. I came to believe that Annette was a medium through which I communicated with my father, our love for one another channeled through her. How separate he and I were, always. He had his own kind of gravity, a force that pulled me into orbit, closer and closer, before I stabilized into rotation, circling him at a distance, never close enough to collide.</p>
<p><strong>G3: Dobro Jutro, Croatia</strong></p>
<p>This is what I remember of my father’s death: that it happened during the leftover broadcast of a Croatian morning show. The anchor was a blond woman with a boy’s haircut, a white dress gripping her body like cling wrap. The show had ended, and she was seated on a beige couch, eating noodles from an oversized bowl.</p>
<p>I called my father’s name—he liked leftover footage, and he liked blond women.</p>
<p>A crew member entered the frame, headset clasping his neck. He spoke to someone offscreen.</p>
<p>I called my father’s name again. The crew member approached the couch. Then he leaned over, kissed the woman on the cheek.</p>
<p>I waited for my father to come back, as he always did, to the television.</p>
<p><strong>F4: The Pittsburgh Pirates</strong></p>
<p>When I asked my father why he’d quit the restaurant, he told me that the grease spoke to him, a language of sizzles and pops. That one day, as he stood over the fryer, the grease finally said, “Stop.” It was important to listen to the messages the world delivered, he said.</p>
<p>He stopped cooking altogether, even at home. I was left with frozen lunches and store-bought sandwich meat, with white bread and mayonnaise. For a while my father craved salads. The mailman brought over heads of lettuce, stacked them in the refrigerator. My father peeled the leaves apart and ate them one ragged layer at a time, dipping them into saucers of ranch dressing. One day I opened the refrigerator and found a single rotting head, its leaves brown and shriveled as pond weeds.</p>
<p>“When’s the mailman coming over?” I asked. “You need some lettuce.”</p>
<p>“I’m done with the mailman,” he said, “and I’m done with food.”</p>
<p>He had quit eating, altogether. He looked like a dogwood during winter.</p>
<p>He spent most of his time in front of the television then, but he’d stopped adjusting the satellite, stopped changing the channel. He settled for mainstream programming I knew he despised—cop shows and legal dramas and baseball. He’d point to the screen and say things like, “This is vulgar, watching these Americans butcher their own game. If I were a player, I’d go play in Japan. Now that’s baseball, their movements measured and precise. Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates—this is like watching overgrown schoolboys flail around, their swings all muscle, their throws all shoulder. American players don’t have the inner peace necessary to play pretty baseball.”</p>
<p>Every once in a while I’d find him sucking on coffee beans, pouched in his bottom lip, mouth swollen like a light-hitting center fielder.</p>
<p><strong>G4: Dallas</strong></p>
<p>I’d come home from school hoping to watch reruns of <em>Dallas,</em> and my father had taken me into the front yard, to the foot of our satellite dish. This was about six months before he died. We stared up at the sweeping rim of the dish. It was the first time I’d seen it up close. It was big. It sprouted between trees like a giant flower, a steel lily. My father had never summoned me down there. He had always handled the dish on his own—his attentions to it crucial to his parenting philosophy.</p>
<p>“Why are we here?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We had a storm last night,” he said. “The dish is off balance.”</p>
<p>It looked fine to me, though I didn’t know what to look for. My father placed his hand on the rim of the dish and held it there, as though he were taking its pulse.</p>
<p>“How do we straighten it out?” I asked.</p>
<p>He just stood there, staring past the dirt road, into the broad field of sage across from our property. He seemed to be considering something vast and unknowable, how our television reception was impacted by the steady expansion of the universe, maybe. I waited for him to say it to me. I waited for him to deliver one of his theories, one of those clever avoidances I’d been told all my life.</p>
<p>“Should I crank this handle?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m dying,” he said.</p>
<p>I nodded, but I didn’t believe him. I’m not sure I ever believed that he was dying; it was always so difficult to distinguish between his truth and the truth. Only in time would I understand that, standing there in the matted weeds below the dish, my father had delivered a truth unsullied, that he’d sent the message as clearly as he could.</p>
<p>“I am going to show you how to do this,” he said. He aligned the dish with a distant barn, and then began cranking the handle. The dish tilted back, squeaking as it reclined. “We’re trying to connect to the G4 satellite. You know where the G4 satellite is—you’ve seen it on the chart.”</p>
<p>I watched while his forearm circled, the antenna angling toward the afternoon sun.</p>
<p><strong>G2: Figure Skating</strong></p>
<p>We were watching figure skating. A girl with tiny arms and hammy thighs skated around the rink, rising from the ice in spinning flourishes. My father lay on the couch, coming in and out of sleep. Annette sat at his feet, flipping through a design magazine, occasionally glancing up at the screen.</p>
<p>“I don’t really like skating,” she said. “How do you know the judges aren’t cheating?”</p>
<p>My father raised his head. “Trick sports are the purest form of athletic pursuit,” he said. “There are no rules confining the athletes. They are bound only by the limits of their bodies and their imaginations.”</p>
<p>And then we lost signal. The screen turned blue, its bewildering light shading our walls. None of us acknowledged the loss out loud. It seemed an impossibility, the three of us in that living room without any signal.</p>
<p>I knew what needed to be done. I went outside, walked toward the dish. I wasn’t as skilled as my father, but signal had become my responsibility, my contribution. When I reached the satellite, I cranked the handle, adjusted the angle of the receiver. I checked the living room window, hoping to see flashes of color, but the glass was tinted blue. I pushed the dish around, aimed its antenna across the sky, and still the blue remained. When I found nothing, when it seemed like I’d exhausted every starred corner of nighttime, I stopped.</p>
<p>I stood there for a moment, looking at the dish, pressing my hand against its rim. Its surface was dotted with cool dew. I leaned against it, testing my weight on it, before I pulled myself up, into the metal basket. I reclined there, my back cupped by the curved walls. Above me nighttime was a cluttered room, the moon chipped and swollen, stars dusty around it. I lay there cradled in the dish, staring up into those greater, more resilient bodies. Then I stiffened myself and waited for signal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Quarter</strong></p>
<p>With the rhythm breaking cleanly over us;<br />
you stepping so well<br />
through the decision, blocking out<br />
quarter-lengths in the swiftly rearranging seconds<br />
crisscrossing the sidewalk. Your heart<br />
is full of blood; we see a movie and a forest<br />
grows though it. The evening is flat in areas<br />
and elsewhere brindled with slippages,<br />
and I believe what you say when you say it,<br />
putting your body through one deliberate motion,<br />
the air plentiful, and we watch<br />
for the minutes as the universe falls<br />
into its assortment of jobs. There is a matter, you think,<br />
that must be what all this weight is for,<br />
a relative equivalent of your architectural sleep,<br />
and I think this, too, with brightness, along<br />
the uneven blocks of the neighborhood, that<br />
a plot could be cajoled out of management,<br />
the sun coming up warm over the necessary and<br />
the stranger standing there looking at us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Decide</strong></p>
<p>We live through a compression of nights<br />
like the underbelly of an airplane</p>
<p>lit bald as it slows toward the dark earth.<br />
The rescue is merely finishing</p>
<p>the work, emptying out the lists<br />
and being moved. We walk down</p>
<p>to the street and say yes;<br />
we say it twice, drawing a line</p>
<p>around ourselves with our breath.<br />
The sensation of falling. Through</p>
<p>our eyelids a dissipating blue.<br />
The force of line. An ontic guttural, </p>
<p>standing contestant sprung<br />
into the hot edge of the immediate</p>
<p>where the promise is lit, our new<br />
mathematics, our new sleep.  </p>
