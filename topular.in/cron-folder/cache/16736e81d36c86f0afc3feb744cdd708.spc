How to Do it!</strong>

There may come a time after your divorce when you no longer want some of the things [hereinafter called "stuff"] you received in your property division.  The reasons may vary from no longer needing it, or wanting it nor do your kids want your stuff.  Maybe the stuff reminds you of the Ex.  Finally, your tastes may have changed. In the words of <a href="http://tidyingup.com/">Marie Kondo</a>, you may want to keep only the things that "spark your joy" You can now honor your true style and not pretend to love his stuff.

Here are suggestions for dealing with the "stuff:"

The<a href="http://www.hoursinfo.com/salvation-army/chicago/4835429/"> Salvation Army Store </a><a href="http://www.hoursinfo.com/salvation-army/chicago/4835429/">o</a>n Clybourn

This store is clean, spacious and bright. Best for books, clothing, kitchen stuff, ceramics, inexpensive artwork  [Note: check with your tax pro on the requirements for donating items whose value is more than $250.] The Salvation Army is a great organization that helps many folks learn job skills. Lots of parking.

<a title="Ebay" href="http://ebay.com">EBay</a>

Using <a title="ebay" href="http://anywhere.ebay.com/mobile/">Ebay </a>is so easy now that you can do the whole process from any smart phone. Just download the app and your are ready to start!  You can take photos and create listings without ever going to your computer.  I have sold costume jewelry, ceramics, glassware, china and clothing using Ebay.  Pair this with a great service,<a href="https://www.shyp.com/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;utm_campaign=branded_keywords&amp;gclid=CKOyvtTd8soCFQKTaQodh80Exw"> Shyp,</a> to pick up, pack and mail your sold items for the cost of shipping plus $5.00 for the pick up.  Think of all the effort and time you save by using this service!

<strong>Auction houses</strong>

A good place to sell higher end paintings and furniture.  Think <strong><a href="http://www.lesliehindman.com/">Leslie Hindman.</a> </strong>There are other auction houses in town, but this is the best one.  Be sure you understand all the costs and fees involved.

<strong>Shelters for abused and homeless women</strong>

Donate to a charity for homeless women.  One example is  <a title="The Greenhouse" href="http://cawc.org/programs/greenhouse/">The Greenhouse  Shelter,</a> a program of <em>Connections for Abused Women and their Children</em>, is Chicago’s oldest program for victims of domestic violence. Full to capacity 365 days a year, Greenhouse served 234 women and children in 2014. To help meet the daily living needs of those women and children, a list of donations is found <a href="http://cawc.org/support-cawc/wishlist/">here</a> and all items are greatly appreciated!

Another service that is helpful for moving big items is <a title="Dolly" href="https://dolly.com/">Dolly.</a> Download app, use it to get a quote and then move your stuff!

<strong>Downsizing and Donating After Your Divorce? Done!</strong>

In the end, you will feel better, lighter! You will have helped others. Please add your comments for other places that you recommend for moving on the "stuff."

<strong>Write about sleep and the impact it has on your life now or at any point in your life</strong>

Once a month, <strong>ChicagoNow, </strong>the platform that hosts my blog,  sponsors an event that challenges us to  blog on a topic provided at 9pm.  We have one hour to write and post a post on a topic....see above.

Hmmmm......

<strong>What the hell does sleep have to do with divorce?</strong>

Sleep is essential in everyone's life!  When you are sleep deprived, you can become a zombie.   Think new baby and how all those wakeful nights are hard. Fast forward 18 years and think when you are waiting up when until  same "baby" returns home from a night out.

Sleep deprivation is terrible. Nothing else matters when you are sleep deprived.  Not food, not sex...nothing except to get a good night sleep.

Since my blog, <strong>DivorceChicagoStyle,</strong>  is about divorce in the Cook County court system, and  is clearly a "high conflict" divorce [12 years and two 20+ trials....if this is not a high conflict divorce, tell me what is?****]  here is how sleep and divorce connect:

"High conflict' divorce which is what I have been dealing with for more than twelve years.... it requires lots of sleep;

Sleep helps me me to deal from the stress of the never ending litigation: every day after the trials,  I would take a nap.

Sleep helps me to regain my energy to get up each day and be grateful for what I have: health, family, friends.

A good night sleep is when I wake up refreshed and  the first thing I  do is to be thankful that I am not still married to the person that broke all our wedding vows to be <strong>faithful</strong> and true.

<strong>A good night sleep makes the world right!  </strong>

*****In case you have not figured this out: this journey is not my choice.  My X told me that he would destroy me in 2003 and enjoy doing same. Of course, he has not done that.  Some folks just do not want to move on.  I  try to find humor in all aspects of my life and  the good news is that every chapter in this saga could be a segment in a TV series.  TV agents: feel free to contact me.

<a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/author/tara-parker-pope/">Tara Parker-Pope</a> is the author of the <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/divorcing-a-narcissist/?nlid=56766463">blog.</a>

Judges and lawyers rarely talk about the role of personality disorders in high-conflict divorces.  Today there are many blogs, mostly written by women,  who do talk about this issue and share  their experiences and offer support.  It is time that this topic  come out of the blog shadows into mainstream media.

If only judges and lawyers would consider the emotional damages and the expense to the non-disordered spouse [and children]-- not to mention the waste of public resources--and cut off the disordered spouse's use of expensive litigation in the courts! Lawyers may fear the loss of income but I bet there will still be plenty of work to go around.  And less stress!

I love this quote from Tara's  review:

<strong>"Keep reading to learn more about narcissistic personality disorder, why it's tough to divorce a narcissist and why long, drawn-out legal battles are a playground for narcissists."</strong>

I am going out now to buy the book! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Ever-Free-You-High-Conflict/dp/1476755698/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440446474&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=will+i+ever+be+free+of+you">Amazon </a>is selling it for $16.24 for a hardcover book.  Kindle and audible formats are also available.

PS:  Although I have been in high conflict divorce related litigation for more than twelve years, with a never ending court battle, I am not calling my former spouse a narcissist.  That is a conclusion that only a mental health professional can make.

The Chicago Divorce Support Meetup Group Monthly Meetup

From the website: "This group is open to anybody, male or female, going through divorce, separation or through a challenging breakup in general.  People find it hard to make the first step to come to a meeting and often comment afterwards how they had wished they had attended months before.  We generally function as an open forum where people can vent their feelings and frustrations, ask questions of each other and generally share their commonalities.  You are not the only one who feels like this."

Go to meetup.com for more information

Note that there are many other divorce related Meetup groups, including "Chicago Divorce Toolkit," Chicago Women in their 30s Facing Separation or Divorce."  And the one I like best: "The Optimistic Divorcees--Chicago!"

I welcome notices of future divorce information events. Send details to divorcechicagostyle@gmail.com.

<strong>Write about a time you lost your temper or somebody lost their temper at you</strong>

<strong>Divorcing his temper tantrums</strong>

Wow! This a a great topic and so on point if you have or are going through a divorce!

Growing up, I rarely saw anyone throwing a temper tantrum.  My parents, and my extended family,  which consisted of six sets of aunts and uncles plus 30+ cousins,  dealt with their disappointments and frustrations in very passive ways: ignoring each other, complaining to others, and drinking too much.  No one ever yelled at me or  my seven siblings.  Our house was loud and boisterous but in a lively and happy way. Our German-Irish family adhered to Emily Post's rules of etiquette and seldom reacted in a way to make a scene and embarrass in public.  It was not a perfect childhood [see this post about<a title="A Childhood Fondly Remembered" href="http://www.chicagonow.com/divorce-chicago-style/2014/12/a-childhood-fondly-remembered/"> my childhood</a>] but it was  good enough.

So then.... I met the man who was to be my husband [and the father of my three fabulous children----thank you very much,  D!].

He had an anger issue.

If he were a speedometer on a car, he was permanently stuck in the 60 to 100 mph range. Always angry!

Who knows why as he was good looking, rich, handsome, smart, and very accomplished.

Still, his angry outbursts would yank the rug from under my feet.

I felt that I was always walking on eggshells.

And it was always MY fault.

So, how did I deal with his frequent and unpredictable anger?

After years of not being able to make him happy, I divorced him.

So now, he should be happy, you would think?

And  has no more anger issues?

NOT!!

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of blogs about divorce, but I like these the best at the moment.  Maybe you would like to write a blog?

<a href="http://http://www.lisaescott.com/blog">Lisa E Scott"s Blog</a>

Lisa's blog is about recovering from being in a relationship with a narcissist. If you are divorcing a narcissist or just breaking up with one, you need this advice.  She has written books, including <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Path-Forward-Surviving-Narcissist/dp/0985832703/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433179590&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+path+forward">The Path Forward</a>, and<a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Its-All-About-Him-Narcissist/dp/1599552183/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433179675&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=its+all+about+him"> It is All About Him.</a>

<a href="http://https://onemomsbattle.com/">One Moms Battle</a>

Tina battled on her own  without a lawyer [mostly] to get full custody of her two daughters in Texas.  Her former husband is a diagnosed narcissist and was not a responsible parent in any way.  After about three years, the court agreed with her and full custody was awarded with supervised visitation by the father.  The father has not chosen to see those daughters since then.

Although Tina's battle is over, the blog continues with <a href="http://https://onemomsbattle.com/category/lucy-k-wright/">Lucy's story</a>, another example of what it is like to divorce a narcissist.  Very well written.  It makes you want to reach out and do something to not only her former spouse, but to the judge or judges who let this go on and on.

The website for the blog also has a good list of <a href="http://https://onemomsbattle.com/resources-for-npd-sociopaths-or-high-conflict-divorce/">resources</a> while divorcing a narcissist. Tina has several <a href="http://https://onemomsbattle.com/divorcing+a+narcissist+">books</a>, offers divorce coaching and more.  Kudos to her for making her struggle public and making efforts to change the family court system.  Unfortunately, family courts are state creatures and reforms will have to be at the state level.  However education and awareness of the inadequacies and issues of the system as a whole will go a long way towards that goal.

Do you have any helpful blogs that offer either advice or humor to add to this list?

January is said to be "divorce month."  Divorce lawyers report that more folks file for a divorce in January than in any other month. So just in time, <em><a href="http://www.superlawyers.com/illinois">Super Lawyers Magazine</a> </em>has just released  its list of the best or "super" lawyers by region and practice of law. The selection process is actually patented and intended to create a list of top lawyers in various practice areas that both lawyers and consumers can depend on as objective and exceptional. The "Super Divorce Lawyers in Illinois 2015" included  the following lawyers  in the <strong>Top 100 List</strong>:

<strong>Miles N. Beermann at <a href="http://www.beermannlaw.com">Beermann Pritikin Mirabelli Swerdlove</a>, Chicago</strong>

and

<strong>Leon I. Finkel,  David H. Levy, and Berry A. Schatz --- ALL at <a href="http://www.bergerschatz.com">BergerSchatz</a>, Chicago!!</strong>  There were only four family law/divorce lawyers on <a href="http://www.superlawyers.com/illinois">The Top 100 List for 2015.</a>

Full disclosure:  Leon Finkel has been my  fabulous divorce lawyer since 2003.[Is is even legal to say that?]  I joke that he and I have been together longer than most marriages!  He is now the managing partner at <a title="BergerSchatz" href="http://www.bergerschatz.com">BergerSchatz</a>, so I also work with <a href="http://www.bergerschatz.com">Peter Sullivan</a>,  another brilliant partner.  I have been fortunate to have good representation. [We will talk about fees at another time.  Good lawyers are not cheap!]

Leon and Peter  have not only done my two trials and two appeals, but have have assisted me in getting my support on time [a constant battle with the X] and advised me in mediation efforts [but mediation generally does not work for the likes of X].

It is curious that one of the chief rivals of <a href="http://www.bergerschatz.com">BergerSchatz,</a> <a href="http://www.sdflaw.com">Schiller DuCanto</a> has no one on the  top 100 list!  My X's attorney is with that firm. From trusted sources, I have heard that they have many fine and talented lawyers.

<strong>More Super Divorce Lawyers 2015</strong>

In addition to the <strong>Top 100 list,</strong> there is a more <a href="http://www.superlawyers.com/illinois">extensive list of best family law/divorce lawyers, </a> consisting of three print pages.  At the least, a potential litigant should see if lawyers you plan to interview are on that list. However, there are some firms on that list that I would not touch in a million years.  I have heard horror stories of cases gone wrong at those firms.  As litigants, we come and go.*  Lawyers and judges remain constant players. So careful selection of your divorce lawyer is a must!

[*except for me:  we are awaiting the Illinois Appellate Court decision from the second trial!  I have been in the system for 12 years.  Please note that this is not my choice to be here as I have tried every which way out by offering a win-win settlement.

Tonight's challenge here at <em><strong>ChicagoNow</strong></em> is to write about a favorite childhood memory. I grew up in a  family with seven siblings and numerous types of pets, ranging from a pony, snakes, sheep, dogs and  frogs, to name a few, and  there are so many wonderful times to remember.  Whenever we all get together today, which is often, we joke and tell the stories of  our growing up in such wild and crazy family.  We hand down the stories to the grandchildren at various gatherings, by creating trivia contests about who did this or that. For example, who rode  the pony bareback and got kicked off, or who organized an impromptu fire drill one night while it was snowing.

My parents, who are no longer living, were both wonderful,  each in their unique way.  My mother was thrifty and had a good eye for clever finds.  She shopped thrift stores before it was fashionable.  One of her best finds was a lovely wool kilt.  I wore it for years and years.   At Christmas time, each of us received one of her "garage sale" gifts wrapped in the Sunday comics and tied with red ric-rac ribbon. I will never forget that my first apartment was furnished with items she found at the Salvation Army or Goodwill. Incredibly,  I still have most of them!  Our clothes were traded with aunts who had almost  as many children, but whose ages differed by a year or two from us.  Each of my five brothers always had a navy blazer and khaki pants no matter what their size.

My father was eccentric in a [mostly] loveable way.  He drove around in our upscale suburb with the car windows closed in the summer so that neighbors thought he was driving an air-conditioned car--which it wasn't.  He also bought six sheep to keep our three acres looking like he had mowed them  Think how folks in Winnetka would appreciate that and you get an idea of how this was received by some of our very posh neighbors.  Dad also bought a vintage fire truck, which we rode around in all summer.  He lent it to the church parish for the annual carnival.  No seat belts and an open back with two benches!  Wow, we were lucky!

Summers were the highlight of my childhood memories. Days and evenings were spent outside playing with the neighbor children.  We came home for dinner when my father whistled for us.  We ate dinner every night together with my father serving us--the youngest to the oldest [me]. If  we wanted to talk, we had to raise our hand.  We all had chores--the girls did the inside work and the boys did the outside work, which meant that the boys only worked in the warm weather.

If we got into trouble, the punishments included writing out a statement  many times, like, <em>I will not hit my sister, </em>50 times<em>.</em>  Once we  tried to use carbon paper, but if caught, the punishment was doubled.  The other punishment was to walk to or from school which was  about a mile away.

But all was not perfect and  my parents divorced when I was in college. My mother lived the rest of her life very frugally, so much so that the only inheritance I got was from her.  My father ultimately remarried. When he died on Christmas Day in 2006, his second wife litigated against his estate.  My siblings and I had to contribute to the legal fees for that.  I call this an "out-heritance."

In spite of our 12 year age span, we are still great friends,  visiting each other duirng the year, traveling together, taking care of each other and giving advice to respective neices and nephews. We value our connections even more than we did when we were growing up.  One of  my siblings is disabled and we work together as a team to care for him.

In July 2015, we have planned a reunion.   Every sibling, spouse and almost every grandchild and [now one] great grand child will be there! I hope that this event will be one of the fond  childhood memories for the next generation.

There are many reasons why someone [mostly the woman] cannot file for a divorce.  It can be because the family has few assets.  In that case, if  the income is low enough, there are legal clinics to help---if you can get in to them.

Or,  it is because the moneyed spouse [usually the husband] has control of the assets and funds and will not give the wife the funds she needs to hire a lawyer.

In the second situation, the Illinois divorce laws provide some help for the spouse who does not have access to the marital funds in a series of laws usually termed  "leveling the playing field amendments."  However, these provision do not go far enough [IMHO].  Many an abused or miserable spouse cannot get a divorce because she/he  lack funds for even a retainer.

I have never seen a case where the less moneyed spouse got anything close to 100% of his or her fees paid for by the spouse that controls all the money.  [Note to divorce lawyers reading this:  if you know of a case that does awared most fees to one spouse, please write to me.] The attorney fee issue in divorce is a complicated and an ever shifting area in the law [by virtue of the appellate cases]. Fees can be awarded in pre-decree cases or in post-decree cases [for modification or change in custody issues, for example].  And in a few instances, awarding fees is mandated.

My nomination for a new holiday is "<strong>Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong>.

Why? No one gets married to get divorced, right?  But when divorce comes your way, it is painful beyond words.  It tears you up and re-orders your world.  It makes you doubt who you are.  It is a singularly devastating event. Why not recognize this by noting the day of the divorce decree as your "<strong>Divorce Day Remembrance".</strong>  Yes, most of us would prefer to forget these painful times, yet unless you are clueless, you certainly have learned a great deal  and grown as a human being.  So why remember?  Because when we remember our past, we are less likely to repeat our mistakes in the future.

Married folk have wedding anniversaries, a time when a couple recalls the happy events surrounding their wedding. A time to remember and celebrate why they got married and have stayed together through thick and thin.

<strong>Reflections on "Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong>

<strong>"Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong> would be the day that you reflect back on the marriage that failed.  But the reflections should not be just negative.  Remember why you married and why you divorced.  What lessons have you learned?  And has your next relationship been better for the lessons learned from the prior marriage?

Now what if you have had more than one divorce?  Ok, so   you can have more than one <strong>Divorce Day Remembrance</strong>.  Sometimes it takes several tries to get it right.....and if one is lucky to have had more than one love in their life, so much the better.   As the saying goes, "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again."

We are only human.  We marry because we are optimistic that love will prevail.  And when it doesn't,  it does not mean that you have failed.  No, if you can remember what was good about that marriage and what was not good and take those lessons with you for the next relationship, then you win.

Hence, your "<strong>Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong>  will keep you on your path to achieving lasting love and success in your future relationships!

My "<strong>Divorce Day Rembrance"</strong> is September 21.

Why? No one gets married to get divorced, right?  But when divorce comes your way, it is painful beyond words.  It tears you up and re-orders your world.  It makes you doubt who you are.  It is a singularly devastating event. Why not recognize this by noting the day of the divorce decree as your "<strong>Divorce Day Remembrance".</strong>  Yes, most of us would prefer to forget these painful times, yet unless you are clueless, you certainly have learned a great deal  and grown as a human being.  So why remember?  Because when we remember our past, we are less likely to repeat our mistakes in the future.

Married folk have wedding anniversaries, a time when a couple recalls the happy events surrounding their wedding. A time to remember and celebrate why they got married and have stayed together through thick and thin.

<strong>Reflections on "Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong>

<strong>"Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong> would be the day that you reflect back on the marriage that failed.  But the reflections should not be just negative.  Remember why you married and why you divorced.  What lessons have you learned?  And has your next relationship been better for the lessons learned from the prior marriage?

Now what if you have had more than one divorce?  Ok, so   you can have more than one <strong>Divorce Day Remembrance</strong>.  Sometimes it takes several tries to get it right.....and if one is lucky to have had more than one love in their life, so much the better.   As the saying goes, "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again."

We are only human.  We marry because we are optimistic that love will prevail.  And when it doesn't,  it does not mean that you have failed.  No, if you can remember what was good about that marriage and what was not good and take those lessons with you for the next relationship, then you win.

Hence, your "<strong>Divorce Day Remembrance"</strong>  will keep you on your path to achieving lasting love and success in your future relationships!

My "<strong>Divorce Day Rembrance"</strong> is September 21.
