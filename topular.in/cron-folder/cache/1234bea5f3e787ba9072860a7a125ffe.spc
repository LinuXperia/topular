<p>h month, there&#8217;s a new company (or idea that will soon become a company) sprouting up. But it isn&#8217;t very often that we hear about a new company working to bring some of that high-tech energy into a clothing line. <a href="http://stikeleatherapparel.com/" target="_blank">Stikeleather Apparel Group</a> endeavors to do just that: creatively merge tech-world gadgetry with designer threads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Born and raised in Indy, Ian Stikeleather is a homegrown inventor. But, he&#8217;s not one to merely sit back and enjoy thinking up wild ideas &#8211; he implements them, integrating far-out dreams with practical, hands-on prototypes. A graduate of Ball State University (Entrepreneurship) and the Art Institute of Indianapolis (Fashion Design), Ian has put together a team that is on the cusp of launching their first clothing line. And, being an inventor by nature, he isn&#8217;t just putting out &#8220;a clothing line&#8221; &#8211; he&#8217;s building an entirely new way of interacting with the garments he (and his team) creates.</p>
<p>With their new clothing line, <a href="http://stikeleatherapparel.com/gallery">Affectation</a>, each piece is able to transform into a variety of looks. Fancy a striped collar? No problem. Brass buttons instead of plain white ones? Okay. The cuffs, buttons, collars, lapels, and countless other details are detachable and interchangeable with no sewing whatsoever. Simple customization is the key to Affectation&#8217;s allure. Your outfit seriously has multiple personalities.</p>
<p>When asked how he came up with this detachable/interchangeable idea, Ian began sharing about a different invention of his: Human Habitat. Human Habitat is a line of clothing that allows wearers to control the garment&#8217;s temperature. In the summer, you can flip on the A/C with a wrist-mounted controller. Winter? Turn on the heat. One outfit, heated and cooled, ready for any weather. As Ian began tweaking the temperature-control unit (slimming it down, making it less noticeable), he needed a way to easily remove and replace the electronic heating and cooling modules (in order to clean the garments). Bored of zippers, velcro, buttons &amp; the like, he began researching magnetics. Without giving away the secret to his provisional patents (one for each line) he has found ways to attach and interchange all sorts of interesting things to garments.</p>
<p>When asked what his goal was with Stikeleather Apparel Group, he said, “I want to start brands that own patents. I come up with a breakthrough idea or technology, and then begin building a brand around it. That’s why I called it Stikeleather Apparel <em>Group</em>, and not just Stikeleather Apparel.”</p>
<p>You can find Ian and Stikeleather Apparel Group at the <a href="http://www.theinnovationshowcase.com/" target="_blank">Innovation Showcase</a> on Thursday the 12th at <a href="http://www.developertown.com/" target="_blank">Developertown</a>. Ian is also a founding board member of <a href="http://www.patternindy.com/" target="_blank">Pattern</a>, Indianapolis&#8217; fashion community <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pattern/" target="_blank">meetup</a> group.</p>

Read Mike&#8217;s interview below, then go sign up for the <a href="http://myjibe.com" target="_blank">personal finance</a> wizardry that is MyJibe.com.</p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with concept for your business, and how/when did the business model for that </strong><strong>concept become clear?<img class="alignright" src="https://www.myjibe.com/img/global/myjibe-logo.png" alt="MyJibe: Confidence. Purpose. Peace Of Mind. For You And Your Money." width="251" height="89" /></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The need for a better personal finance product came from personal pain.  I just wanted to know &#8220;what can I afford to spend?&#8221; and &#8220;am I on track toward savings goals?&#8221; and no product really gave me that.  The business model to support it came from experience in banking and technology.  There are 16,000 U.S. banks and credit unions, and, as consumers increasingly bank online, the competition is fierce and existing technology is behind the times. MyJibe offers modern technology and a way to create stronger, more profitable customer relationships.</p>
<p><strong>What made you first believe that starting a business is right for you (i.e. as opposed to working </strong><strong>for someone else)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It&#8217;s the same reason why I married my wife&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t not.  It was a problem that needed solving and we were uniquely positioned to solve it.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges have you encountered?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Dilution.  There are an amazing number of large and small things that need to be done at the same time</p>
<p><strong>What sacrifices have you made to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I quit the well-paying corporate job with great bennies to work 16 hour days and eat PB&amp;J.  I think my wife made the biggest sacrifice though.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, what makes Indiana a great place to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The support system.  Everyone genuinely wants to see others win and will go out of their ways to help make it happen.  Momentum around the startup scene is building.  It&#8217;s great to see organizations and investments like the Orr Fellowship bearing fruit and playing real contributing roles.</p>
<p><strong>If you could give an entrepreneur looking to start a business one piece of advice&#8230;what would it </strong><strong>be?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be wary of the &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; biz dev strategy.  As soon as possible, shorten the distance between your solution and the person who will pay you for it, preferably before you build the product.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">PolicyStat, LLC is the manifestation of most economic development leaders’ visions of how a high tech industry will be built and sustained in Indiana.  It is a company founded and managed by a group of people who developed essential skills while building other successful high tech companies in the state (e.g. Software Artistry, Aprimo, Pan Testing, Exact Target, Interactive Intelligence, Angel Learning and Autobase); it is a company with capital that was reinvested from liquidity transactions at many of the same companies; it is a company that is in one of the hottest technology spaces today (healthcare IT), attacking the opportunity with current technology (cloud computing, open source technology, and offered software-as-a-service); and it is a company whose software engineering efforts are led by a 2007 graduate of Rose Hulman Institute of Technology.  We are the prototypical Indiana early stage company with the credentials to serve as the poster child for many of the economic development efforts around the state.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with concept for your business, and how/when did the business model for that </strong><strong>concept become clear?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The founders of PolicyStat established the company to commercialize a product concept developed during a consulting engagement they performed for a hospital in northern Indiana.  The original business plan was developed by one of the founders in a class at IUPUI.  Its expressed intent was to transform the Intranet site developed in the earlier consulting engagement into a software-as-a-service offering designed to manage the lifecycle of important reference documentation (e.g. policies and procedures) for healthcare facilities.</p>
<p><strong>What made you first believe that starting a business is right for you (i.e. as opposed to working </strong><strong>for someone else)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My entire career has been spent in entrepreneurial software companies.  Almost without exception, each move I’ve made in my career has been to a company that is smaller than the prior one when I joined it.  I realized early on that the thing I am most passionate about is creating something and fostering its early growth.  Startups are where the “rubber meets the road” in the free enterprise system, and they are a great place to be applying my talents.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges have you encountered?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every early stage company encounters its own challenges.  Challenges can come from all angles – the marketplace, the economy, technology, employees, etc.  Some of the biggest challenges I’ve encountered include: deciding how to shrink a company’s workforce when market conditions or business models change; getting stock option-holding employees to realize that an IPO is not an end, but rather a means to an end; and raising money during the months following the Lehman Brothers collapse.</p>
<p><strong>What sacrifices have you made to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cash is king in a start up.  Continuously moving to smaller companies has meant that strict salary growth has had to receive less emphasis in my overall view of compensation.  Almost without exception my cash compensation has decreased each time I have accepted a position at a new early stage company.  I received no monetary compensation at PolicyStat for my first nine months here, and even after three and one half years my overall cash compensation is still less than what it was when I left my last company.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, what makes Indiana a great place to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mitch Daniels and his administration have done an exceptional job aligning the tax policy, incentives, and logistical support within Indiana to foster small company success.  The State of Indiana’s efforts are further helped by a sense of community among the majority of Indiana’s high tech industry participants who all seem to realize that when one company wins we all win.</p>
<p><strong>If you could give an entrepreneur looking to start a business one piece of advice&#8230;what would it </strong><strong>be?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Great companies are bought not sold; so make it your priority to build a great company if you want to maximize your personal investments in it.  When you set out to build a great company, make sure to do so for all of your stakeholders – customers first, employees second, community third – and the rewards will come for your shareholders.  There is no guarantee of success when you set out to build a great company, and it takes infinite patience and a lot of faith to get there</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I like to remind myself that in 2007 I stated that nobody would ever want to buy a t-shirt online.  It is a great reminder to be open minded and flexible, and the try things that don&#8217;t always aline with common sense.  I still eat those words today, and enjoy every minute of it.  We currently sell about 200 tees per day to customers all over the US.  I am very excited about facing the new challenges of international markets and continuing to take market-share from other major online players.  Haunted Flower was started in the &#8220;two-bedroom&#8221; of a tiny two bedroom apartment with about $300, and that is the only investment and/or seed money received to this day.  We hope to have revenues of $2 million in 2011, and we see business continuing to grow exponentially in the future as online shopping becomes even more popular than it is today.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with concept for your business, and how/when did the business model for that concept become clear?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The concept came when I was still working as a store manager for a national chain with shops in malls across the country.  I was something of a turn-around expert and I was moved around a lot to stores that needed a shot in the arm.  This meant my wife had to look for new work and start at the bottom of the ladder at least once a year, we moved about every nine months back then.  I had the idea to start an eBay business buying things on clearance sales and reselling them out of our home.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The actual business model we use today only became clear in the last 12 months.  The concept and mission was always simple, to get products our customers want into their hands.  Building the product pipeline<br />
around that involved a lot of trial and error.  We used to ship everything out of our garage, at one point we bought a house that was more like a warehouse than a home, it had five bedrooms.  We used four for storage and one for sleeping.  When processing thousands to t-shirt products became unrealistic we took a turn towards automation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Today the vendors actually package and ship our merchandise to a fulfillment center that packs and ships orders to customers.  As owners we rarely even see the product.  Customer service, inventory management including ordering and returs, web design, product design and general store management are all outsourced now.  By the end of last year we completed a framework for the product pipeline that will remain completely scalable for as long as we can increase sales.</p>
<p><strong>What made you first believe that starting a business is right for you (i.e. as opposed to working for someone else)?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Great question, I am not sure what the answer is.  Unlike most employees turned entrepreneurs I was very happy at my job.  I loved what I did in retail management, and I liked my supervisors and the corporate structure for the most part.  I think that is why I took a very corporate management approach to my own company, and other business owners I know have commented that they believe it really contributed to the success of my business.  There is something to be said for the discipline and accountability you have to learn as an employee.  For example, I work out of the home.  I could spend all day in my pajamas.  Yet I have developed a bit of a dress code that I call the &#8220;Tight Pants Theory&#8221;.  When I get up in the morning I get dressed as though I was still going to work for a company with a dress code. I don&#8217;t put on a suit and tie, but I wear respectable, clean khakis and a clean, comfortable shirt.  I put on shoes that are similar to what I used to wear in my store before I enter my office.  I enforce this dress code until I have completed the most crucial tasks of the day which usually takes about 3 or 4 hours, then I allow myself to change into shorts, sweatpants, pajamas, whatever.  The motivation is that the dress code is a little less comfortable and forces me to treat my time seriously.  I found quickly if I stay in sweat pants all day I am not half as productive..</p>
<p><strong>What challenges have you encountered?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Most of them were internal to be honest.  The hardest thing is still to operate in the grey area, making decisions and taking action when you don&#8217;t know for sure if you will be right.  Every time I commit to a major purchase of inventory there is a chance customers just wont like it, or that they wont want to pay what I charge.  I think you have to be an optimist without fooling yourself, and that can be a hard line to walk.  Externally there are few challenges that can compare, we live in a world where information and opportunity abound if you have the courage to pursue it.</p>
<p><strong>What sacrifices have you made to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To be honest, I found that the sacrifices to work for someone else were far greater.  When I finally left my retail management job in Dec 2008 (which coincided with stock market crash and the economic crisis, scary times) I was amazed.  I went from working 44 &#8211; 60 hours per week in someone else&#8217;s store in 2008 to working 3 -4 hour days in my house on my own business with financial rewards triple those of my previous job.  I think it comes from what I did before I started my company.  I put myself heart and soul into building my employer&#8217;s brand and balance sheet, and I worked myself to death doing it.  I swear I still act like a 40 year old twenty-something.  With that kind of work ethic and self discipline I found starting and running a company much simpler.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, what makes Indiana a great place to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The people here.  The last two places I lived were Ohio and Michigan, near Detroit.  The economic pain the country has gone through has hit those places and the people who live there very hard.  It is difficult to be optimistic and forward-thinking in those areas, and it is hard to find people who can motivate and inspire you.  Indiana and Hamilton County specifically do not seem as effected, and you can find bright, successful people here to help inspire and motivate you to succeed. Environment is important, even working from home doesn&#8217;t protect you if all you hear when you step outside is negative negative negative. That is one reason I don&#8217;t watch the news or read the newspaper, I just talk to people and the people here in Indiana have a great work ethic, great values and great overall perspective.  It is a fantastic atmosphere to be a part of as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong>If you could give an entrepreneur looking to start a business one piece of advice&#8230;what would it be?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sell your product.  There will be plenty of time to make business cards, register for sales tax, design a logo, website, so on.  Just start selling your product or service on eBay, craigslist, Facebook, door to door, whatever channel suits your idea, get those first twenty sales/clients/whatever before you even think about something else.  If you can&#8217;t sell the product, all those other things will be a waste of time anyway, and the sooner you find out if your product will sell the sooner you can move forward confident you have made the right decision in becoming an entrepreneur.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">PS If I could give two pieces of advice, the second piece would be a reading list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich Dad Poor Dad</li>
<li>The 4 Hour Work Week</li>
<li>Ready, Fire Aim</li>

<p>As many of you know <strong>Omaha has been a rising star in the tech/start up scene over the last few years</strong>. <a href="http://www.bigomaha.com/">Big Omaha</a>, a yearly event that this limited to about 600 people and attracts some of the best and brightest tech stars as speakers and attendees. I haven&#8217;t gone but many friends have and they all rave about the experience. But back to this NPR article.</p>
<div>
<p>The gist of this article can be summed up in this excerpt:</p>
</div>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;While I was there, I met several architects and web designers who all said they moved back to Omaha, at least in part, because of this club (Indie Rock club The Slowdown</em>)<em> and the movie theater (Film Streams) next door.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I know my buddy Rebecca Ryan from <a href="http://nextgenerationconsulting.com/">Next Generation Consulting</a> wouldn&#8217;t be too surprised. This is what she, and others like Richard Florida, have been preaching for years. &#8220;Cool&#8221; cities attract and retain top talent. What makes a city cool? <strong>There is nothing, that I can think of, cooler than Indie Rock.</strong>I&#8217;m talking <a href="http://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork.com</a> stuff here. If you have a city that has venues where Pitchfork bands regularly play then you basically have the foundation for a cool city.</p>
<p>Here in Indy we have seen a local promotion company start to actively fill that void &#8211; <a href="http://mokbpresents.com/">MOKBPresents.com</a>. This is an offshoot of <a href="http://myoldkentuckyblog.com/">MyOldKentuckyBlog.com</a>, which is actually very much an Indiana blog but started by Kentucky native Craig &#8220;Dodge&#8221; Lile (who coincidentally works for <a href="http://raidious.com/">Raidious</a> a web content company here in Indy) when he moved to Indy in the early 2000s. Running the blog and a Sirius radio show lead naturally to booking shows. MOKB Presents brings a wide diversity of mostly Indie Rock acts to Indy. About 50 shows a year.<strong> I don&#8217;t think you can find any entity that is changing Indy&#8217;s national brand (at least for 20 somethings) as much as MOKB. </strong>Think of all the bands that come play Indy and then go tell everyone else about what a great experience, hopefully, they had here. Think of all the fans that see Indianapolis show up again and again on tour schedules, YouTube videos, etc. Word is getting out. Indie&#8217;s coolness increases with every MOKB show. There are others doing great work in this area but I&#8217;m singling MOKB out since they are the clear leaders. How many of you reading this article know about MOKB? Did you go to a show this year? Chances are they were the promoters.</p>
<p><strong>At the same time we are seeing a huge boom in the tech scene here</strong>. Monthly <a href="http://vergeindy.com/">Verge</a> meetings fill up almost immediately. <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Start Up Weekends</a> are becoming regular, very successful events. New tech companies are popping up everywhere like mushrooms. <a href="http://www.developindy.com/">Develop Indy</a> and <a href="http://www.techpoint.org/">Tech Point</a> are noticing and doing what they can, often behind the scenes, to help create the right conditions.</p>
<p>Many of these tech startups are populated with 20 something kids that have grown up on Indie Rock. MGMT, Sufjan Stevens, My Morning Jacket, Wilco, Arcade Fire, etc. <strong>These tech &#8220;kids&#8221; love music almost as much as code.</strong></p>
<p>So you have a bunch of fans on one side that want to go to shows (local and national acts) and on the other side you have bands (local and national) that need tech help and fans. When you start to bring these two scenes you have some amazing synergies. This is what Omaha is witnessing and it is an affordable, effective tactic that Indianapolis should pursue as well.</p>
<p><em><strong> How do we do this?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>We need venues and we need audiences.</strong> Mostly audiences. Tech companies need to consider sponsoring bands, helping them with their tech and marketing needs. If Exact Target, for instance, wants to attract and retain top talent then they why not send out of state prospects a mix of local music? Why not sponsor a showcase at the Vogue? There are endless creative ways to cross-pollinate and collaborate between the tech and music scenes. So let&#8217;s tear down the wall and start making it happen. <strong>Connecting the Indie Rock and Tech scenes will create new jobs and grow our economy.</strong></p>

My present company, PolicyStat, has emerged from the startup phase very successfully, and its story is still being written.  Each company has provided tremendous opportunities for learning, and through it all has taught me that there are three very important rules when it comes to building a great company: deliver customer value, appreciate the contributions of everyone involved and be open to change.</p>
<p><strong>Deliver Customer Value</strong><br />
Great companies, particularly those selling a business-to-business solution, are built around delivering customer value.  Often early-stage companies are founded because of a brilliant product idea, but even the greatest product ideas do not necessarily yield great companies unless they deliver business value to the customer.  Successful product evolution beyond the initial feature set should always follow a path that leads to customer-perceived value rather than technological sophistication or ease of implementation.  The best choice, whether product or service-related, is the one grounded in a basic understanding of the business value being delivered and drives the customer’s perceived business value highest.</p>
<p><strong>Appreciate Contributions</strong><br />
Further, early-stage companies become great companies because of the contributions of everyone involved.  It is not unusual to have an iconic figure that either leads a company or personifies the company’s culture, but that individual is not the company.  Very little could be accomplished without the contributions of each individual team member, and unlike in larger companies, it is very difficult for an underperforming team member’s performance to go unnoticed.  Keeping team members focused on their roles is only part of the answer; the real key is to continually show team members respect and express appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace Change</strong><br />
Probably the biggest lesson I have learned in building early-stage companies into great ones is the need to embrace change; to let go of established models and accept new ideas, new approaches, new perspectives.  Over the years I have watched time and again as people who join early-stage companies from older, established ones try to reestablish the ways of their former employers but fail because the old approach didn’t fit the new situation.  Forcing old ways on new teams can break down team unity, and ignoring new market conditions will almost guarantee a lesser result.</p>
<p>Early-stage companies are the essence of capitalism – this is where the rubber meets the road when it comes to creating new wealth and new jobs.  Success for any new venture is never a given, but by following these simple rules, your company can be on the road to success. Good luck.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1354" title="Pabst" src="http://indianastartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/iStock_000002626099XSmall-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" />In general, the rule against general solicitation means that you cannot advertise, engage in a mass mailing, or issue a press release that discusses the existence of your offering / potential offering of securities. A conservative interpretation of the SEC&#8217;s view is that all potential investors should be people with whom a company, its directors, officers, or full-time employees have a pre-existing business relationship.  If you want to generally solicit, you need to register your securities with the SEC, which means big bucks in legal and underwriting fees (e.g. and IPO).</p>
<p>Now you can officially add social media to the list of no-no&#8217;s (which should have been quite obvious anyways).</p>
<p>Yesterday the SEC announced a settlement with two advertising executives who launched a Twitter and Facebook campaign to buy the Pabst Brewing Company, makers of the questionably classic beer Pabst Blue Ribbon.  They also created a website that is no longer around &#8211; BuyaBeerCompany.com (yes!).  Their stated goal was to raise $300 million to buy Pabst.  So they started taking pledges, and apparently received around $15 million in pledges within a few weeks &#8211; and the full $200 million from 5 million pledgers within 5 months (wow!).  Of course this attracted media attention, which alerted the SEC to the campaign, and of course the SEC got all hot and bothered.  This was clearly a general solicitation, and the SEC was having none of it.   In the end, the two never received the $300 million in pledges, and never collected any money.  The SEC issued an order finding that these two knuckleheads violated federal securities law. As a result, they must cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and from committing or causing any future violations federal securities law &#8211; which the knuckleheads consented to without admitting any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>This was more about setting an example than actually dishing out punishment (they got slapped on the wrist). The clear message is that if you start tweeting to the masses that you are raising money, be prepared to get an SEC boot planted in your rear.  Luckily for these guys they never actually collected any money, and more importantly, never lost any money they may have collected &#8211; because then this would have been about punishment &#8211; and the penalties can be quite severe.</p>
<p>I am not always a huge fan of our securities regulatory scheme &#8211; sometimes it makes it very difficult and expensive for a startup with little capital to raise the capital it needs to get off the ground or expand.  And this is coming from someone who makes a decent living advising business owners who are raising capital.  Still, there is a reason these laws and regulations are in place (scam artists lurking EVERYWHERE).  So if you are raising capital, be careful, and get some good advice.  And stay off the twitter. And the facebook.  And don&#8217;t launch a website called &#8220;PleaseInvestInMyCompany.com&#8221; (I already own that domain name anyways).</p>

<p><strong>Tell us about your startup&#8230;your words&#8230;whatever you want to say.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://dialawg.com"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1337" title="Dialawg Transparent Logo" src="http://indianastartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Dialawg-Transparent-Logo.png" alt="" width="197" height="57" /></a>Dialawg allows important conversations to be had online in a private, trackable, and organized manner.  We are a two-person, Indiana-based startup with a wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary.  Our clients simply &#8220;start a Dialawg&#8221; and then post messages, files, and form submissions as they like. Participants can be added at any point and receive access to everything in the Dialawg.  Features like real-time chat, simple conference calls, and IMAP integration make keeping people connected easy, and at the end of the day, a PDF audit report can be downloaded to verify activity within the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with concept for your business, and how/when did the business model for that concept become clear?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My co-founder, Jeff, has been an attorney for about seven years.  After a few years of practice, he noticed the disturbingly commonplace use of unencrypted email to distribute highly sensitive information to clients, and he approached me with the idea of building an end-to-end encrypted system for transmitting messages and files.  We began by targeting the legal community with a simple solution, and soon realized that we had an opportunity to revolutionize the digital conversation for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What made you first believe that starting a business is right for you (i.e. as opposed to working for someone else)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I&#8217;ve been a creator since I was a kid: one of my first inventions was a reusable band-aid (which wasn&#8217;t such a big hit with adult audiences), and the clubs I started with my friends collected taxes and had loan services. I always knew that I&#8217;d have to run my own business to be truly satisfied, and every professional move I&#8217;ve made since has been another step in that direction. For me, having my own business is just about finding equilibrium.</p>
<p><strong>What challenges have you encountered?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The biggest challenge for us has been getting the word out. As a small, largely self-funded operation, we haven&#8217;t had the luxury of hiring a lot of staff or making expensive marketing moves. We have to balance sales, marketing, and basic business activities with building a fantastic product. We were in operation for over two years before our system led us to the realization that context was the missing ingredient and that our customers should be starting &#8220;Dialawgs&#8221; with each other. Although staying so busy with the day-to-day operations has sometimes prevented us from being able to spend a lot of resources on reaching a wider audience, our hard work is now apparent in our solid, stable platform.</p>
<p><strong>What sacrifices have you made to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since we don&#8217;t have rich uncles or piles of gold in our garages, we&#8217;ve had to simplify our lifestyles and sometimes take on additional work when necessary. Before Dialawg, I had been working on another startup for almost three years. The long nights of coding are over (there&#8217;s only so long you can physically keep that up), but I&#8217;ve been hitting things extremely hard for over five years now. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about patience, humility, and the importance of a life-work balance.</p>
<p><strong>In your opinion, what makes Indiana a great place to start your business?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The low cost of living and high quality of available services in Indiana has been a big benefit to our company&#8211;running an operation as ambitious as Dialawg on such limited inputs may not have been as possible in the Valley.</p>
<p><strong>If you could give an entrepreneur looking to start a business one piece of advice&#8230;what would it be?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Patience and honesty are critical. Starting a business is relatively easy, but sticking it out and refining your work into something truly remarkable always seems to take longer than you might expect. Without being honest with yourself you can&#8217;t build a great product, and without being honest with your customers, you can&#8217;t expect reliable revenue.</p>
