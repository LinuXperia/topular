Yes it is already the second month of 2016 and I have just been sitting back most of 2015 and watching the Chicago paranormal &amp; supernatural field. I take a different view of watching it then many, as most in the field do not take the same view.

Most in the field are just looking at the reflection in the mirrors within the field, while only a few have decided to step back to look in, to view what others outside the field are seeing with the Chicago paranormal &amp; supernatural field.

The looking in view is a study of what others outside of the inner field sees. The only drawback to the view of looking in, one must also change what is needed, instead of thinking because it is their thing or it looks well in a field, a field that is like a room of mirrors. The problem is that the mirrors are two way mirrors, so there are those who are looking in.

More of my thoughts will be coming. Oh no, I am not going to be instructing on what needs to be changed, as that is not my goal. I learned and anyone can, once they step behind the ego and look over it's shoulder to the reflections in the mirrored room.

Photos of what was discovered is included in this article.

I just finished up doing a private psychic readings for a wife and her husband for an hour session. This was one of those readings that took over two months to arrange a date for reasons being either my schedule or theirs. The date was Saturday December 5th, 2015. It will be a date and experience due to what we seen and felt that I will remember as, Spirits of Christmas Past at Senator Humphrey House in Orland Park, IL. Always go by what your senses are telling you when nothing else can explain it.

The wife is an old soul, for those wondering what that means when I use the term, it means one with internal spiritual knowledge. When I escorted them both in to the room I do readings in, the living room, I noticed that the wife picked up on the energy of the room. It is the room that the family for many years held the 'wakes' for the family members who had died. It is also the room that the youngest Humphrey, John Humphrey, waked his mother in back in the 1950's.

As like the majority of the people that enters the Senator John Humphrey House either on the 2nd Sunday of each month from 2pm - 4pm, or during my private readings and paranormal nights, the couple loved the look and feel of stepping back in time. So I offered to take them on a quick tour of the place after the hour of readings. They also were a bit curious to wander around a location with a proven haunted history as the Humphrey House has.

Below you will see the photos from what we seen. They are very unusual as I have never seen this at the Humphrey House in over 7 years of doing what I do there. Orland Historical Society President, Bob Elli was in the building as he is always present when the doors are open. I called Mr. Elli upstairs to show him what we discovered.

It was a first for him also, as no one from the public has been in the building since the last time it was open to the public. The building is fully protected by an alarm system and that has not been an issue, nor was there any damage to the building do to any unwanted entry.

This photo shows what we seen at the entry of the bedroom of Mrs. Humphrey. It is a necklace on the floor, it has been broken and one end of it pointing out of the room and in the direction of the children's bedroom. Many know of the feelings I and other Spirit Feelers have picked up about the 2nd wife of Mr. John Humphrey.

This second photo is of what we seen on the floor of the bedroom of Mrs. Humphrey. It was pushed a bit under the bed, like someone kicked it under the bed, not pulled it away from the bed. Also the clothing on the left edge of the bed looks as it has been pushed over to the side.

In this photo, you will see what is very unusual for this room. The shoes on the bed have been thrown about and the piece of clothing at the top right side of the bed, was just laying messed up as if someone dropped it there after wearing it .

This is in the Children's room and one of the strongest rooms to feel the energy of emotions in. This room like the rest of house, is kept in order with all pieces belonging in their own place. That is why I never seen what I seen in this room, the children blocks scattered on the floor.

Then came the discovery of the rocking horse in the children's room. It has always been there in the room, as it was the actual horse of the youngest child (John Humphrey), and last Humphrey family member to live in the house before turning it over to the Orland Historical Society.

What you will see in the photo and is the discovery being talked about here, is the horse is leaning to one side as if it was leaned on. Could little John Humphrey been returning to claim his horse and blocks? A photo of him sitting on this rocking horse, was the Christmas Card Photo he as an adult, would send out every year to his closest friends, as he loved the rocking horse and he kept it.

What you are looking at now, is right before the entry in to the large room with the most emotional energy feelings of sadness. It is what has become known as the children's playroom and one that has been of many experiences for individuals who have had the opportunity to experience the different levels of energy in this room.

You see the wastebasket knocked over and the pieces of paper from it on the floor. The interest thing is the bottom of the wastebasket is sitting against the door and is usually sitting near the desk in this room leading in to the room of emotional energy.

This is the living room or as I like to introduce it as, the Wake Room. I wanted to give you a look of the room that many bodies rested in peace for family and friends to view.

These are the stairs leading up to the rooms pictured above. This past Saturday December 5th, 2015, they seemed to Mr. Bob Elli and me, to have had some activity going on. Yes it is at times an entry to the feelings of the past in the home, do to the energy of emotions left behind from the past of those who lived there as a family.

This second photo is of what we seen on the floor of the bedroom of Mrs. Humphrey. It was pushed a bit under the bed, like someone kicked it under the bed, not pulled it away from the bed. Also the clothing on the left edge of the bed looks as it has been pushed over to the side.

In this photo, you will see what is very unusual for this room. The shoes on the bed have been thrown about and the piece of clothing at the top right side of the bed, was just laying messed up as if someone dropped it there after wearing it .

This is in the Children's room and one of the strongest rooms to feel the energy of emotions in. This room like the rest of house, is kept in order with all pieces belonging in their own place. That is why I never seen what I seen in this room, the children blocks scattered on the floor.

Then came the discovery of the rocking horse in the children's room. It has always been there in the room, as it was the actual horse of the youngest child (John Humphrey), and last Humphrey family member to live in the house before turning it over to the Orland Historical Society.

What you will see in the photo and is the discovery being talked about here, is the horse is leaning to one side as if it was leaned on. Could little John Humphrey been returning to claim his horse and blocks? A photo of him sitting on this rocking horse, was the Christmas Card Photo he as an adult, would send out every year to his closest friends, as he loved the rocking horse and he kept it.

What you are looking at now, is right before the entry in to the large room with the most emotional energy feelings of sadness. It is what has become known as the children's playroom and one that has been of many experiences for individuals who have had the opportunity to experience the different levels of energy in this room.

You see the wastebasket knocked over and the pieces of paper from it on the floor. The interest thing is the bottom of the wastebasket is sitting against the door and is usually sitting near the desk in this room leading in to the room of emotional energy.

This is the living room or as I like to introduce it as, the Wake Room. I wanted to give you a look of the room that many bodies rested in peace for family and friends to view.

These are the stairs leading up to the rooms pictured above. This past Saturday December 5th, 2015, they seemed to Mr. Bob Elli and me, to have had some activity going on. Yes it is at times an entry to the feelings of the past in the home, do to the energy of emotions left behind from the past of those who lived there as a family.

Every year I write about this, as one thing I personally know by experience and witness during the psychic house parties I do that include doing Spirit Communications, is the missing of those loved ones who have passed away.

One of the things that I am honored to do, is attempt to bring closure to those who have lost a loved one. The Holidays are the hardest for individuals and if the passing away of a love one has been recent, it also tugs at my heart strings. This why I like to have individuals experience the Spiritual World with those they know and loved, instead of Spirits that are strangers as in ghost haunting.

For others receiving word of their own personal illness and not having the strength of words from a loved one who has passed is also an empty feeling for individuals. Then it becomes a special thought to know that a loved one is looking down upon the individual and as I say, is the individual's first level of Spirit Guides and protection.

Just because the love one is no longer in the living world, that does not mean their love for their living loved ones and family gatherings are gone. Usually it is stronger as the Spirit cannot be here in the living and are missing those still in the living world.

What I suggest to those who miss their love one who has passed away, is something that would be for both the Spirit and the living. First, I ask the person if they still have a photo of their loved one? Majority of the time the answer is yes, and usually the person says that they have a photo hanging up in their house.

It is great that the person has a photo of the loved one who passed away in their house. However like the family gatherings and holidays, something a little special could be done, something that will show the Spirit of the loved one that they are still part of the holidays and family gatherings as in the past.

I suggest that the person takes the photo of their love one into the main room that the family gathers in during the holiday. Some individuals tell me that they have a photo of their love one already in that room. If that is the case, I tell them that is fine, but to take the photo and move it to another area in the room.

When the person either brings a photo into the room of the family gathering or moves the photo to another area in the room, it actually is a way of focusing on the loved one who passed away and this is a way of connecting to the Spirit.

It also is a way for the Spirit to know that they are still part of the holiday family gatherings. The Spirit of holidays past is still part of the present and the love is shown to the Spirit and in return, felt by the living.

Blessings and Happy Holidays,

The label states, Chicago Psychic Medium, Paranormal Host and Author and yes that would be my label. Everyone has to have a label to be noticed, some try harder then others with some changing or adding a new first name in exchange of their birth given name. Some individuals in the field even use a totally created mystical name.

That is fine for them, I rather use my name as there is no need for anything more then the ability to provide for the individuals what they have come to you to experience. I have been to many a house party where they could not remember the this or that person that provided what ever they provide, and why? That little bit of information I will keep to myself.

A known story is when Arnold Schwarzenegger first started in body building, he was advised to change his name as no one would remember it, nor even be able to pronounce it. He said he would not change it and that it would be a known name. He was right, and the reason why is because he was someone people would not forget.

Recently at the Palos Paranormal Conference, there was a very good turn out for my talk and the Spirit Communication Demonstration I did on the Saturday of the conference. Even though I was booked to speak last, after a day of doing readings all day, the turn out was very good.

The question that was asked during the day on Saturday and also I talked briefly about during my discussion and demonstration, was my paranormal experiences and discovered locations. I mentioned as I always do, Mr. Richard Crowe is the individual who found many Chicago Paranormal locations and made them known to the general public by way of being the first one talk about it on Chicago radio shows and the first to host ghost tours in the Chicago land area. Mr. Crowe also brought the locations to individuals by way of his book.

I have always said to have been very lucky to in different ways, been led to new paranormal active locations by way of my instincts. I have in the past also been given copies of letters that pertain to the spirit world or historic haunted locations. I will later in this blog also list a possible new location that I will be able to experience on Tuesday the 27th of October in the Downtown Chicago area.

Also being an author of my own two book that are based on my spiritual and paranormal experiences. They can be found on Amazon, just type in my name as author, or just click on this link:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Edward-Shanahan/e/B006LQ8NV0" target="_blank"> Edward Shanahan Author on Amazon</a>.

I also mentioned that there is one Chicago author of many paranormal books and he actually experiences what he writes about (as I also do), and that is rare with the many books out there. He also is a true paranormal investigator for many years and has his own team. His name is Dale Kaczmarek. Dale is a couple to a few years older then me, so he was wandering locations before I started at the age of 16 years old, 41 years ago.

Even though his approach to the supernatural is different then mine and I do use paranormal investigators often at locations. The thing is we both have lived in the area of the S.W. Suburbs all our life and have had the opportunity to experience the locations any time we desire. I have also been an assistant on a few tours for a Chicago ghost tour business, as I knew the area and had actually experienced all of them and attempted to have others experience the locations on the tours.

<strong>For those who would like to view</strong> a video of the actual tour and all the locations on Pinterest, just go to: <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/edwardlshanahan/chicago-haunted-tour-locations-of-archer-ave-and-m/" target="_blank">Chicago Haunted Tour Locations of Archer Avenue and more</a>. Also a <strong>Free Archer Avenue Ghost Tour App</strong> with audio, photos and GPS can be found at: <a href="http://www.geogad.com/geogad/customtour?ctid=158" target="_blank">Free Ghost Tour of Archer Avenue</a>. Some ask why the free Ghost Tour App? The answer is the locations are free to visit and they are meant to be experienced at the pace the individuals desire to do so.

<strong></strong><strong>Paranormal and Supernatural Experiences. </strong>
I have had many experiences and to rate them would be hard to do. What is the most meaningful is when I provide that experience for others who attend a location I am speaking at and provide a spirit communication demonstration, or the psychic house parties I work and proved spirit communications at the end of the night for everyone, or the haunted locations that I provide the experience for individuals.

<strong>The last haunted location experience date was</strong> <strong>Oct. 3rd 2015</strong> at Senator Humphrey House and the ended night with my Circle of Energy Seance in the living room, as that is where they waked so many family members. This is the comment I received from an Investigator named Kathie, and was there that night. She is a member of Dale Kaczmarek's team and this is what she posted: "<em>Several of our loved ones came through loud and clear during the night's end seance... amazing! Thank you Edward Shanahan! The night far surpassed my expectations</em>". That is what I try to provide for people.

When asked what experiences stand out? There are a few and I will name a some and why they do.

<strong>Paranormal Kicks Cancer - 2011. </strong>This week I just confirmed my notes with Chicago book author Frank Heiberger about what went down that day during my Circle of Energy Seance, as it ended with it. A good conference that was put on by Laura Redmond.

It came my time to do my Circle of Energy Seance, the conference was held at a Holiday Inn near O'Hare Airport and the challenge for me is there was no history of paranormal activity at the location. I walked in to the conference room and there were 45 people there and I would say 85% where paranormal investigators, meaning mostly skeptics. I figured the reason they were already sitting there was to make sure I was not doing any Hocus Pocus stuff. Even one of the stars of the Paranormal Cops TV show was in attendance for this. All paranormal tools were on the tables as where two sets of Ghost Boxes at each side of the room.

I passed out my sheets of paper with the Spirit Invocation for everyone to read at the start of my Seance. At the time I smoked and I excused my self why I went to have a cigarette, but in reality I just wanted a little time outside to myself, as I looked up at the blue sky and said out loud, I need you Spirits to kick some butt, as there are mostly skeptics to what I do, inside the room. If it does not happen, I will not be able to look at Facebook for a month.

I walked back in to the room with all the confidence in the world, as I knew what I had to do. That was to invite all and any spirit to enter that room and that is what I did. The reason I love skeptics, is the spirit world can make skeptics wonder what the heck just happened?

People started to channel, some seeing and feeling things, one person had to get his wife out of there as she could not stand hearing the voice coming out of the Ghost Box calling out her name. One individual rushed out of the room and was being interviewed by those filming and showed where his arm was scratched up. When I heard the police officer from Paranormal Cops TV show start challenging a spirit, I decided then it was time to close the seance.

When the lights came on, some were a little shaken. Some just sat there wondering what just happened. There was Jim Heaters (paranormal investigator), sitting there crying and being comforted by a couple women. As Frank Heiberger wrote me about it <em>'Jim Heater had a very emotional experience of feeling regret and missing his mother's pancakes. He had a death grip on my hand. I only remember that it was the first (paranormal experience) he ever had'. </em>

So I did consider it a success. Individuals wanted to see what I could do, if anything. I needed the spirits to come through and the spirits did not let me down. Maybe they disappointed a few who hoped I would not be able to pull it off, but I delivere<strong></strong>d with the help of the spirit world.<a href="http://youtu.be/wLCEVf-EKE8?t=1m56s" target="_blank"><strong>
</strong></a>

<strong>That is not the only experience that stands out</strong>, there is the spirit of the Screaming Child caught on a voice recorder along with a whimpering dog. This was captured on recorder by Sheri Perkins in 2011 during a 12 minute time frame during a Paranormal Night I held at the haunted Sedamsville Rectory. 3 segments captured during the 12 minute time frame.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xRpsu02t9o" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
The location has been even featured on Ghost Adventures. The video above was captured the first time there for me. I followed that up with two more trips to the location. It never disappointed and was very active all the times. One time even the sounds of a woman screaming 'Don't Shoot!!!' right on the edge of the grounds and gun shots being heard. That caused a couple of the men that were standing outside, to run back in to the rectory. Later the next day when contacting the police and asking about the gun shots heard, there were no police reports about any type of shots or shootings in the city at all that night.

<strong>The next video</strong> is from the haunted Willow Creek Farm in Shannon, IL. It took place Sept. 2010. Beside the paranormal activity experienced by those participating as it was my Circle of Energy in an attempt to raise the spirits so they interact with the individuals who participate. Also a very good EVP of one of the spirits was captured on this video tape.

<strong>Then there was the Chicago Ghost Tours burning bus.</strong> It became an interesting tour, as I was asked to assist on this tour and I even made the arrangements for something that had not been done before, the ability to actually explore the Saint James Church and Cemetery as a group on the Saturday of the tour as long as it was before the start of the 5pm Saturday Mass. Well the tour host and rental bus were two hours late getting to Chet's Melody Lounge, a haunted location stop that I would join the tour at.

The problem was the bus transmission and the lack of anyone thinking about having another bus that was running right, meet them and carry on with the tour. Well the bus chugged along after picking me up and I finally said this is stupid and could the driver have a bus meet us somewhere in Willow Springs?

It was arranged as he finally pulled in a 7-11 and put a call in to his company. He then drove to the Willowbrook Ballroom so the host could talk about the paranormal history there and I then talked about the activity I had experienced at the location across the street, known as the Irish Legend.

After leaving that location, the driver attempted to drive west from the Willowbrook Ballroom to Saint James Cemetery. This meant taking the road of Archer Avenue that I have named the 'Stretch of Death' do to the road side memorials of those who have died driving that road. The bus finally stopped for good about fifty yards from the driveway to Saint James.

As we sat there, I received a thought message telling me that we needed to get the people off the bus now. So I informed the tour host that we needed to get the individuals off the bus and I will do so, and the host needed to lead them to the driveway of Saint James.

I told the individuals, instead of sitting on the bus waiting for the second bus to come, I would help them cross to the other side of Archer Avenue and they can walk the fifty yards to get to the driveway of Saint James and start the tour then.

I followed the last tour passenger and as I walked on to the driveway to join everyone else, there was a loud crash heard from the direction of the bus. A car driving west and coming around the curve hit the corner of the driver back side of the bus and then drove the car across the road in to the edge of the woods.

The shaken driver staggered out of his car and the bus driver for whatever reason was standing a distance away and behind the bus. Within seconds of the bus being struck by the car, the bus went up in flames and burned right down to the ground.  All of us were safe, many shaken because we all knew if we would of stayed on the bus, we would of been dead.

The tour host was shaken and stood at the beginning of the driveway in tears looking at the burning bus that we were just in. I decided the best thing to do was get the people up by the Church where it was warm, since it was the early part of December.

The Pastor of Saint James was not pleased as no one was showing up for his 5pm mass, as the Willow Springs Fire Department shut down The Stretch of Death, Archer Avenue. I did mention that he did have a captive audience of about 30 people with that being us. He was not amused. It ended well and everyone  was safe. The amazing thing is that they said they did have a unique experience.

<strong>Discovery of Paranormal Locations. </strong>

That is what I suggest every Paranormal Investigator or Spirit Feeler should seek out, the discovery of new location. Not just follow in the footsteps of someone else. In the Chicago land area, I actually would say it is following in the footsteps of Richard Crowe if one is just wandering the same areas of haunted locations turned upside down and inside out by others so that they possibly can make a claim to catching a whisper that sound like a whisper, instead of what so and so was trying to pass off being more then just passing gas.

I have come across new haunted locations in the Chicago land area and given people exposure to them as I held paranormal nights at them.

<strong>There is a possible new location and I will for a one time</strong> private paranormal / spirit communication night, that will be held there on this coming Tuesday night, 10/27/15. Those who are having me out there, have talked to individuals who have had paranormal experiences at the location.

<strong>The Company having me out there is Threadless and their web site is at:</strong> <a href="http://www.threadless.com" target="_blank">Threadless.com.</a>

They plan to broadcast this Paranormal Night and my Circle of Energy Seance with Spirit Communications on Periscope.com. I know nothing about Periscope.com but I figure those interested in viewing the demonstration and location will figure it out. The start time will be 9pm.

<strong>The location is the</strong> <b>Courthouse Place</b>, also known as the <b>Cook County Criminal Court Building </b>at 54 West Hubbard Street in the Near North Side of Chicago. Designed by architect Otto H. Matz and completed in 1893, it replaced and reused material from the earlier 1874 criminal courthouse (the same location of the trial and hangings related to the Haymarket Affair).[2] The complex included the Cook County Jail and the hanging gallows for prisoners sentenced to death. The current structure housed the Cook County Criminal Courts for its first 35 years, and was the site of many legendary trials. The above information came from: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

There has been my discovery of the Haunted Senator John Humphrey House in Orland Pk. The discovery of the haunted location that what was once the Al Capone's Cullerton Hotel in Chicago, that I held paranormal daytime events at. The Chicago Valentine's Boys and Girls Club that I brought paranormal nights of the haunted location to the general public.

Showcasing the spirit activities of the Ashbary Coffee House years ago with the original owners John and Deanna, along with the spirit activities of the surrounding properties. The opportunity to work with five different owners of the haunted location known today as the Irish Legend in Willow Springs and bring the experience of the paranormal to individuals.

Then the discovery of the spirit activity of the Native American land named after a Chief and is near the Irish Legend. On that land with a few people I performed for the first time my Circle of Energy Seance. There is also the haunted home of Mayor White that I was introduced to and then that I held a couple paranormal nights in for people to experience.

Yes readers I believe there are more place to be discovered as I have proven in the past. This coming week if you venture out looking, you could be the one to discover it. Make sure you are the one to give it the exposure first, if you do discover a possible haunted location.

Happy Hauntings,

Edward Shanahan

The label states, Chicago Psychic Medium, Paranormal Host and Author and yes that would be my label. Everyone has to have a label to be noticed, some try harder then others with some changing or adding a new first name in exchange of their birth given name. Some individuals in the field even use a totally created mystical name.

That is fine for them, I rather use my name as there is no need for anything more then the ability to provide for the individuals what they have come to you to experience. I have been to many a house party where they could not remember the this or that person that provided what ever they provide, and why? That little bit of information I will keep to myself.

A known story is when Arnold Schwarzenegger first started in body building, he was advised to change his name as no one would remember it, nor even be able to pronounce it. He said he would not change it and that it would be a known name. He was right, and the reason why is because he was someone people would not forget.

Recently at the Palos Paranormal Conference, there was a very good turn out for my talk and the Spirit Communication Demonstration I did on the Saturday of the conference. Even though I was booked to speak last, after a day of doing readings all day, the turn out was very good.

The question that was asked during the day on Saturday and also I talked briefly about during my discussion and demonstration, was my paranormal experiences and discovered locations. I mentioned as I always do, Mr. Richard Crowe is the individual who found many Chicago Paranormal locations and made them known to the general public by way of being the first one talk about it on Chicago radio shows and the first to host ghost tours in the Chicago land area. Mr. Crowe also brought the locations to individuals by way of his book.

I have always said to have been very lucky to in different ways, been led to new paranormal active locations by way of my instincts. I have in the past also been given copies of letters that pertain to the spirit world or historic haunted locations. I will later in this blog also list a possible new location that I will be able to experience on Tuesday the 27th of October in the Downtown Chicago area.

Also being an author of my own two book that are based on my spiritual and paranormal experiences. They can be found on Amazon, just type in my name as author, or just click on this link:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Edward-Shanahan/e/B006LQ8NV0" target="_blank"> Edward Shanahan Author on Amazon</a>.

I also mentioned that there is one Chicago author of many paranormal books and he actually experiences what he writes about (as I also do), and that is rare with the many books out there. He also is a true paranormal investigator for many years and has his own team. His name is Dale Kaczmarek. Dale is a couple to a few years older then me, so he was wandering locations before I started at the age of 16 years old, 41 years ago.

Even though his approach to the supernatural is different then mine and I do use paranormal investigators often at locations. The thing is we both have lived in the area of the S.W. Suburbs all our life and have had the opportunity to experience the locations any time we desire. I have also been an assistant on a few tours for a Chicago ghost tour business, as I knew the area and had actually experienced all of them and attempted to have others experience the locations on the tours.

<strong>For those who would like to view</strong> a video of the actual tour and all the locations on Pinterest, just go to: <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/edwardlshanahan/chicago-haunted-tour-locations-of-archer-ave-and-m/" target="_blank">Chicago Haunted Tour Locations of Archer Avenue and more</a>. Also a <strong>Free Archer Avenue Ghost Tour App</strong> with audio, photos and GPS can be found at: <a href="http://www.geogad.com/geogad/customtour?ctid=158" target="_blank">Free Ghost Tour of Archer Avenue</a>. Some ask why the free Ghost Tour App? The answer is the locations are free to visit and they are meant to be experienced at the pace the individuals desire to do so.

<strong></strong><strong>Paranormal and Supernatural Experiences. </strong>
I have had many experiences and to rate them would be hard to do. What is the most meaningful is when I provide that experience for others who attend a location I am speaking at and provide a spirit communication demonstration, or the psychic house parties I work and proved spirit communications at the end of the night for everyone, or the haunted locations that I provide the experience for individuals.

<strong>The last haunted location experience date was</strong> <strong>Oct. 3rd 2015</strong> at Senator Humphrey House and the ended night with my Circle of Energy Seance in the living room, as that is where they waked so many family members. This is the comment I received from an Investigator named Kathie, and was there that night. She is a member of Dale Kaczmarek's team and this is what she posted: "<em>Several of our loved ones came through loud and clear during the night's end seance... amazing! Thank you Edward Shanahan! The night far surpassed my expectations</em>". That is what I try to provide for people.

When asked what experiences stand out? There are a few and I will name a some and why they do.

<strong>Paranormal Kicks Cancer - 2011. </strong>This week I just confirmed my notes with Chicago book author Frank Heiberger about what went down that day during my Circle of Energy Seance, as it ended with it. A good conference that was put on by Laura Redmond.

It came my time to do my Circle of Energy Seance, the conference was held at a Holiday Inn near O'Hare Airport and the challenge for me is there was no history of paranormal activity at the location. I walked in to the conference room and there were 45 people there and I would say 85% where paranormal investigators, meaning mostly skeptics. I figured the reason they were already sitting there was to make sure I was not doing any Hocus Pocus stuff. Even one of the stars of the Paranormal Cops TV show was in attendance for this. All paranormal tools were on the tables as where two sets of Ghost Boxes at each side of the room.

I passed out my sheets of paper with the Spirit Invocation for everyone to read at the start of my Seance. At the time I smoked and I excused my self why I went to have a cigarette, but in reality I just wanted a little time outside to myself, as I looked up at the blue sky and said out loud, I need you Spirits to kick some butt, as there are mostly skeptics to what I do, inside the room. If it does not happen, I will not be able to look at Facebook for a month.

I walked back in to the room with all the confidence in the world, as I knew what I had to do. That was to invite all and any spirit to enter that room and that is what I did. The reason I love skeptics, is the spirit world can make skeptics wonder what the heck just happened?

People started to channel, some seeing and feeling things, one person had to get his wife out of there as she could not stand hearing the voice coming out of the Ghost Box calling out her name. One individual rushed out of the room and was being interviewed by those filming and showed where his arm was scratched up. When I heard the police officer from Paranormal Cops TV show start challenging a spirit, I decided then it was time to close the seance.

When the lights came on, some were a little shaken. Some just sat there wondering what just happened. There was Jim Heaters (paranormal investigator), sitting there crying and being comforted by a couple women. As Frank Heiberger wrote me about it <em>'Jim Heater had a very emotional experience of feeling regret and missing his mother's pancakes. He had a death grip on my hand. I only remember that it was the first (paranormal experience) he ever had'. </em>

So I did consider it a success. Individuals wanted to see what I could do, if anything. I needed the spirits to come through and the spirits did not let me down. Maybe they disappointed a few who hoped I would not be able to pull it off, but I delivere<strong></strong>d with the help of the spirit world.<a href="http://youtu.be/wLCEVf-EKE8?t=1m56s" target="_blank"><strong>
</strong></a>

<strong>That is not the only experience that stands out</strong>, there is the spirit of the Screaming Child caught on a voice recorder along with a whimpering dog. This was captured on recorder by Sheri Perkins in 2011 during a 12 minute time frame during a Paranormal Night I held at the haunted Sedamsville Rectory. 3 segments captured during the 12 minute time frame.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_xRpsu02t9o" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
The location has been even featured on Ghost Adventures. The video above was captured the first time there for me. I followed that up with two more trips to the location. It never disappointed and was very active all the times. One time even the sounds of a woman screaming 'Don't Shoot!!!' right on the edge of the grounds and gun shots being heard. That caused a couple of the men that were standing outside, to run back in to the rectory. Later the next day when contacting the police and asking about the gun shots heard, there were no police reports about any type of shots or shootings in the city at all that night.

<strong>The next video</strong> is from the haunted Willow Creek Farm in Shannon, IL. It took place Sept. 2010. Beside the paranormal activity experienced by those participating as it was my Circle of Energy in an attempt to raise the spirits so they interact with the individuals who participate. Also a very good EVP of one of the spirits was captured on this video tape.

<strong>Then there was the Chicago Ghost Tours burning bus.</strong> It became an interesting tour, as I was asked to assist on this tour and I even made the arrangements for something that had not been done before, the ability to actually explore the Saint James Church and Cemetery as a group on the Saturday of the tour as long as it was before the start of the 5pm Saturday Mass. Well the tour host and rental bus were two hours late getting to Chet's Melody Lounge, a haunted location stop that I would join the tour at.

The problem was the bus transmission and the lack of anyone thinking about having another bus that was running right, meet them and carry on with the tour. Well the bus chugged along after picking me up and I finally said this is stupid and could the driver have a bus meet us somewhere in Willow Springs?

It was arranged as he finally pulled in a 7-11 and put a call in to his company. He then drove to the Willowbrook Ballroom so the host could talk about the paranormal history there and I then talked about the activity I had experienced at the location across the street, known as the Irish Legend.

It is becoming that time of year with the color changing of leafs, that thoughts of spooky fun things to do this season in the Chicago land area are of interest. Lets see if I can add some things you have not thought about or even knew was out here and would allow you to have even more fun.

<strong>If you have watched the TV paranormal shows</strong> you know what EVPs are. Well here is something that the magic world has created that will allow you to have great fun with friends as you ask them to pull out their phone and you record EVPs using their phones.

Also this video below is a little education on what is now out there and just be cautious if a paranormal or psychic type of person tries to impress you with collecting EVPs using your phone and they hold it.

This shows the fun that you can have with EVP and is a review of it.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDvuXrvZSyk" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<strong>Here is another fun spooky thing</strong> <strong>you can pull on your friends</strong>. It has been around for awhile and one day I had to bust someone's bubble as they showed me what their friend said was captured using the friends phone at his friends house. The guy showing me was a thrilled to see spirits and was a mean joke his friend played as he knew how his friend would react (a little overboard reaction to wanting to see ghosts). I told the individual how it was done and is another creation of the magic world.

So if you are just interested in having some spooky fun with your friends or want to be the hit of one of those Chicago Ghost Bus Tours, here is something you may be interested in (or combine this item with the one in the above video), or if you want to play the 'Did you see that?" and pull your phone out and presto you have ghosts to prove what you seen, have fun with this.

<strong>Free Ghost Tour of the haunted S.W. Suburbs haunted Archer Avenue</strong> and surrounding area using the free ghost tour app. Your friends or family would like to go on the Chicago Ghost Tour, but the prices are high for some of the tours. The 'Bring Your Own Booze' concept that some ghost tours are doing, is not of interest for those with families or those not interested in the unlimited consumption of booze being added to something that is supposed to be fun, entertaining and educational.

[caption id="attachment_1122" align="alignleft" width="150"]<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-paranormal-and-spiritual/files/2015/09/displayhq4.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1122" alt="Free Ghost Tour App" src="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-paranormal-and-spiritual/files/2015/09/displayhq4-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a> Free Ghost Tour App[/caption]

I created the free App and I have actually experienced the locations due to the fact I have lived my whole 57 years less then 10 minutes from the areas showcased and I have been visiting them since I started to drive 41 years ago. So it is the experience of one who actually has experienced the locations and is my free gift to those interested in also exploring the locations, as it is not about the money.

The free app takes away the window shopping type of ghost bus tour and allows individuals to take as much time as they desire at locations to discover the locations and possibly what is haunting them. The app has 16 haunted locations stops. Audio for each of the stops, a GPS map to guide you and photos.

<strong>It is free and can be found at: <a href="http://www.geogad.com/geogad/customtour?ctid=158" target="_blank">Chicago Haunted Archer Avenue Tour App</a>.</strong>

<strong>Want to visit a haunted historic home in the S.W. Suburbs? </strong>There is the historic Senator John Humphrey House in Orland Pk. IL. It is open on the second Sunday of each month from 2-4pm and there is no cost for the house tour, but a donation of any size is always welcomed.

No ghost investigations or other access to paranormal fun is performed on the Sunday open house days. That is reserved for those seeking to book a paranormal night there that is also possible to have me assist the whole night and guide you and your friends to experience the spirits of the location.

<strong>Palos Paranormal Conference Oct 10th and 11th returns to Moraine Valley Community College. </strong>This is the most successful paranormal conference in the Chicago land area and grows in attendance every year and I have been with it since the beginning. I will be doing readings all day and because of my schedule it is rare that I do readings at public locations. Individuals can have readings and can run 10 minutes to 30 minutes if one desires.

<strong>Saturday I will be speaking at 5pm</strong> and may even attempt a <strong>demonstration of Spirit Communication</strong> for those seeking it for love ones who passed and I will demonstrate how it is done at the psychic house parties that I work and you can have. Also if time allows, some discussion on the area's haunted locations and being one who has actually lived their who life in the area and have experienced the locations for 41 years, when I started to drive.

The Palos Paranormal Conference 2015 is a comprehensive, exciting metaphysical experience. The conference will feature speakers throughout the day lecturing on topics such as UFOs, spirit reading, energy manipulation, haunted history of the area, miraculous healing and the power of gems and minerals.

Many of the vendors also offer opportunities to schedule private parties, private or group martial arts/self-defense lessons, suggestions for gemstones or other tools that might work best for you and even plan ghost tours or ghost hunting in the areas many haunted spots.

<strong>For more details on the conference</strong>, it is only $15 for one day or $20 for both days, visit their web site at:<a href="http://www.palosparanormal.com/index.html" target="_blank"> <strong>Palos Paranormal Conference</strong></a>.

<strong>
Having a House Party or Holiday Corporate Party? </strong>Then consider one that has been awarded Best Chicago Psychic to entertain your guests. When I work a Psychic Party, I allow the host to decide what they would like to provide for your guests and it is not based on a per person fee, just an hourly fee and this allows you different offerings for the entertaining night of psychic readings.

Most house parties like to end the night with my Circle of Energy Spirit Communication or Seance. It is not one of those things that has the psychic sitting at the table and saying the spirit of so and so is here etc.. What I attempt to provide is a way for the individuals as a group to communicate with the spirits.

When two  Readers are requested, I do have one that I only invite as I know her abilities and I know she is an entertaining reader also. Right now I am booked on Saturday's up until the start of November. The last week of October, Friday evening is still open.

<strong>For those seeking more information</strong> for having an entertaining house of corporate party and what I provide, visit the web site: <a href="http://bestchicagopsychic.com" target="_blank"><strong>Best Chicago Psychic</strong></a>.

<strong>Seeking a Ghost Tour Host for your group outing?</strong> Being one who has lived their whole life within 10 minutes of the Chicago land area most haunted locations, and has knowledge of locations the ghost tours do not take you to, I would be willing to discuss being a host for your adventure.

Well that is about it for now.
Enjoy this spooky season,

It is becoming that time of year with the color changing of leafs, that thoughts of spooky fun things to do this season in the Chicago land area are of interest. Lets see if I can add some things you have not thought about or even knew was out here and would allow you to have even more fun.

<strong>If you have watched the TV paranormal shows</strong> you know what EVPs are. Well here is something that the magic world has created that will allow you to have great fun with friends as you ask them to pull out their phone and you record EVPs using their phones.

Also this video below is a little education on what is now out there and just be cautious if a paranormal or psychic type of person tries to impress you with collecting EVPs using your phone and they hold it.

This shows the fun that you can have with EVP and is a review of it.

<strong>Here is another fun spooky thing</strong> <strong>you can pull on your friends</strong>. It has been around for awhile and one day I had to bust someone's bubble as they showed me what their friend said was captured using the friends phone at his friends house. The guy showing me was a thrilled to see spirits and was a mean joke his friend played as he knew how his friend would react (a little overboard reaction to wanting to see ghosts). I told the individual how it was done and is another creation of the magic world.

So if you are just interested in having some spooky fun with your friends or want to be the hit of one of those Chicago Ghost Bus Tours, here is something you may be interested in (or combine this item with the one in the above video), or if you want to play the 'Did you see that?" and pull your phone out and presto you have ghosts to prove what you seen, have fun with this.

<strong>Free Ghost Tour of the haunted S.W. Suburbs haunted Archer Avenue</strong> and surrounding area using the free ghost tour app. Your friends or family would like to go on the Chicago Ghost Tour, but the prices are high for some of the tours. The 'Bring Your Own Booze' concept that some ghost tours are doing, is not of interest for those with families or those not interested in the unlimited consumption of booze being added to something that is supposed to be fun, entertaining and educational.

I created the free App and I have actually experienced the locations due to the fact I have lived my whole 57 years less then 10 minutes from the areas showcased and I have been visiting them since I started to drive 41 years ago. So it is the experience of one who actually has experienced the locations and is my free gift to those interested in also exploring the locations, as it is not about the money.

The free app takes away the window shopping type of ghost bus tour and allows individuals to take as much time as they desire at locations to discover the locations and possibly what is haunting them. The app has 16 haunted locations stops. Audio for each of the stops, a GPS map to guide you and photos.

<strong>It is free and can be found at: <a href="http://www.geogad.com/geogad/customtour?ctid=158" target="_blank">Chicago Haunted Archer Avenue Tour App</a>.</strong>

<strong>Want to visit a haunted historic home in the S.W. Suburbs? </strong>There is the historic Senator John Humphrey House in Orland Pk. IL. It is open on the second Sunday of each month from 2-4pm and there is no cost for the house tour, but a donation of any size is always welcomed.

No ghost investigations or other access to paranormal fun is performed on the Sunday open house days. That is reserved for those seeking to book a paranormal night there that is also possible to have me assist the whole night and guide you and your friends to experience the spirits of the location. You can email me for information about it at: <a href="http://bestchicagopsychic.com" target="_blank">Best Chicago Psychic</a>.

For many people, young and old, it is never to early to think what will be neat to do for Halloween coming up. With Halloween being on a Saturday this year, it will be great to celebrate for all ages.

Halloween ideas and concepts are non-stop and over a hundred can be found at this Pinterest page: <strong><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/edwardlshanahan/halloween-ideas-concepts/" target="_blank">Halloween ideas and concepts</a></strong>.

Have you seen a Halloween Village? They are very very wonderful and only limited by one's imagination. The Halloween Village accessories has maybe grown faster then the Christmas Village accessories in recent years.

The combination of Halloween Villages and Decorations may as a whole be outpacing the Christmas theme of decorations.

Halloween Villages are still  a new concept that many individuals are just starting their collection of spooky stuff and creating their own village that will keep growing. I would not be surprised if someday you will come across the Best Halloween Village Contest, just as they now have the Best Halloween Decorated House Contest.

To give those interested a head start as it is never to early to get deals, I posted this below as there are hundreds of items. You can also find it at the:<strong> <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/halloweenvillages-20" target="_blank">Halloween Village and Decorations Store</a></strong> on Amazon.

The date has been set for the Chicagoland Paranormal Conference as it returns to Moraine Valley Community College on October 10th and 11th 2015. It has always been held in Palos, IL and is called the Palos Paranormal Conference.

This will be the 4th annual event, each one has been more successful then the last.  It is also one of the most successful paranormal conference to be held in the last three years in the Chicagoland area and one of the reasons it has been welcomed backed to Moraine Valley Community Collage.

The reason that this event has been a success is for the fact it is directed toward the general public and their interest and it provides interactive experiences for those attending.

This conference showcases those in Chicago land area who are involved in the Paranormal, Supernatural, UFO's, Healing, Psychic Readings and more. There will be speakers all day for both days.

This event even provides great exposure for those participating as you are be exposed to the general public, not just others in the same field striving for the same as you. The general pubic is where it is at and what you should strive for, not to just shake hands with others in the same field at a high priced meet and greet.

As a vendor you are treated as you matter, not just a backdrop to the others being showcased.

The list of those participating and speaking is still being arranged, but last year seen an assembly of people that are experts in a wide range of paranormal, metaphysical and spiritual disciplines.

Entertaining speakers and vendors representing the fields of UFO investigations, Psychic Readings with and without tools, some of the aspects Haunted History, Ghost Hunting, how to use sound to defend yourself against attack, Shamanic and Reiki Healing, Aura Reading and Hypnotic Past Life Therapy.

This is one of the rare public readings dates that I do and will be doing both days. I will be doing rare public location private readings, possibly speaking and maybe doing Gallery Readings. Time will tell.

Tom Cameron is the producer of the event, he takes it seriously and it is not nor has it ever been an event based on him or to showcase him. It is about those participating and those coming out to attend it.

I believe that is the reason it has kept growing and has become successful over other ones in the last three years. I have been with it from day one, a choice I am happy I made, and I am very selective.

More details will be coming out soon, just write down the dates for this Chicago fun event that I believe ticket prices will only be $12.50 or just $20.00 for the weekend.

The date has been set for the Chicago Paranormal Conference as it returns to Moraine Valley College on October 10th and 11th. It has always been held in Palos and is called the Palos Paranormal Conference.

This will be the 4th annual event, each one a success over the last and one of the most successful ones in the last three years in the Chicago land area.

The reason that this event has been a success is for the fact it is directed toward the general public and their interest plus it provides interactive experiences for those attending. This conference showcases those in Chicago land area who are involved in the Paranormal, Supernatural, UFO's, Healings, Psychic Readings and more. There will be speakers all day for both days.

This event even provides great exposure for those participating as you are be exposed to the general public, not just others in the field, the general pubic is where it is at and what you should strive for, not to just shake hands with others wearing team t-shirts. Plus you are treated as you matter, not just a backdrop.

The list of those participating and speaking is still being arranged, but last year seen an assembly of people that are experts in a wide range of paranormal, metaphysical and spiritual disciplines. Speakers and vendors representing the fields of UFO investigations, Fortune Telling with and without tools, some of the aspects Haunted History, Ghost Hunting, how to use sound to defend yourself against attack, Shamanic and Reiki Healing, Aura Reading and Hypnotic Past Life Therapy.

Tom Cameron is the producer of the event, he takes it seriously and it is not nor has it ever been an event based on him or to showcase him. It is about those participating and those coming out to attend it. I believe that is the reason it has kept growing and has become successful over other ones in the last three years. I have been with it from day one, a choice I am happy I made, and I am very selective.

I will be doing rare public location private readings, possibly speaking and maybe doing Gallery Readings. Time will tell.

More details will be coming out soon, just write down the dates for this Chicago fun event that I believe ticket prices will only be $12.50 or just $20.00 for the weekend.
